Social media sites, smartphones, and other </td></tr><tr><td>consumer devices including PCs and laptops have allowed billions of individuals around the world to </td></tr><tr><td>contribute to the amount of big data available. And the growing volume of multimedia content has </td></tr><tr><td>played a major role in the exponential</td></tr><tr><td>growth in the amount of big data (see Box 1, “What do we mean by ‘big data’?”). Each second of </td></tr><tr><td>high-definition video, for example, generates more than 2,000 times as many bytes as required to </td></tr><tr><td>store a single page of text. In a digitized world, consumers going about their day—communicating, </td></tr><tr><td>browsing, buying, sharing, searching—</td></tr><tr><td>create their own enormous trails of data.</td></tr><tr><td>In itself, the sheer volume of data is a global phenomenon—but what does it mean? Many citizens </td></tr><tr><td>around the world regard this collection of information with deep suspicion, seeing the data flood </td></tr><tr><td>as nothing more than an intrusion of their privacy. But there is strong evidence that big data can </td></tr><tr><td>play a significant economic role to the benefit not only of private commerce but also of national </td></tr><tr><td>economies and their citizens. Our research finds that data can create significant value for the </td></tr><tr><td>world economy, enhancing the productivity and competitiveness of companies and the</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>public sector and creating substantial economic surplus for consumers. For instance, if US health </td></tr><tr><td>care could use big data creatively and effectively to drive efficiency and quality, we estimate </td></tr><tr><td>that the potential value from data in the sector could be more  than $300 billion in value every </td></tr><tr><td>year, two-thirds of which would be in the form of reducing national health care expenditures by </td></tr><tr><td>about 8 percent. In the private sector, we estimate, for example, that a retailer using big data to </td></tr><tr><td>the full has the potential to increase its operating margin by more than 60 percent. In the </td></tr><tr><td>developed economies of Europe, we estimate that government administration could save more than</td></tr><tr><td>€100 billion ($149 billion) in operational efficiency improvements alone by using big data. This </td></tr><tr><td>estimate does not include big data levers that could reduce fraud, errors, and tax gaps (i.e., the </td></tr><tr><td>gap between potential and actual tax revenue).</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>Digital data is now everywhere—in every sector, in every economy, in every organization and user of </td></tr><tr><td>digital technology. While this topic might once have concerned only a few data geeks, big data is </td></tr><tr><td>now relevant for leaders across every sector, and consumers of products and services stand to </td></tr><tr><td>benefit from its application. The ability to store, aggregate, and combine data and then use the </td></tr><tr><td>results to perform deep analyses has become ever more accessible as trends such as Moore’s Law</td></tr><tr><td>in computing, its equivalent in digital storage, and cloud computing continue to lower costs and </td></tr><tr><td>other technology barriers.3 For less than $600, an individual can purchase a disk drive with the </td></tr><tr><td>capacity to store all of the world’s music.4 The means to extract insight from data are also </td></tr><tr><td>markedly improving as software available to apply increasingly sophisticated techniques combines </td></tr><tr><td>with growing computing horsepower. Further, the ability to generate, communicate, share, and access </td></tr><tr><td>data has been revolutionized by the increasing number of people, devices, and sensors that are now </td></tr><tr><td>connected by digital networks. In 2010, more than 4 billion people,</td></tr><tr><td>or 60 percent of the world’s population, were using mobile phones, and about 12 percent of those </td></tr><tr><td>people had smartphones, whose penetration is growing at</td></tr><tr><td>more than 20 percent a year. More than 30 million networked sensor nodes are now present in the </td></tr><tr><td>transportation, automotive, industrial, utilities, and retail sectors. The number of these sensors </td></tr><tr><td>is increasing at a rate of more than 30 percent a year.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>There are many ways that big data can be used to create value across sectors of the global economy. </td></tr><tr><td>Indeed, our research suggests that we are on the cusp of a tremendous wave of innovation, </td></tr><tr><td>productivity, and growth, as well as new modes of</td></tr><tr><td>competition and value capture—all driven by big data as consumers, companies, and economic sectors </td></tr><tr><td>exploit its potential. But why should this be the case now? Haven’t data always been part of the </td></tr><tr><td>impact of information and communication technology?</td></tr><tr><td>Yes, but our research suggests that the scale and scope of changes that big data are bringing about </td></tr><tr><td>are at an inflection point, set to expand greatly, as a series of</td></tr><tr><td>technology trends accelerate and converge. We are already seeing visible changes in the economic </td></tr><tr><td>landscape as a result of this convergence.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>Many pioneering companies are already using big data to create value, and others need to explore </td></tr><tr><td>how they can do the same if they are to compete. Governments,</td></tr><tr><td>too, have a significant opportunity to boost their efficiency and the value for money</td></tr><tr><td>they offer citizens at a time when public finances are constrained—and are likely to remain so due </td></tr><tr><td>to aging populations in many countries around the world. Our research suggests that the public </td></tr><tr><td>sector can boost its productivity significantly through the effective use of big data.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>However, companies and other organizations and policy makers need to address considerable </td></tr><tr><td>challenges if they are to capture the full potential of big data. A shortage of the analytical and </td></tr><tr><td>managerial talent necessary to make the most of big data is</td></tr><tr><td>a significant and pressing challenge and one that companies and policy makers can begin to address </td></tr><tr><td>in the near term.
