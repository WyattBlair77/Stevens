# Final Exam Submission Guidelines

* For Questions 1 and 6, you can only submit an Excel file (.xlsx format). If you export the Excel as a PDF and submit it, it will NOT be graded. Your calculations must make the use of Excel Formulae, and not just values. (Check attached image)
* The remaining questions are programming ones, and require you to submit either a .R or .ipynb file. py, Rmd files and exports (PDF / HTML) will not be graded and you will be given a 0 for that particular question.
* For questions 2 and 3, splitting the dataset into training and testing is not required. You must form clusters for all the rows of the dataset (features have already been specified in the question), and cross tabulate the clusters with the State column.

**The deadline for submission has been set to Monday (May 6th) 11:59 PM. Any late submission (after 12:15 AM) will result in a flat 20 marks penalty.**
