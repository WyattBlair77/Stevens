[ __ ] what a shield. alya is what a pedophilia she'll he is. now by the way i don't even know what she'll means. but i'll tell you something by the way they're saying. it i know i'm not oh yeah. chris d'elia way to. [ __ ] defend pedophilia hey man i'm not doing that and the thing is you know it so dude it's so unbelievable man oh look into. this guy oh this. guy obviously was [ __ ] when he was a kid he's covering it up. people commented that hey are you a real guy hey hey dude i've got something. to tell you this is earth. that's not how it is. imagine me and i just got [ __ ] when i was a kid. just and i couldn't stand it. hearing about pizza gay. because it drummed up. too much [ __ ] i was like no no that's why i don't allow. myself to believe that somebody went to. a place called [ __ ] cosmos pizza in dc underground. into a basement that size of a closet. and i had a [ __ ] [ __ ] fest with hillary clinton imagine that's why i didn't believe it the reason why i don't believe it is do people want to. believe some [ __ ] so hard they want to. believe some [ __ ] so hard because they just [ __ ] don't i get it dude. it's romantic as [ __ ] to. think about stuff and believe in it. it's romantic as [ __ ] you think i you think i don't want to. believe in batman you think i don't want. to believe i am batman. you think i don't want to. believe that [ __ ] you think i don't want to. believe that harry potter. can go out there and [ __ ] shoot shoot people and turn them into. pumpkins you think that i don't want to. believe that i do want. to believe that but i don't believe. that because of my brain. because i'm 40 because i'm developed. and because i have things going on now. i get it if you don't have much. going on then you want to. believe in this [ __ ] okay well let's look at do your research that's my favorite [ __ ] do your research do your research bro oh you mean [ __ ] google it you can google anything you can google you can google right now probably monkeys make maida an automobile and they were [ __ ] a video will come up where monkeys are making an automobile and there'll be some guy in [ __ ] the backwoods of alabama. like well you know i had these pets. and needed some help. with my cars and i just kind of left. them together you know with the old ford. pickup and i don't know. if it was them. technically or not but i woke. up one day and it was it. was in much better. condition than when i left. it and i actually turned the key. and it worked so i'm not saying it. was the monkeys but it could have. been that's a video that. i just made up that is absolutely. a video because the internet. has everything dude do your research dude. oh my god dude he's a shill i love it. i love it go ahead. believe it that's fine. but it's crazy how mad that's the thing. i always say is how come you can't. just disagree with somebody and not. want them to be [ __ ] like literally dead. or dragged by a [ __ ] horsey it's just so weird. once a comedian or anybody tutt know. a comedian touches on and jokes. about something that you decide is too far. you get up in arms no no. no [ __ ] that dude i love tupac. talk [ __ ] make a joke. go ahead guess what ha ha. ha ha it's all good. man no that's our cool. man to. parks off limits go [ __ ] yourself nothing's off. limits so if i'm talking [ __ ] about pizza gate. why because all of a sudden. you're a conspiracy theorist. i gotta shut the [ __ ] up why. who are you ever see. that [ __ ] old tim meadows bit on snl. he's like welcome to. to 20 questions with whatever character. he's playing and then he asked one. question and then they're like they did they answer. it and then he says why and there's and then there's a counter and it. goes to and then they answer. that and he says why and then it goes. three and he keeps going why four and they say. well i don't know because yada yada. yada why and he just does it. 20 times and then he says this has been 20. questions with tim meadows tim meadows. is so funny and i want to. say that he's the most underrated. snl character but i don't say people are underrated. i don't do that because that's a backhanded. compliment and let me tell you about this. conversation i had off of a text. chain now here's the deal. text chain arguments conversations they're the hottest [ __ ] since. lasagne okay they really are they're the hottest [ __ ] since the pipe and ass cheese. goes in your mouth and it gets and it dangles too low. but it's also outside of your mouth. so you end up going that [ __ ] when you're a kid. when you're a kid and you're just like what. do i pull it or turn it. suck it suck it further. and as a nineyearold you're like hey it was nice knowing. y'all just dead with crosses out over. the eyes like a cartoon raggedy ann doll. anyway um [ __ ] what was i talking about the [ __ ] day what text chain i did that [ __ ] hot text chain and i was do it i think here's the thing about me when i get into. a [ __ ] hot argument or a heated argument if my [ __ ] is lasagna myself guess what dude i agree with me that's how i know i'm right okay i'll put out a tweet where i said something like that and it got like [ __ ] 20,000 likes so that's how you know people feel the same so that's how you know i'm right all right but my [ __ ] is i [ __ ] agree with myself man a backhanded compliment is to. say somebody is underrated and here's my thing. my friend said hey rogan. called a joe rogan. call on his instagram called. adam sandler happy gilmore and underrated underrated comedies and he was like how could you call adam. sandler underrated comedy and i was like yeah that's crazy. he's like the number one. rated and then my friend was like well saying that. it's underrated maybe means that you know. because people maybe talk [ __ ] about his movies they shouldn't be talking [ __ ] about another that came in that devolved into. a whole conversation is what is. underrated is it okay to. say somebody's underrated or not like i have fans. come up to. me and they said you're underrated. man i love you. and what i hear and maybe it's my insecure. self i hear people don't think that. you're as good as you. should be but i do and to. me don't tell me any don't tell me. you don't like me don't allude. to anything about how peep i mean. just come up and say hey good job. hey thank you very much. all right so my buddy. was calling me an idiot. now here's one here's here's here's one. thing we were doing the voice. that's texting so i can't. read it we were speaking. into it and sending the shits. and my buddy was high as [ __ ] so first of all his arguments out the door but still he thought he was killing. it so he was like if somebody's saying you're underrated. if somebody's saying you're underrated what they're saying. is most things that are rated highly speak to. the lowest common denominator in some way. so they're saying that those dummies. aren't smart enough to. like you okay and i'm saying no what you're doing. is adding a bunch of words. to somebody saying people don't like you as much. as i do and he was saying. you're so wrong how does it. feel to be wrong. and i'm saying whatever i said something. i would write back and i [ __ ] agree with me. and he would be like that's the most crystal. ear thing ever to say. and i go you're damn. right cuz i'm me dude. and i agree with me. and my brother didn't agree. with me and my other friend didn't. agree with me and my other friend was kind of on. the fence but it was fine. because i knew i was right. and that's how we gotta live our lives. dude from from now on that's how we got to. live our lives man. believe in what the [ __ ] you're saying you ever. talk to somebody and they're like oh i don't. know oh yeah okay well alright like one time i was working with a director and i saw him. talk to another actor and he was like you want. to try this and the actor looked at me. now we both locked eyes. and thought bad idea whatever. that director said awful. idea and the guy the other actor goes like this. i don't know i don't think that'll work and the director goes like this. alright well i just thought was okay and retreated backwards. twisting his wrist that's the most. [ __ ] thing you can do is just be like okay uh yeah and so he did that and then that's it if a director makes that one [ __ ] retreat move twisty arm. [ __ ] your movies gonna suck bro your movies gonna suck you could have done the revenant you could have been like learn how to. caprio get in that bear and they're not a camper you'll be like i'll wait a beat and then get in it and then you're like okay uh okay that movie's gonna suck [ __ ] leonardo would be like [ __ ] that we're all out here in the middle of nowhere gotta be out here and this was gonna suck [ __ ] eduardo lavon's korone or whoever did that movie it's probably not even that director that i'm trying to. [ __ ] think of um eduardo lavon's corona you know um so you did the shape. of water whatever the [ __ ] that guy's name is you know man. i want to. watch the some movies. i just want to. watch so bad and i just won't ever watch. them like shape of water i think it. looks so interested and then i go. to look at it. on the [ __ ] netflix or itunes whatever. it is and then i look at it. for a little bit and i go. yeah and i think i'll die. before i watch that. movie and it's probably great and people will be like you should really go. see it you really should see it. you really really should see it. won the oscar and i go like this. yeah yeah yeah and i'll never see. it um anyway eduardo allophones. karoon killed that [ __ ] movie probably but i'm an ignoramus uh believe in yourself is well i'm trying to. say don't [ __ ] out but yeah one time i went to. a man one time. i was playing above [ __ ] i must have been 21. and i was beefy. dude when i was 20. when i was beefy. you think the [ __ ] lord of the rings have a place. to shoot right now. bro forget that they did. all those movies back. then okay right on the back. of my [ __ ] shoulders i would hear way in the background oh yeah that's right. and dude like eduardo lavon's cabron. could do [ __ ] revenant back. here revenant to. t oo revenant also uh and so. uh i was with my buddy. who is [ __ ] goddamn hilarious. intentionally and also unintentionally like one time. we were talking about one. time we were talking we were mmhmm. i was probably 23. this is before this is after i'm doing it. like pulp fiction i'm doing. a little bit here and then i'm going. back a little bit and they find out. i was dead at the end. so he was like he was like hey you know he wasn't really getting chicks. the way he wanted to. get chicks he wasn't getting. laid and he wanted. to get laid because. he was [ __ ] twenty five six something i mean and one time he was like i was like well why don't you just like hit on not as hot chicks you know you might have a better chance and this way you work your confidence up and then you start hitting on you know hitting hitting on and hook it up with the heart attacks and he was like and he was getting so frustrated at the time and he would always do this that's how i learned that this is [ __ ] he and he said and dude i'll never forget this he said he said he said i will not hook up with some substandard girls i will not talk up with substandard girls and dude and i will never forget that i will not hook up with substandard girls and dude and i was like ah i think that was the first time i went and it was awesome and i laughed and that guy hasn't been laid in two years now and this is 20 years later i just talked to. him sadness real life sadness. you think shits going on dude. you think people are [ __ ] you think what corona the economy. you think that this shit's [ __ ] everything. up my buddy hasn't gotten laid for. two years sadness sadness. you know what i mean. like that's that's brutally but you know. i guess it's the kind of thing. like one time when i was in a car. pool i should be carpool gonna kid. going to school. with a kid with a bunch of different. kids in a van with that. [ __ ] siding that was like a wooden siding. [ __ ] whoever put cars with the wooden siding. on the outside it's like what. are you making a car or a [ __ ] house what is the breaking. bad how mobile so one time. and the kid the older. kid he said yeah i don't really watch tv. i said really he said yeah. cuz one time i was grand. i couldn't watch tv all summer. and then i just came in got into. the habit never really wanted. to watch tv and that's what's happened. with my buddy only what it happens. to do with getting his dick. wet and i'll tell you what that. is 100% not sensational so that is absolutely. not sensation that is absolutely. not sensation um anyway let's see i was telling oh yeah. so this is what i was going. back to it like i go. back back back my [ __ ] his steps i went a little bit forward i went back. and it's like timecop you go back. and forth or pulp fiction. just in a different editing way. so my [ __ ] timetravels okay so um thought i just stepped in [ __ ] so anyway we were doing this thing game with a bunch of girls and guys and my buddy we had to. hum a song like. the first few seconds of a song and then whoever guessed it. got a point or some [ __ ] whatever it was the [ __ ] worst game of all time and we couldn't do the lyrics like you couldn't be out there and just be like i'll put a sign up right in the front window advertisement right. in the front window. and all of a sudden success. coming out of the blue. because and you'd be like mushnik and son little shop. of horrors of course right. so so this guy was gonna sing this. song this guy was gonna sing this. song downtown

rosa okay go ahead and he goes and then he goes downtown and started crying. the only thing he had to. do was not say downtown and he goes downtown and we my other buddy. and i who we looked at each other. immediate beetred faces and we started. crying like japanimation and then my buddy. got and embarrassed that he said the word downtown that he [ __ ] pivoted deena [ __ ] it was like he was tony gwynn swinging the bat he just [ __ ] twisted and walked over to. the chinup bar and [ __ ] grabbed it. and did two chinups he did. two [ __ ] chin up stood out. of business imagine being so insecure. and such that he was doing the twist. even when he was sitting he was going. downtown and then he realized that it. we [ __ ] started japanimation crying. and he twisted walked. on over he

[ __ ] go ahead when you start walking you can use those low holes. to look in check out. the side yard. buddy [ __ ] can't wait i can't wait to. teach my son almost illegal. [ __ ] you know what i mean almost illegal [ __ ] and then it goes like yeah but that isn't that bad and i go like this not if you know the words how to. describe it not if you know how to. describe it not if you know how to. describe it but isn't peepin. bad excuse me son we're just looking oh. i get it now look in that. papen yeah so i got in i got a question. too about only fans. and i know i've talked about this. and i caught some heat. on the podcast but if i'm not catching heat. i'm not relevant so throw the heat. my way man this. shit's hot i'm ready but only fans. is an interesting thing because why. do girls do it okay. now i don't mean why do all girls. do it but i'm what i mean. is why do all the girls. who do it do it. now that's different now if you were my buddy. on a texture and you would argue that this. is the same and i would get mad. and i would say too late. i agree with me but all the girls. who do it don't need to. do it most of the girls. that would do it i would argue don't. wanna be doing it do. you know why because they're showing you. their fried butterflied but fried. butterfly and if you need any more explanation than than that. this conversation or podcast. isn't for you because one time. i was like hey dad my dad. said yeah we were at a basketball. game for some [ __ ] reason who was i but my dad was like we were talking about porn porn and porn and my dad was like yeah i don't know i always thought was kind of odd when a girl was a porn star and i was like wanted to. be wanted to. do porn i was like why. he was like i don't know i feel like you know. maybe it means like something. happen in your childhood. or whatever and makes you fit whatever. he was saying i don't know if we're gonna want to. out them you know but i was like yeah but you could probably be a really full complete welladjusted person. and still do porn and he was like yeah. i guess you're right but then it's like he said but then it's like imagine you're like yeah. i'm a welladjusted person i could get a real. job and i can do things. and i have hopes and dreams. but instead of that i just want guys to. come on my face. and i was like hmm very good point. okay and we were at the clippers. game who was i why why do why were we there he got free. tickets or some [ __ ] so only fans is interesting. because it's that whole thing. where it's like why doesn't every girl. on instagram have at least 20,000 followers. like you can do it. girl you can do anything. cuz your girl and guys are dumb a lot. of those girls would take a sugar. daddy a lot of those girls. would just marry for money. a lot of those girls. are really hot if you're hot. why are you doing only fans. if deep down you just want to. marry a [ __ ] you don't have to. [ __ ] do all that [ __ ] because people who do only fans for the same thing. goes for people who do instagram. for for money you don't guys. girls whatever i'm this isn't. this is not a sexist. thing but like you know. you don't want to. work that hard you know. what i'm talking about you don't. want to work that. hard that's why you're [ __ ] going like this hey $3 to. see my [ __ ] right so what are you doing doing it it's so interesting. to think about look i love that. there's only fans and i love when people do only fans because love see and tits love seeing tits i got it man. i see a drake yeah. but it's just so fascinating. man that some [ __ ] this kovat thing app and i get it and you're like well i can't go out work so [ __ ] i want to. show you my [ __ ] so that's guy get that make your [ __ ] money dude for the people that really want to. do it do it i guess. this may be just like being in another. job it's like yeah i don't wanna. be [ __ ] bagging groceries. or whatever or at cratenbarrel. ringing up these [ __ ] [ __ ] plates but it's just kind of what i fell into. i guess it's the same. thing we figured it out. but hot girls can just get a free. ride man they can literally get a free. ride like a literal free. ride like a hot girl can. see you drive by and be like scuse me. and you'll go and be like yes sweetheart. and it goes like can i get a ride. and you're

fortunate man. i really am fortunate sure i worked hard. and stuff but i'm really lucky. to be in the position. that i am and i realized that. and i try i do think about that. a lot and and my brother. directed this special and it's just so cool. that he did it because i love him. and i mean i really love him. like it's so awesome. to have somebody like that like people always say like oh how many kids you want. to have and i'm like two's good. because i had one brother and no sisters. and no other brother. and everything that i didn't could. couldn't talk to anybody about i would do. it with matt because he was the only guy and that bond because of that is awesome. now i'm not saying if you have three brothers. or two sisters and a brother or whatever. you don't have that but for me. i always felt cool that there. was one other person that i can confide in and just know that. that [ __ ] was down to. ride and so was i for him. and of course i had an open. you know family with my mom. my dad i could talk to. them about everything i mean. the first time i masturbated i walked down. and i told them. and i walked down and i said and i was crying. and for real dude. i was a [ __ ] and i and i said to. my mom and my mom. said what the hell's wrong. she was eating like [ __ ] jelly. beans my mom would always eat the jelly. beans and she would shuck him. around her hand a little bit. before she popped them in her. mouth dude it drove me. nuts i was like why. don't you just pick him. up and [ __ ] eat him. what if to make it. a game like that he needs a new pair. of shoes a there we go. but i was crying and she was like what's wrong. and i said it happened. and i thought she knew what. i was gonna talk about she said. what and i said coming and she said i [ __ ] go upstairs your dad's coming home. in ten minutes and that was what i got to. talk about the birds. and the bees and that is beautiful. but anything i couldn't bring up. i would talk to. my brother about and you know. i assume my brother did the same. thing to me we never hated each other. you know i think he went through. some weird [ __ ] because i was the older brother. and just you know it's weird. when you growing up with an older. brother i feel like probably have to. like you know he did i did. everything first you know and then the the second kid. is like okay the second kid. we learned our mistakes and it's you. know it's like if you have 11. kids the 11th kid. is this like oh yeah what's his name. again you know so i feel like really cool. that my brother i feel lucky. that my brother directed it because he's great. first of all he's talented. but besides that i love him. and i genuinely love him deeply and to. have him a part of this experience helps me. you know i mean it. was that way with my dad. too it was the coolest. thing he was in he was in the van. i'm er when i shot my first special. he was in the van. with the headphones on and i knew out. there on stage he was proud of me. in that van you know. and i would think about that. while i was doing my special. while i was [ __ ] talking to. those people in new orleans and i got in my head. a little bit with stand. up through the years. like incorrigible i felt good about. and then i started getting a little bit insecure. because i didn't know what else to. talk about mana fire. was something that came out after encouraged. was my third special and the material. i had i loved but i just wasn't in a good. place in my life and my dad. directed it and it was great. i'm really proud of it. and i was still in my head. i shot comedians of the world. i really like the way. it came out i don't i'm lucky. to have what i have. and i'm lucky to. have shot what i have shot. in my career but man. but this special no pain. which is one of the reasons. why it's called no pain. because people always a pain. comedy comes from pain. but i didn't really [ __ ] experience much of that. in my life and i'm fortunate for that and i always used to. think that it was it. would make me insecure. as it made me insecure. that i didn't have that real [ __ ] to. talk about as a comedian. and and this one is just like [ __ ] all that i have what i haven't i'm really [ __ ] lucky and i'm really fortunate and i'm gonna talk about what the [ __ ] i'm gonna talk about and i'm like i have my dad i'm like i have my mom i'm like i have my own family you know and my brother directed it and that's a real [ __ ] special thing for me man and so you know thank you matt for doing it and you made it great you know it's cool to. have a support system i don't. know i don't know if that's what you wanted. to hear or not wanted. to hear i mean. sometimes i talk like that and then people end up [ __ ] being like [ __ ] you bro. because oh you don't know. what real pain is and it's like okay. but some people [ __ ] you know i look i'm just trying to. be honest with you guys. sometimes but yeah so i'm excited i'm really [ __ ] excited and thanks for to. everybody that ever has come out. to see me and [ __ ] supported me online or even if you haven't come out to see me if you just [ __ ] tell somebody i'm funny that's so cool and i appreciate that um what else that i wanted to talk about sorry i wanted to [ __ ] some serious [ __ ] there but i want to talk about something else that was funny what was it i have it right here the [ __ ] person who said that dessert is gay did you see this this [ __ ] chick tweets of course changed no i don't [ __ ] have it here we go a guy ordering dessert on a date is a red flag for me that's a female thing to do for real dis girl writes and then she writes if a guy is on a date with a woman the woman should be the only one asking for appetizers and dessert many meals in capital like seriously you can just taste some of whatever i ordered what the friggin [ __ ] is wrong with this girl you know to actually be like i liked it first of all i like that she has a heart opinion on appetizers that's my [ __ ] dude to have a hard opinion about nothing that's right in my [ __ ] wheelhouse but this checked and then she went on to say something like order two meals if you're extra hungry but don't get dessert imagine a girl be first of all since when is not since when is eating the most not what a man does i eat [ __ ] two meals i eat my meal scarf it down and i wait for my lady to finish that [ __ ] and when she doesn't i go oh yeah i'm like that guy in that yellow suit behind the tree meme oh yeah i'm like that guy bro that shit's going in my mouth when my lady does to me sometimes i'm out to dinner dinner it's like i'm a cleaning lady sometimes i'm out to dinner with my [ __ ] her in my opener or some [ __ ] and she's like you want to him and i'm like [ __ ] that's mine bro and i tell him i stopped it with him sometimes i say just so you know when she tries to offer you some [ __ ] it's not yours it's mine you understand me and he goes i'm always up to her and i said no it's not bro being a man is eating at all being a man is eating at all. it's like that old kenny loggins song. being the man who's eating at home. [ __ ] two meals and the certain appetizer. yeah but yeah dude. i like that she had a hard. description a hard opinion not description. very weird have a brain. tumor all good um and then people take it serious seriously you. know one day you will learn. that the only thing that that's gay. is homosexuality feminist traits and anal. kinks are not gay definitely not. eating dessert perhaps others. as well yeah all right. thanks for the [ __ ] break. live news week how many live do is we could this. just in no one day. you'll learn that only the only thing. that's gay is homosexuality feminine. traits and anal kinks are. not gay definitely not eating. dessert or appetizers as well. lmfao oh anal kinks are. not gay tonight at 11. our anal kinks gay tuning to. find out you can't wait till 11. our anal tinks gay dude. our a our anal kinks. gay or are they just sensational. sensational anal kinks you know. just say ass [ __ ] if a girl straps on a dick. and [ __ ] a guy in the ass that's not gay. straight up it's not gay. you're [ __ ] a girl it's not gay i know people be like you know the brothers like to. be like hey ya ain't gon. do that [ __ ] you know i mean but like bro. it's not gay you're [ __ ] a girl you're [ __ ] the girl with a strapon if a girl puts a strapon it.
