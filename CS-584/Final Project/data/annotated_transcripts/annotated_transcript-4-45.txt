working out almost vomited right. there but i was done. working out and then kristen was like i have a headache. can you get me. ibuprofen and i was like guess. i'm the butler but sure you know i guess i'm the butler but sure but i said yeah. sure and it's always under the sink in the bathroom. and she said you know. what there may not be any more. under the sink in the bathroom. but there but you may have. to use the uh ibuprofen. on the uh side table. of the bedroom on your side. and i go like this. okay and i'm already like it. better be in there and it better. be easy to. find because there's a bunch of [ __ ] in there because side tables on bed. and the sides of beds. always have like the most random [ __ ] in it you know you'll have like uh like your nighttime medicine. and like a book and also like a halfeaten. yogurt you know and um and a dead. cat and so i went to. look in there and there were nail. clippers there were books and there were a lot of things that would be in there and the things that i did not see were ibuprofen. but i did see tic. tacs so i thought you know. what it's not easy to. find she asked me. to do it guess i'm the butler now but guess what kind of butler i am i'm butler with jokes. right i'm the butler who's gonna be the butler that's also got a little bit he's got like a slight. sense of humor and uh i'm the prank. butler so i i took the tic tacs and i couldn't [ __ ] wait to. give them to her dude. and tell her it was ibuprofen. and i couldn't wait and i even filled. up water for i made it extra nice because your boy. was a jokester he's a bother. but he's a jokester. so i brought the uh tic tacs over. to her and she was on the couch. and i was standing up. and i handed them to. her and i couldn't wait you know. and i go here's the water. and i handed it to. her and she goes she looks at the tictacs. dude it couldn't have been funnier. she looked at the tic. tacs and then she stayed looking at it. for a while and i'm like my tummy's moving i'm like trying. not to laugh and then she just looks up. at me and she goes like this. and nothing could be funnier. and i started [ __ ] howling and she says why did you give me tic tacs and that was it dude. the day was over there are other things. that happened beyond that in the day. but that was when the day. ended because you can't get better. than that dude and we have fun. dude we're together and we have fun and we do silly. things that's the kind of silly. relationship that we're in um and then and then i said well it. wasn't she what the [ __ ] were you just gonna let me take take tic tacs and i was like well yeah and then i was probably gonna tell you later you know imagine people just swallowing tic tacs and not chewing them. dude like just how much would a f. a foreigner do that. thinking that it's like oh you just swallowed these. and and they remember breath. ashore do you guys remember. breath ashore i remember breath. ashore i thought that was the [ __ ] man. you would just put breath. ashore in your mouth and then drink it. and then it went out. of business or something. it's not around anymore. but you'd put it in your mouth. and then you'd drink the water. and then it would go in your mouth. and it would like sprout a [ __ ] nice smelling forest. in your belly and whenever you burped. it would smell like parsley and it. was just awesome you'd be at a party. just [ __ ] burping from the taco bell you ate in high school. and people be like what the [ __ ] is did somebody grow moss dude. it was the [ __ ] like what the [ __ ] does it smell. like a goddamn rain forest. in here for and you're like sorry. i had taco bell breath. is sure and then it just and then i was like you know. what i don't like chewing. gum so i'm just gonna get so many. breath of shores and then i went to. cvs i didn't have breath. of shores then i went to. rite aid they didn't have breath of shorts. i went to. save on drugs they didn't have breath. of shores and then that was when i realized that. there was no more [ __ ] breath to. shores if there's breath to. the two doors now i'm taking them. dude can't wait to. smell like parsley um just [ __ ] party smelling like parsley that's when you knew the real [ __ ] the the [ __ ] sober guy at the party. just burping burping up parsley just burping up. liquid parsley so gross. anyway uh she didn't take the tic. tacs and then i was like well i was just gonna see oh i also secretly kind of wanted. to see this is shitty. but i secretly wanted to. see um if she thought her headache. was gonna be better you know. because that's something about her that. she'll be like you know i don't even know actually. what i'm trying to say. here i also actually don't know. if maybe if i don't even talk about this. am i gonna am i in [ __ ] hot. water right now am i. gonna get in trouble. after this is she gonna be like you know. what you said in the podcast. wasn't cool um but anyway whatever i picked her up from that party. and she was super super high and uh and drunk. and all that so um what tuna story are you. talking about wonder what oh this. is exactly the point. dude [laughter] dude i uh i have such a weird. [ __ ] thing about people i always think they're lying and [ __ ] and uh she she all of a sudden was just like you know what sushi makes me have a stomachache and and i was like great. great great great a new thing. that you're just gonna fire. out there that you just say with no basis. because you had sushi probably twice. and now you want to. be the person who just can't says things. like i can't eat sushi. because it gives me. tummy eggs yeah dude. [ __ ] yeah we got another one we got another thing to. think of whoa and uh and so i'm like all right. cool and then of course doing the pandemic. i would be like man. can we get sugar. fresh sugar fish and she's just like make memory about my tummy. and i was like yeah yeah okay well i'm gonna get sugar. fish and she'd be like well then i have to. get a separate postmates and i'm like so and she's like yeah. but i just then it shows. up at different times and i'm like so. if you keep saying so to. somebody they realize they're wrong. even if they're right did you know that. that's something that you should. know it's windy out so hair all in your face. yeah well no i'm just saying so what yeah. no but it i guess. the you know the wind is. [ __ ] it's crazy. today so i don't know. it's not windy that's how that. conversation would go and so um so so so she um i'm like all. right [ __ ] i gotta i gotta not get [ __ ] sugarfish. now i forgot to. feel bad when i'm eating it. dude that nice buttery salmon i'm taking pieces. of buttery salmon and i'm just [ __ ] inserting them. into my mouth and having them dance. around my [ __ ] tongue and the flavors the flavor. is spectacular mexican the flavor. is spectacular and uh the flavor. is [ __ ] spectacular dude. you throw that [ __ ] that butter. soft [ __ ] salmon from sugarfish. into your mouth. and it just dances around. it's having a party it's going. from [ __ ] opposite member of the opposite. sex to member of the opposite. sex just trying to. [ __ ] get laid right. in your mouth dude that's what that. nice buttery salmon from uh sugarfish. is trying to do in your mouth. before you [ __ ] swallow it whole. right and uh so we got so now. i can't get it and i'm like well. let's just you know and so then a lot. of times i wasn't getting. it and then sometimes i would still get it. and she would order from something. else and they would come sometimes. at the same time two ubereats guys would show. up and just they'd be like they show. up at the same time. they'd be like hey well. i guess we're friends. now for the rest of our lives. and so um are you uber or are. you posting postmates oh i'm uber oh hey. how's it going just falling. in love oh that's funny. wow god it's crazy huh. so where are you where are you. are they're both getting their kias and just [ __ ] room. out and so so um [music] i i you know we had we had couples therapy once and and she was like why is it so you know i think we're talking about how i'm selfish and i was like how come i can't just get sugar. fish when i want to. get sugar fish and [ __ ] and then it came out that i was like i think that i think that she's not really being serious. about this the stomach this. dummy stuff i think she's actually like lying. you know what i mean. and the therapist said you think she's lying. about having a stomach ache and that. was when i realized i was an insane. person so there we go do it. we we live and we learn. we live and we learn. now is it my mom's fault. because when i was a kid. she would say stuff like that. i don't know i'm not saying. yes and i'm not saying no i hope she doesn't see this. podcast but um yeah dude. i don't know but uh you know. who knows what it's for. but then i was like [ __ ] why the [ __ ] would she lie about that because i get my i get in my in my head that people want to. be things so badly like they latch. onto things that they want because they it's like the thing. i made fun of on. tick tock that people are [ __ ] just being so mad at me. about about the the the stand. up i did with the with the working. out how you're not inspiring. anybody when they're and someone commented like working out. is not a personality and it's like that's how i feel like people are with stuff. and it goes right. down to um hey sushi gives me. a stomachache i'm like you're just trying to. [ __ ] have a personality not on my watch what a [ __ ] lightning rod of a piece of [ __ ] i am and uh like one time when i was this is this is i think this is when it started dude if i had to. [ __ ] think about a time when it started when i started to. think that people were were blowing. [ __ ] out of proportion because everybody's a conspiracy. theorist in their own head even. if you don't talk about it. if you eat sushi and you get a tummy. ache you're like that's from. the sushi i can't eat that. sushi anymore when this. is not necessarily true. right but i am not saying that. she was lying because she obviously was getting a a [ __ ] sushi for getting a stomachache right. every time so but what i am. saying is i remember the inception. of the moment that i started. thinking everybody was lying. and it was columbine. and i will explain okay. before you [ __ ] cancel me. again for bringing this up. it was columbine uh columbine. happened it was 1990. whatever it was and my and we were learning. about it on the kitchen. tv we had a kitchen. tv when i was in high school. and it was one of those tvs that was this. big and the image was this. big right so it looked like a [ __ ] toaster that you couldn't even put a full piece of bread. in and they will go like live. coming from live coming from coming. from colorado was that's where it was right. columbine is in colorado yeah live. coming from colorado there's children. you shoot shooting inside and my mom. was holding a notebook because she was doing something with a notebook and i and we both. saw the tv and we both. looked at the the stuff the news. and it was bad. right really bad and my mom. dropped the notebook in shock. and i don't think the moment. like here i am she drops. the notebook i'm like what who is. she [ __ ] kaiser jose at the end of the movie. just dropping the [ __ ] coffee. cup uh chaz pometeri dropping. the coffee cup just like like that. doesn't happen in real life. it's cinematic and so she drops. her notebook and i think the mo. i don't think that would have been the inception. except for the fact that the notebook hit my. foot and i wasn't wearing shoes. and it didn't hurt. a little bit it hurt. so much because like the end of the notebook bonked on. my foot and i go god. i go [ __ ] mom you dropped the [ __ ] notebook right and she was like oh shut the [ __ ] up and she walks over to. the tv and i'm just like dude. she didn't need to. drop the notebook she did that. for her this is how [ __ ] up i already was a 16 16 year old she did that. for her she did that. because she thinks life's. a movie like i made this is what i was thinking. and i always thought people thought that they were the leads in their own. movies and [ __ ] and that's why i made that stand up. and man on fire. about how like everybody. thinks they're denzel and then i realized who gives this. [ __ ] who cares about that who really honestly. gives a [ __ ] about that. that much if somebody thinks they're in a [ __ ] movie and they want to. be denzel washington walking into. making a deposit because of their [ __ ] uh paycheck from tender. greens who gives a [ __ ] it was adding so much. [ __ ] stress to. my life and shittiness and why the [ __ ] would i not trust somebody because they have a stomach ache from [ __ ] sushi so now we're better. people [ __ ] absolutely yes [ __ ] renner take me out still why don't my mom drop the no one you know what i mean but he's still got a little bit of he still got a little bit of it in himself. because it kind of makes him. him yeah dude keep the good. parts dispose of the bad parts. that goes from when you're cooking. chicken to working on yourself. oh man so i don't even. really know i didn't mean to. talk about this but that's but the tic tacs thing. was funny um i should have named my kid. blaze blaze dalia it's blaze and the monster. machine it's blaze and the monster machine but a lot of blazing the monster machines my kid watches. that and kristen always knows. all the words immediately to. all the theme songs. like how do you do that. she's like i just listen. and that's when i feel like a piece of [ __ ] it's plays in the monster. machines it's blaze and the [ __ ] monster machines every day. we blaze in the monster. machines every day we blaze talking. about weed um it's coke. and the monster machines it's cocaine. and the monster machines i [ __ ] don't like when they put those secret [ __ ] in the children's shows like remember when the little mermaid [ __ ] guy came out of the water. need a boner didn't. like it keep keep that. [ __ ] [ __ ] disney dude. it's plays and the monster. machine leans we take liberties. dude whenever anyone sings. and they do a few extra notes. they do i say oh taking liberties. and one time i left. the house and i had to. come back in to. get my keys and kristen. was singing a song and a holy [ __ ] [ __ ] she was taking so many liberties dude and i said taking liberties and she said oh i thought you left already dude and we have fun in our relationship. man i said dude.

what let me look it up because i can't remember his last name it was like mancini or some [ __ ] paulo uh 2020 i could get i got it 20 20 paulo mclarini i mean made up paolo maclarini this dude we watched this 2020 on it and 2020 kills it you know what i mean it was a regular day in 2008 and you're like it was wasn't it and you're just settling in you got your meal or your popcorn rebecca somebody met paulo uh went in for surgery it was a normal day blah blah and you're like it was normal wasn't it she was just getting surgery but but it's not but it wasn't normal for long and you're like you're right it was i could tell you know i could tell guy i could tell voiceover guy this woman [ __ ] met i can't believe you should watch it i guess but you know or i'll just tell you it but this guy paolo macchiarini was in uh was a guy who was a surgeon. and he was like a worldclass. surgeon and he made a trachea for people who whose trachea was [ __ ] up i'm very medical so that's why i'm talking about it. like this but if you had a broken ass trachea he made tracheas and would take your broken ass trachea out and just slide in a new one. and then you just pop. up and be like let's let's play. baseball or some or you know. let me eat up [ __ ] something you know what i mean. let me breathe regular and eat full meals. so this guy was this rock. star surgeon and he would just replace. your trachea dude just like it was nothing. like it was like wha like it. was literally like watching [ __ ] uh dennis the menace just that's how he did. it he was just like oh yeah. some people watch dennis the medicine. some people replace. dracus but he was a rock. star and he looked cool. they described him on 2020. like how he was like a little bit like george. clooney even though he wasn't sometimes. they get a little bit confident. with their [ __ ] he was just like george. clooney and if you look at him. and he's just like but he was handsome. and he was the [ __ ] he had a lot of money. and um they were doing a documentary. on him i think the lady worked for abc. or whatever and they were doing the the rock. star life of this paolo mac maclaren. machiarini and uh and she [ __ ] fell in love with him. because he's such a [ __ ] dope dude. he's like i replaced trey. it's like i mean like for real. man if you met a guy at a party. and you were like hey what's up. and he's like hey what's up. what do you do. she's like i just you know. i'm i [ __ ] anything i bag. groceries to oh i'm a [ __ ] news. correspondent or oh i'm i'm i'm a doctor even. if she's like i'm a doctor and then this guy's like that's cute. what do you do. i replace tracheas immediately. it's just oh i i had no i okay. would you like a drink and then you buy him. the drink you understand. and so she fell in love with him. and she was doing the story on him. and that's a nono. if you don't know anything about the journalist world. which i do it's a nono. you don't fall in love with. the subject of your [ __ ] thing right. so but she did because the guy was so he was just that. dope wasn't he and so um she said [ __ ] it i quit i want they they fell in love he asked. her to marry him. and he said that. there was going to. be a wedding and he's like listen. i gotta tell you something. i have a really high. profile uh clientele they pay. extra money and there's like this. whole it's like this whole society. and i i i work on them. and these people include barack. obama the pope. uh bro he said these people include barack. obama the pope. uh the clintons and also russell crowe that's what. he's that was the fourth. one which already he's like the politicians. and russell crowe and i'm like hell yeah. dude and i'm thinking does. russell crowe have one of these tracheas in him. so he said okay i got a meeting with the pope. and she was like wow amazing. and he comes back after the meeting and he says i got to. tell you something the pope's. going to marry us. and she goes what now here. i am now i know i'm watching the 2020. and obviously they're showing this. because this [ __ ] is an insane. person and either either he's lying or at the end. he kills a bunch. of people that's the only thing what happens. in the 2020s is either. he kills a bunch. of people or he up. he lied the whole time. and it wasn't who you thought he was and sometimes. it's both okay so she's like i'm sorry. the pope is gonna marry us. does he even do that. and he's like no but he's gonna do it. for us she's like what she tells the friends. and the friends are like what well i guess. it makes sense if he replaces tracheous and he's a rock. star they [ __ ] know and he works. with the obamas and [ __ ] so he says yeah our wedding is in spain. great or um our wedding. is in spain and it's in whatever. may if you're getting ready everyone. buys the tickets to. [ __ ] spain they all spend so many 300 people buy nonrefundable tickets to. spain and he uh they buy dresses and [ __ ] the bride's groom shits. and the bridesmaids and all this [ __ ] and two weeks to. the wedding they're gonna do it. in the church two weeks. into the wedding two weeks. to the wedding one. of the friends say to. this news reporter who fell. over them hey you know how like you said the pope. is gonna marry you. i mean dude this this woman. had like gay friends. and he was like i can't believe we're going. to get to go to. the wedding and the pope. is going to give us communion he said. hey the guy said hey you're going. to give all your gay. friends communion back then the the pope. you know catholicism didn't want. anything to do with gays. so the the gay guys. were like crying like i can't. believe it you know two. weeks before the wedding the friend calls. the [ __ ] news reporter lady. and he's like hey did you say they were gonna get married. the public got married. yeah the pope is scheduled to. be in south america in two weeks. and i'm like yeah okay because he's lying you know. and she's like what so she calls him. he says no they they [ __ ] it up somebody's trying to. go higher than the pope. and uh and and and and and they're using this. is strong i'm like who. the [ __ ] is higher. than the pope who is it. god is jesus just like hey you got to. be sorry i know you got to. marry this [ __ ] this trachea replacer guy but we got to. [ __ ] move you down to. south america we got to. be at south america for some [ __ ] function. so she's like she's like well that's weird. i'm going to call. the hotel just a kid. cause a hotel no record. of the hotel of the marriage. of the [ __ ] wedding parties close the restaurant for the rehearsal dinner and the thing no record no record of anything so she's like what the [ __ ] so she decides [ __ ] it i'm a reporter i'm gonna play cool i'm gonna be with the dude i'm not gonna show my cards but i'm gonna find out as much as i can hey what the [ __ ] is going on just run dude he's a liar just run and it turned out that this guy was falsifying credentials he somehow weasels his way in through school matrix the trach is turned out to. be just [ __ ] for real water. bottles that he would [ __ ] thin down. and put into. your throat and your skin. would grow over. it so 15 people [ __ ] died because this guy said he could replace. her tricia and it didn't work. dude so she showed up. to his [ __ ] house with the nonrefundable ticket at the end of the [ __ ] uh instead of going to. the wedding she showed up to. his house and he had another [ __ ] family of course because that's how this ends but my question. and my main question is hey guy don't you care. don't you have stress about all of this. cheating was hard enough cheating is so stressful but you're pretending that you're saving. people's lives replacing their tracheas and have. not one but two families. already the barcelona [ __ ] house he had a family and that wasn't his main even his main family dude. hey guy what were you. going to do when everyone showed. up for the wedding if nobody found out the pope. is going to be in south. america what the [ __ ] was your plan this. is the most amazing thing ever. and this is true. dude this isn't a movie that. stars chris evans probably you know. what i mean that that's the thing. he would take after he [ __ ] shot captain america. he's like you know what i'm tired. of these [ __ ] crazy roles let me play paulo macharini. the trachea replacement guy. still with his [ __ ] no matter what role chris evans ever. does i still want him. to have his captain america. [ __ ] shield on his back. that would be [ __ ] hilarious. dude but dude that's the kind of [ __ ] sociopath. if you're going to. be a sociopath. that's the kind you have to. be all out dude oh oh i don't oh i replaced. tracheas you do yeah you know the science oh yeah. i know it all and you don't and the people are gonna die. no they're not 15 die. uh it had to. do with something else honestly. they didn't keep up with their medical. plan afterwards really wait you have one extra family no. i have two i have two great. my dogs are barking so much it's unbelievable. hopefully we can't hear a minute. but if you can that's just the way. it goes man i [ __ ] cannot believe this guy paolo macchiarini wow why were there so many dogs barking dude for so long is it okay you think oh wow he says probably so he definitely knows he's not definitely knows it's not if you're barking dude i hate when my [ __ ] dogs bark man when my dogs bark how about this how do you feel when your dogs bark do you get angry i want to. know and i also want to. know if you had four dogs. and they were all barking. how do you feel dude. i get so blood curdling. man i get brm. i get [ __ ] blood red mad that's what i get it's chenzo that.
