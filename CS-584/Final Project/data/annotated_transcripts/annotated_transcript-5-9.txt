know. what really bummed me. out i was thinking about this today. the the this past week. like i was thinking about high school. i was thinking about i was about all. school not just high schools think. about my elementary schools about. high school i think about all. the things that i've done. in my life and i was thinking about them. fondly like i was thinking about like mostly like how it was fun. and then i thought about how i how did i feel though. when it was happening. and a lot of the time. i felt not happy. i felt like like in high school. it's a very awkward time. you know or you're growing. up you're like i wasn't i wasn't you. know i didn't i didn't feel. comfortable you didn't feel whatever. it was you felt out of place. and uh and i thought well that's interesting. that now i look back. on that fondly and it makes me. happy to think about that. time when in actuality it wasn't necessarily. it wasn't necessarily the happiest. of times right so i thought about how retrospect kind of like candy. coats everything and then i was thinking about all the things in my life. that i want to. do and i was getting excited for them. you know whatever it is having a family. doing my next next next netflix. special um you know. uh uh whatever it is lunch. even tomorrow oh i get to. have lunch tomorrow at that place. i like uh or i'm going. to las vegas in three weeks. i can't wait to. [ __ ] hang with my buddies. and try to. [ __ ] up jump the buggy you know and i was ex. and i was thinking about all the things i was excited about and then i was thinking. about doing all of those. things like think about going. to vegas with your friends. think about getting to. do that think about if next week. you and your buddies got to. go to las vegas. without your wife without your girlfriends. or if you don't have one. it doesn't matter maybe you're gonna go. plucking and up jump. the boogie with your friends. okay you'd be so [ __ ] excited wouldn't you you'd be so excited to. just go let off some steam now. what we know is if you're over. 30 it wouldn't be as good as you made it out. what you thought it was going. to be because that's what happens. you go [ __ ] yeah let's do this and you go and you get to. the [ __ ] club in vegas or whatever it is you're like oh it's okay or you go to. the strip club and you're like oh i thought it. was maybe i was gonna [ __ ] meet a chick and maybe i was gonna start dating a stripper and it didn't happen. you let your fantasy go. run wild but that's what keeps you going. help my point is is it's never as good as you think it's going. to be and retrospect candy. coats everything so that means the worst. time is now that sucks dude. if if looking back on. things that weren't necessarily good. make it better and if you're excited for something. that's not going to be. as exciting as you. think it is then the worst. time is now and that's all you ever. have now we're [ __ ] see ya all good we're [ __ ] let's all live in it together it sucks the most now it sucks the most now i can't i can't stop it i can't i can't even stop it i'm pissed yes i always want the [ __ ] thing to. be a kill switch and it's not yes i always want to. [ __ ] start something when i hit the key. and then have it be a kill switch. [ __ ] yes and it never is yes it just starts to. fall over the [ __ ] song over again yes it'd be much funnier. to cut it out but one fire. doesn't set up that way. and i always tell them. to [ __ ] yes boy yeah yeah um yeah so that's it that was the profound thought i had today at least you get to. look forward to things. that won't be that good you know. what i'm talking about but sometimes. this [ __ ] surprised you right when the ship pops off when you really do up jump the boogie right but it's never when you expect it though remember those times you were just driving around in the valley with your old roommate and [ __ ] and you were like yeah whatever and then something happened uh like a you know like some cool [ __ ] happened and you were just like whoa [ __ ] yeah dude i didn't know that that was gonna be awesome and then it happened then it's all good actually that guy i remember my old roommate i my old roommate and his buddy who i'm still friends with uh now he now now his buddy is one of my [ __ ] really really good friends you know how that always happens you're like you think you have a friend and then you meet their friend and then you guys get closer and you're like oh that's the real friend anyway so i met that guy and we still keep in touch you know i still can't touch the other guy too but uh i used to. do this thing with like waiters and [ __ ] or anytime someone would give you something like if you were like at a [ __ ] mail place and they were that you were to. mail something and they give you a receipt or whatever i used to. i used to. do this thing for me. this is how [ __ ] dorky i am instead of saying thanks man. i'd say i'd say i'd say i'd say xmen but i would do it. and they would never no they would never you know. they'd never catch on because either there's two things. that were going to. happen they're either not going to. hear it because they're so ready. to hear thanks man. so i say xmen and they think or or so they either. think they either just hear thanks. man or they hear. me say xmen and they think well he obviously didn't say. xmen i misheard it so i'll just let it go. so we were at this. restaurant house of pies. in uh on in [ __ ] hollywood you know. and i was telling my buddies. about this how i say xmen sometimes and it's funny. for me and he was like really and i said yeah. i said guys come by and they would drop the food. off and say oh xmen and they say no. problem because i'm [ __ ] obviously not in their head saying xmen but so my buddy mitchell is like oh all right i'm going. to try it i was like alright cool. and i was like but listen. you can't say [ __ ] xmen like it's thanks. man like you can't be like thanks. man like that's [ __ ] you gotta [ __ ] say xmen you don't have to. be like xmen but you got to. be like thanks man you'll be like xmen so the waiter. drops the food off and my buddy says xmen and the waiter. says did you say xmen [laughter]. bro i don't know if there's ever been anything. funnier that's happened like i have been doing. it for years nobody's ever and he just goes xmen and the waiter. says did you say xmen oh for [ __ ] sake man. and he was like oh no. i don't know imagine just saying xmen to. nobody you'd be like this. what what this was the [ __ ] losing it's also even better. because like the xmen movies weren't. even like popping yet like it was just like a thing. that dorks would know. about it wasn't like marvel was so big. he's just [ __ ] xmen for no reason. when he gets a [ __ ] waffle oh [ __ ] dude i love [ __ ] like that man i love [ __ ] like that oh [ __ ] i was had my hands like in my [ __ ] with my [ __ ] knees together rolling around on that [ __ ] pleather booth okay ah [ __ ] oh [ __ ] man farmer's dog dog food

was like all good. i'll just be the guy i am. love love keith murray. love all the love allah rap. is the only you know. what i think hurts rap. rap is the only uh genre of music. where there's uh old school. why do you label. it that know what i mean. if you didn't label it. that then the guys who were old. school would still be they could still be relevant. but the second you say they're old school. it makes them not relevant. anymore like i'm sorry but eric sermon [ __ ] rips a lot of you young guys don't know what the [ __ ] that is like if you play fortnite you probably don't know who eric sermon is but he rips like i guess jayz would be old school but he's he's still kind of he still makes music that [ __ ] kind of rips i guess jump out like yeah who the [ __ ] you wit jumped out like yeah who the [ __ ] you're with um yeah so [music] i don't know if uh yeah video game i guess they're gonna start building stadiums for video games which is which is wild you know think about like the actual people in the stadium watching the fortnite world cup i would i would argue there's never been a more a bigger group of unathletic people in a stadium than in that moment these guys

booga could take it away but you know it's like 1.8 million for second place that's not too shabby like you know that's the thing like oh you know if i played video games and someone was like oh [ __ ] you're a dork i'd be like you god damn right i am you are god damn right i am name calling is the [ __ ] somebody wrote me on uh instagram about my tattoo and he was like your tattoo sucks. this and that or i don't. you know i remember exactly. what he said he's like you don't get it. on your hand the first tattoo you're trying. too hard and i was like oh yeah he was like that's i guess. you're trying to keep 16. year old girls liking you. or something and i was like why. are you so concerned you. know i had to do a [ __ ] clap back. i had to [ __ ] send him to. denny's it's all good but he [ __ ] ordered you know he sat down at denny's so i had the grand slam. and i said why are you so concerned with 16. year old girls you [ __ ] pedophile i said also you're fat because i looked at his profile and he was [ __ ] hefty and he said oh so you're just gonna name call bro you don't get to. do that man you walked in this. denny's this is what we serve you don't you. don't do i can't help. it you wanted to. [ __ ] i can't help it that you can't go back in time. and erase the beginnings of the but you can't. dude are you do you have a phone. booth that goes back in time. that sprays purple and green. mist if you do then go ahead and try to. delete the but you can't because those don't exist. yet so why is your nose. facing my nose wow. what am i ever talking about. you know how sometimes people are like you know. how people are like uh there was there's something that there's something. it's called something where you feel. like you're a fraud in your career. yes imposter syndrome i just. found out what imposter syndrome. is and and i was talking about it. and then and then i looked it. up and it's it's whenever it's when you feel you're bringing. up it's when you feel like you're you're you're an imposter. even though you're really doing what you're doing. imposter syndrome is also known. as uh is a psychological pattern in which an individual. doubts their accomplishment and has a persistent. internalized fear of being exposed as a fraud. and i was despite external evidence. of their competence the the those experiencing this. phenomenon remain convinced at their frauds and it was like how like almost everybody. has it and i was like i never felt that. way and i thought oh am i a sociopath. like dude if someone were to. be like like wha i don't get it. i'm put um yeah i don't know. some of it seems like normal. [ __ ] like fear of failure i. guess being a comedian is [ __ ] different though. you you you subject yourself. to so much [ __ ] hate and like possible. like scrutiny because you're just standing in front. of you know like the other night. i had to follow leslie. jones who literally i mean. nobody kills harder. than her you know. she's in ghostbusters and [ __ ] and she's on snl. and i was like [ __ ] i gotta follow. leslie tonight and i looked. and i walked in and she she was doing like 35. she runs the light all. the time and i was like okay. the more someone does time. the harder it is you know. if you do 15 minutes. it's fine but she did. 35 minutes and i was like dude. this is so so annoying how long she's doing and and i was like oh i'm still gonna go. up you know and i was like [ __ ] i'm just gonna eat [ __ ] who gives a [ __ ] like who cares because i've eaten [ __ ] before and i peeked my head in while she was on stage and she was screaming. in the face of someone in the front. row and she was saying do you have cocaine. and everyone was they weren't even laughing. they were howling it was like a sermon and i was like i'm gonna eat [ __ ] when i go up. there and she got off stage and i went upstage. and i killed i didn't eat [ __ ] but like you know i don't know where i was going i wasn't trying to. brag for sure um [music]. my point was something else i guess. being a comedian yeah you just don't give a [ __ ] you have to. not give a [ __ ] because if i were to. go up on stage after her and you could sense. that i give a [ __ ] then you wouldn't laugh. because i always say that. like when a comedian bombs a comedian. doesn't truly bomb this. is what i have always said. since i've done stand. up a comedian doesn't truly bomb. unless the unless the comedian cares that he's bombing. if a comedian doesn't care that he's bombing. it he's not bombing. because the audience can smell. that and they're like ah he [ __ ] he knows. it's funny but he he's just having a rough. night who cares. but the second the comedian. does a [ __ ] nervous laugh. or a swallow or like i don't know i guess. i thought that was funny. then you're bombing dude. you're out in the middle. of the ocean you know. but if you don't care it. doesn't matter diddle and then [music]. anyway get your [ __ ] no dents slides these are the [ __ ] dude they really are you know or if you have dents you can just get one and hop around on the left foot if you want to. do some uh uh questions or you want to. do some um what do you call. it uh also do we have misconnections. or no we should do next. time we're in albuquerque we do albuquerque. miss connections have you ever. done that we have oh we did. okay cool i don't remember anything. that's great cool cool cool i'm gonna have a dementia. when i get older oh that's cool. oh i should do more. sudoku oh cool that's what they say. helps it my [ __ ] you know frank. at washed frank k. possible change it although maybe there's meaning behind it. accuracy hey chris why are your forearms. so smooth yeah you know. what sometimes people ask. me if i shave my forearms i've never shaved. my forearms in my life. i've never had electrolysis i just [ __ ] i just look. [ __ ] good dude my forearms are just smooth. as [ __ ] man i have hair little hairs on there you know it's on there you know i guess i guess i'm lucky because you can see the striations now in my [ __ ] muscles you'd be like oh that guy obviously uses kettlebells like what the [ __ ] because you know i don't know but they're goddamn smooth man i'm living it up while i still can man cause maybe when i'm 60 i'll start getting hairy or some [ __ ] yeah i don't know i have smooth skin i have real smooth skin for real like when when when people touch my back they're like what's going on dude besides the fact that they're like oh this is obviously where they shot lord of the rings because it's so mountainous they go oh but why is it so why is it so smooth and i go that's when i look at them and i say anointed one and they go yeah maybe but yeah you know so yeah i'm smooth as [ __ ] my hands bro if you were to. hold my hand like we were at a park. you'd go huh is that. butter all right next question. i'm just smooth as [ __ ] bro. washed frank hey crystalia how would you fight someone if they had called you that oh wait oh imagine this is a meme imagine living in the 70s. and having to. fight another man because he called you a jive turkey jive turkey uh hey hey crystal how would you fight someone if they had to. call you that we know how you like coming. up with the fake fight scenarios. oh yeah i do do that. huh hmm i'd probably just carry. around a [ __ ] whip or a gun or a [ __ ] or a poison and try to. shove it in their mouth. i don't know i don't care. you know who cares. if someone calls me a name it. doesn't matter to. me you know what i mean. that's the whole thing what i'm going. back to on the on the you own. it you know how [ __ ] is it to. try and catch a fly with your hand. it's actually literally i mean. sometimes it's you know how we say in this. pocket it's all a circumstance. circle that could literally be the least. [ __ ] thing you could do if you do it like if you're just chilling in a sk and a fly goes bam and you catch it that's not [ __ ] but if you're like [ __ ] about it it could be [ __ ] yeah that's not really that [ __ ] like getting into. a car what was the guy. who said getting out. of the car backwards or something. that was so big getting. what was it yeah getting out. of the back seat of a twoseater oh yeah. that's so [ __ ] like there's no way to. do that cool even if you have sunglasses. on um that's funny is there. another one or no whatever. at least my back hurts uh and stop giving me advice. about about it you know. when i say stuff like on. my back hurts on the podcast. i i get like [ __ ] nine dms a day. where it's like well if you're really. [ __ ] why don't you just yeah no you know are you a fan of mine. then you know i'm not to. listen to you let my back. hurt so i could just chill. you know it is it is i'm looking at um i'm looking at [ __ ] my email right. now because i'm being respectful. on you [ __ ] and guess what i got an offer to. do um a casino here wow. that's pretty good what it's bad. to do uncouth. um where is it near. san francisco when is it. oh oh it's in april. okay cool yeah that's way. too far sure why not look how i do. it to my agent. sure why not in all caps. and then i'm gonna write i'm the [ __ ] [ __ ] baby i'm the [ __ ] [ __ ] baby they would that's what i did sent it to. my agents look to. prove it that's how we do it. dude you gotta give a [ __ ] less in your life. oh they just responded they don't want me. um yeah dude [ __ ] yeah man life's good baby life's. as good as you. make it so make it good. i'm gonna be the mayor. i like bootage is that how you say. it that guy just seems really like you know. i don't know i'm not political. it's just like how about the lady. that's like a hippie she's just like they're like how do you think we could beat donald. trump and she's like love. and cookies who's that lady you don't even. know what i'm talking about the one. with the beaker on the side. of her mouth i call it. a beaker man did i talk about this. on the podcast i would call beauty marks beakers. when i was a kid. my mom mama i did. it like it was a word. that existed madonna it was. probably how or cindy crawford. i be like she'd be like she's beautiful. i like my yeah but i don't like her. beaker and my mom's like what. the [ __ ] are you talking about what's a beaker and i was like the thing on the side. of her mouth and she's like that's a beauty mark and i just called. it a beaker and i think that that's what it. i thought that's what it. should have been called and i just said it. like that's what it should have. been called and so i call them. beakers that's what it should. be called yeah what's her name. marianne williamson i always like the candidates. that are like running. that are just like obviously not. gonna [ __ ] make it like just give up i guess. it's like like remember when that guy. used to run. for the green or the independent. was his name no um yeah him. but yeah nader dude. that guy would [ __ ] everything up like just dude stop bro like no but it's good for the party. ah also what an annoying. last name nader nader. sounds like some [ __ ] [ __ ] that would be around in the 90s. like uh that i don't know. what i'm saying it doesn't matter. who cares but he [ __ ] [ __ ] up pete buddha judge he he's just like succinct and cool and like no [ __ ] here's one of the reasons why i i want him to. be the nominee because i think him arguing. with trump would be the funniest i think he would. have so many [ __ ] slams and obviously trump. has so many slams just because he will literally call. somebody like duty head but like he would just i think that's the guy. to uh scare that would scare trump. out of all the guys because it's just he's so young. he's gay you know. trump would probably be like i don't want to. say i mean even though. he does doesn't give a [ __ ] what he says he would he would be like i can't make fun of gay. you know like they're just it. just feels like a land. mine for trump buddha judge so. i want him to. be the guy now so far. um i don't know if he'd win it'd be cool. to have a gay. president it would be [ __ ] awesome to. have a gay president. i i don't i don't know if america. would be ready to. vote for one like i don't know there's so many [ __ ] prejudice people out there but i didn't think obama was gonna get it and he did and that surprised me and that was really cool um but yeah dude if we had a gay present that would be the [ __ ] just principle of it you know um oh wow trump calls pete but alfred newman that's kind of funny. actually that's the thing about trump. man i mean he's funny. you know he is funny. like you can hate him. all you want but he's funny. and that's that's almost like sucks. because it's like that's people like him. because of that um anyway i
