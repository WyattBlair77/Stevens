night in new jersey. and if i know that this is all i got then that's as long. as i can stay but if i'm going. on a tenday vacation and that's what i got by. the way a tenday vacation. is way worse than going. for two days of work because i don't want to. be i don't to. be relaxing that long i can't. do it do it iii dude. i was thinking about i don't i don't somebody asked me. the other day on

[ __ ] and it was raining it thundered a little foetus or i don't know. it a thunderstorm out of nowhere. in the sky you know. what albuquerque does right for real the sky. and you know i've lived in like new. jersey i lived in la. and there's thunderstorms in new jersey. but dude in albuquerque it's like it'll you'll see that lightning that it's like really far. away and it'll just like light up. the whole sky and then it'll crap. and then and then it'll [ __ ] illuminate from the ground. it's amazing dude the clouds. they got our different clouds. man i know it's the same. clouds you see but they're. different clouds dude the la. skies terrible that likes guys terrible. it's all smoggy and [ __ ] but what have i done. i i was in we've been shooting shotguns. for the for the first time i shot a pistol and an m4 i think that was what it. was that was what the navy seals guys. were telling me the first day. i was just like so it's weird. to pick up like a killing. machine you know like something that's made for killing. that's what was in my head. and then the second day. i was like i felt like ron. wick i felt like i was like john wicks brother. i was like i got this [ __ ] well the the [ __ ] the empty rounds. will fly out and hit your face. and that shit's hot. like summer on your face. do um and that's like you know. i was just thinking about like okay. like you hit targets first. of all we don't have to. hit targets cuz we're in a movie you know what i'm talking. about so you're doing that. and you got the gun and then you and then and then you got it and then yeah it doesn't really matter. and the first time i was doing i was like trying. hit the target and i was like oh i don't need to. hit the [ __ ] target it'll. cut and i'll hit the target. it'll edit it into. me hitting the car i was like i got a concentrate just on like drawing. and [ __ ] like that and so i was draw so i would i would do that and i would fire. it and i don't know where i was going. with this but uh so i really was trying. to do my [ __ ] i don't know do you know what it actually has been happening i've been looking at my [ __ ] phone too long and it makes my brain dead it makes my brain like do it before phones i would think of stuff in the world like i'd be like oh this is like that that's like this it would make me funny right now i just stare at [ __ ] instagram or twitter or whatever and i just feel like a piece of [ __ ] well my apps not working i think technical difficulties let me let me start it over the app just the app maybe this works yeah but i don't know but like i used to. think of [ __ ] phones [ __ ] me up i used to. think of [ __ ] and now i don't think of [ __ ] like i was just as starbucks and i i noticed something. that was funny at starbucks. starbucks like when i was at starbucks. this dude these two dudes walk. in and there were s albuquerque. like one guy came in and had like tattoos all over. and it was real skinny. if you're skinny and you got tattoos all over. here from albuquerque and so he was like he was chillin. with his other buddy. and his other brother. but he looked like him. if he was on if he was on like a workout plan like he's a little healthier. that they were sitting down and i wasn't looking behind. me but they were talking and and all i kept hearing. was this dude who was like a a dog. a dog if of all the other guys name. was chris so gay. chris he's like they'd take a picture. they take a picture i mean. dog and then chris took a better. just in chris leg like that. and then the guy was like nah. man come on man. i don't like a picture like that. and he was like take it. take a different picture of me. dawg and chris was like nah bro. you got to do. it like this he was like nah. dawg they took another picture say hey man come on man. don't take a picture like that. i hate pictures like that. that's what he was saying. and i was like what the [ __ ] kind of pictures. would like how they were in a starbucks. like what kind of [ __ ] picture is he taking i wanted to. turn around so bad but i didn't want. them to be like eh. what the [ __ ] are you looking at bro. you're not from here so and i was like thinking about how that. was funny you know and i was like ah dude. i could maybe make a bit about that. and then i just started looking at my phone. forgot no bit there will be no. bit about that not. even on my podcast i'm talking. about on stage. that's not gonna be new material. now because a [ __ ] instagram is not working that's annoying. i have this app that works. some a lot and they just [ __ ] keep [ __ ] it up they keep [ __ ] texting me and [ __ ] whatever it doesn't matter so now i don't know and also i also i was in the same starbucks. and this guy comes up. to me he's like hey man. i really like your hair. and as i god thanks and he says yeah. i always wanted curly. hair like that and i said oh yeah. and he said yeah guy had long [ __ ] johnny. depp here that was like silver. and [ __ ] and then just walked out didn't even get a coffee. it's like he came to. just look for somebody with cool. hair and then [ __ ] walked out walked into. starbucks was homeless maybe not maybe people are homeless. or maybe they're from albuquerque. i don't know you know. and went to some you know. local restaurants and [ __ ] and no matter what i do it's like the wrong. thing like i'll post. something i'll make in front of [ __ ] i'm making fun. of [ __ ] on my instagram and then somebody will write me oh bro. you're not even go to. the right place man you make fun. albuquerque but there's a lot of cool. places and i'll go to. another place and then sorry oh you gotta go. to this other place. then i go to. that place nah bro you gotta cut the [ __ ] up i'll just do whatever you know it'll be fine a place is cool it's not cool if you're there for two weeks and you're bored of [ __ ] then that's how it is hopefully this doesn't make the news but it's fine dude it's not it's not it's not bad it's not a bad place it's actually the people are really nice and know you know what's really cool about albuquerque is they don't [ __ ] bother you too much like people aren't in your face like everywhere else i go there more in there more like like dude i'll tell you what in albuquerque i'm the least famous guy nobody nobody can i get a picture so only a very very rarely everywhere else i go can i get a picture tiger picture maybe it's the news thing maybe they're [ __ ] try to. boycott me i don't know but um yeah i don't know albuquerque is a lot of mud huts and it's got this own like new mexico's got like it's so weird how it goes over like from the eat from the west coast california the style of california is just kind of whatever just doesn't really have crazy style then you get over to. [ __ ] like arizona and it's got this obvious kind of like sort of like i guess like like i don't even have to. scar like this aztec e'en. indian type [ __ ] style and then you get over to. new mexico and it's like you're just there pretty much it's like got this like mexican. sort of like really like there's no mistaking. this artwork and it now it's pretty. it's always a just like tan. and [ __ ] brown and [ __ ] and then you see that sun with the with the [ __ ] like the thing on the like slate. that [ __ ] is everywhere. like the albuquerque symbol i've never seen. a symbol more in a place. than albuquerque people have it on the back. of their neck they get a tattooed dude. albuquerque here's the other thing too and i'm and i'm not even knocking it. but you guys oh my buddy. on the on the on the show on. that we're doing omari hardwick. he's on power he's on. this movie he got a [ __ ] dope tattoo i might go to. the tattoo place but most of the tattoos in the albuquerque. you look like you were just bored. and went to go. get the tattoo and were like yeah okay. i guess and so many albuquerque. sons with the [ __ ] what he called it on the same thing. on the license plate. but anyway and then after santa. santa fe after new mexico. what's after new mexico. [ __ ] texas what's to. the east that's it. and then it's like kind of gone. it's sort of gone i mean. texas is kind of more. cowboy [ __ ] and then it's gone after texas is just like there's no like i guess it's in fluid from mexico. i guess i don't know i could google. it but i'm not gonna you know. so just that's how it is we learned. um so yeah i went to. the starbucks i don't know starbucks. still tastes like a [ __ ] back of a cow's. mouth i've had some other cool. coffee shops that are cool. but also they're not that. good people are like you got to. go this when i go to. that one it's not that. good also what's up. with like [ __ ] if it's not painted brown it's painted white and it's so sunny that i needed to. get glasses i got these [ __ ] sunglasses from sunglass hut i drove to. the mall to do it and i was like i got it. i give up i was like i literally like i was i was like i give up. dude i [ __ ] it's too bright. i got to albuquerque. i was like it doesn't really matter. i don't need to. get sunglasses i could just walk around. my opener never has sunglasses he's always just kind of squinting. i was like i could do it. bro is brighter here did. you know that it's [ __ ] brighter here. so i had to. go to the mall okay by the way. go to this mall every other store. is a shoe store. now here's the deal every other stores this. shoe store but also i walk. in as soon as i go. there's a walk in there's a kiosk of sunglass. hut so it's like okay. cool so i say hey man. do you have any like ray bans. those are the kinds i like i was like i'm just gonna [ __ ] get it and he was like ah we don't have the kind you want he said i said oh but aren't there other isn't there. like another sunglass hut here in the mall. and it goes like this. there's four hat hey there's four sunglass. huts in the [ __ ] mall in albuquerque. in the coronado mall. you don't need for you. need one just take the [ __ ] kiosks out and put them all in the one goddamn one you can seriously do that. economy of glasses economy of lenses. put the [ __ ] glasses in the kiosk. why am i peeking. i'm peeking oh i'm peeking. put the sunglass yeah okay. that's better ha i guess it sounds like maybe i'm it's gonna be a rough one so that's what it. is here you want to. hear it you got a good. news for me why. okay alright anyway uh we did we went to. sunglass hut i went to. sunglass hut by myself and i got the [ __ ] glasses and it's all good this is so [ __ ] boring what am i doing here i don't i don't you know what though i just feel like you're you know some pod casts are gonna be good and some are gonna be [ __ ] boring i listen to. i listen to. some other guy some other podcasts. and by the way i listen. to some other podcasts. and they're [ __ ] boring as [ __ ] too except for some of them are [ __ ] really interesting this one will never be really interesting it'll just be kind of funny sometimes how about the lady that [ __ ] drove through the the jackinthebox thing or whatever it was and and and they said hey it'll be [ __ ] 1950 or whatever and she said this one's on god and she drove away did you hear about that yeah she goes this one's on god like gods paying for it hey going to. hell hey you're going. to hell dude that's the first person. should that should be in line. for hell you can't use god. to get free [ __ ] burgers. i'm gonna do that but so many people hit. me up too cuz the last episode. was called [ __ ] take it up with christ. people were like ah she shoulda said take it up. with christ this one's on god. you could say that right. when you bust nuts. this one's on god. [ __ ] whatever dude i wake up every time i wake up in albuquerque. my nose is so dry and i go. to the bathroom to. get tissues this is how dumb i am. dude every morning i wake up. at like whenever before. you really wake up you know. how you wake up. you do the pre wake up. before you really wake up. which is annoying as [ __ ] your body just can't stay awake for eight. hours who sleeps for eight. hours straight i've done. that maybe if i take a nyquil. but like i'll sleep. and then wake up and then sleep. and then wake up and when i wake up. my nose is drier than the sahara. okay so then i'll get up. and every time i think man. i really should just bring the tissues. over to the bedroom to. the bed i go. i get the tissues i blow. my nose and i don't burn. anything now i'll just it'll be fine. and then i go back. in bed and then i don't bring the [ __ ] tissues. and then i wake up again. in an hour and i think i really gotta bring these tissues. back and then i don't and i go to. the [ __ ] bathroom and then i come back. and i'm doing [ __ ] calisthenics and when i can just be [ __ ] grabbing the tissue and blow my nose and i don't do that [ __ ] i don't know what it is it's like i don't want to. succeed in my life when it comes to. [ __ ] normal [ __ ] i want it to. make it the hardest. way possible and i don't know why. maybe it's cuz my life. is easier good but i [ __ ] uh you know it's so dried that i have to. blow my nose i have to. do a few blow nose. blows before i actually get the [ __ ] out. you know what i'm talking. about and it's horrible. and then i take all the tissues. and i throw them on. the so i did it. last night i brought that. didn't thing the tissue box. and i brought the tissues. and i would blow my nose. and i put it next. to my bed i just drop them. there and then they i was like i gotta clean this. up because it looks like i [ __ ] jerked off and i just had the tissues. next to my bed. no cleaning these good. oh so sorry you jerked off. also at the hotel i'm staying at they [ __ ] knock on the door. before 9 a.m. to. clean the room what the [ __ ] who am i steve. jobs i'm not waking up. then with a [ __ ] wakes up at before and in a hotel is what i'm saying like in your daily life. get you gotta wake up. at [ __ ] 7:00 sometimes or 6:00 to. work out and then go to. work but in a hotel. dude start the [ __ ] at 10:30. that's it start at 10:30. make sure everyone's out and it's also annoying. because when i [ __ ] wake up but i go and i open the door i'm like hey and i'm like y'all. i'm still sleeping or like okay. as like but come back later. and then they don't it's like well [ __ ] you if you're not gonna if you're gonna burn daylight you don't get your room. cleaned and then i went downstairs. and i was like hey i need more body wash it. give you like a little [ __ ] ass symbol. of it you know. hotels cuz they don't want you. to it's like they don't want. you to waste it but it's more. like they don't want you. to use it they're like god. will give them a little bit. and it's almost not enough. for my whole body you know. my [ __ ] mountain ride got a mountain range on my back. how the [ __ ] am i supposed. to wash these this [ __ ] jim saying i've got shoulders that go on until next thursday and you want me to. wash with a little thimble. what why i'm sorry. but what and so i went down. i said hey can i get some body. wash and i go like this. i look at the front desk. and i go like this. because i'm a gesture to. my [ __ ] mountain range and she's like sure and then when i got up next time i got up there was a [ __ ] bag of them like a [ __ ] you bag did i love that [ __ ] man loving it loving it but as hot as [ __ ] you know did you see [ __ ] army hammer how he let his kid suck his toe and everyone went nuts thought it was armageddon dude i don't care it doesn't matter i couldn't believe it is it this by the way is it like do people think that like suck it on a toe is a sexual thing i it was that what it was it was like four seconds the kid was just sucking on army hammers till he see his own kid and he was like he's been doing this for like an hour obviously joking and the internet flipped out dude his name was trending over 6,000 times you know what i did i followed him i'm [ __ ] instagram cuz that's what you get you get a follow dude that shit's funny as hell what is it cuz it's a sexual thing dude if my kid sucks. my toe i go what the [ __ ] are you doing and i film it that's what i do i'm team. army hammer bro so i followed him on instagram. because that's what you get when you're a [ __ ] pro on instagram he's a pro on instagram filming. some [ __ ] and daily life that people want to. say people were like oh no i'm so bummed i looked at it. it's so gross. no it's not dude. ab although i think that here's the thing. if you think it's gross. you think of feed as. a sexual thing cuz why is it. gross who cares what if the kid. was sucking on his finger. what's the difference it. doesn't matter it's [ __ ] toast dude. and i got a buddy who's that. got like a foot fetish. like a serious one and that's weirdest [ __ ] he's a big comedian and he loves feet. and i would never tell you who that. is cuz i'm cuz i'm loyal. but it i'll tell you why. it's not one of those stories that. ends with and that man. is me it's not me. i don't get it and then also some people are like ill. feet like go [ __ ] yourself look down you got him but this guy loves feet you ever see like feet jobs on the internet like you ever watch more than 2 seconds of it you know how hard it is it's harder to. rent the [ __ ] car you're like or it's harder than renting a car. you let there like like this. you know don't use anything to. jerk anything off unless it's got a thumb with it [ __ ] knees all out. and [ __ ] so not sexy girlf joking you off. with feet hey yeah if you can't use one then it doesn't work you know you gotta use both because you don't have thumbs. that's weird although i would like to. be in a feet though. it would be cool. to be in two feet. sexually because then you could be like oh i got another thing. that's like people like i wish i was in the feet. it's weird but like i wish i had more things. i was into sexually. i got pretty much regular [ __ ] like i like to. be kind of dominant but then also that's pretty much. it you do three positions. i've been over this dude. you do missionary you do doggy. style and then you do the girl on top. but you don't do also if you're a guy on guy. i'm you know i've never done. guy on guy i'm not gay. but like if i kind of wish i was so i can make those rules. too because if i make those rules. as a straight man people gonna get mad. but here's the rules. anyway okay get mad if you want you only do doggy. that's it you don't do it. you don't face each other. until i was about thirty i didn't think about like i thought like oh you just do regular you. just do doggy gay. guys just do doggy but i was like you. don't have to. i go [ __ ] you could do like face to. face but then it but then you're having sex. with the guy and the other guys. the other guy's looking at you. it unplugged and then the other guys. it's okay it unplugged that thing. and then the other guys looking at you but then he but then his his dick. is flopping all around. you know i didn't think about the other guy's dick. when you're having sex it's okay. it just went a little quieter. that's all what am i keeping going. yeah i can hear myself. i never thought about the other guy's dick. in gay sex do you know. i'm saying you have a home. for your penis if you're the giver but the other guy's penis. is kind of more like like he's looking. for a gate at the airport i'm saying you've never thought about that. if you're a straight dude you don't really. think about this stuff but i do because you have to. i think i have to. think about all the things to. make all the rules. the other guy's dick is. looking for a gate. at the airport that's what he's doing. and then if he's his turn to. give he's like up found we're boarding. and the other guys like i've arrived at my destination. i wish i was into. all the stuff i wish. i was gay i wish i was well. as long as it's legal. you're not i'm talking about the more the better. dude the more busting. the better right that's how it is that's my mayor. platform running for mayor platform. that's my pet phone run. for mayor that we had these navy guy. maybe seals training us to. how to shoot. the guns and [ __ ] i'd always try to. like make people laugh like that's my thing. like to like you know. i feel like like in my head. it's like breaking someone. like if i can make them laugh. then it's like okay good then we're good and i can like communicate. with the person now which is probably the most [ __ ] up thing if i really think about it. but i was you know making these little jokes. here and there and then navy seals guys. were not laughing because they they just [ __ ] i probably killed 40. guys you know what do. you laugh at if you've killed 40. guys so i was like i'm just not even. gonna try with them. and then people were going around. the room saying like what are you gonna. do this weekend you're in albuquerque. what he gonna do you got two. days off and i just said i you know i decided i'm gonna run for mayor. of albuquerque and the [ __ ] navy seal. dude laughed hard and i was like oh that's what broke. him and i was into. it and then i was friends. with the navy seal. guy the navy seal guy. afterwards was like he brought it up. again he was like so what do you think is gonna be like your platform. that you run on wow. you wanted to play. yeah and so i said to. him well you know. i'm really religious so. and he started laughing. again more oh that shit's the kind of [ __ ] that makes me feel bonkers. good dude he would ask me. more my performance i wanted to. pleadin wanted to play. more and i was like we're doing it. dude i love making people. laugh dude that's it. man that's it that's all i ever wanted to. do man that's all i ever wanted. to do i heard my dad. on the podcast the other day. and he said that's all i ever wanted. to do and i was like oh [ __ ] he's right it is all i ever wanted to. do so i'm anyway i'm a big. army hammer fan after all. that [ __ ] because he let his kids suck his towel for a fun fun goof [laughter] man sex is weird. huh my favorite [ __ ] too is like i saw who the [ __ ] was it i saw a girl on on twitter she's always popping up. in my [ __ ] like people either respond. to her or something i can't remember a [ __ ] name i think she follows me but she was like but she was like she just is gangster on her twitter [ __ ] what is it i don't remember and it was like all like people just because twitter is like the wild west like instagram you can barely post a [ __ ] well i mean you can't post a nipple you know some of these co watches ads they're basically het porn but like you know these girls would be like co watches and they'll have their watch like this and their nipple they're just like it'll be like that [ __ ] ping pong thing where the in south park where the ping pong ball keeps coming either i don't know the [ __ ] but it's like co watches on instagram and it's like scientists sign to. use my code 20% off co. watches and we're like where's the co. watch it's coming out of it's coming. out of her i get it. and but this girl's. gangster like because on instagram. riley read is what it. is that's what that's hurt. her that's her name and and she and i was and i looked at her. twitter and it's like gangster like these poor. i don't know if i don't really i haven't seen many porn. stars on twitter but this. one i should look at more. to see if they're all like this. but this one was and i'm not trying. to be like holier than thou i watched. porn i'm not i'm not trying to. be like ooh i get all the things. that porn does i go on. pornhub you know what i mean. sometimes i check it out and i just see what's going. on and i window shop but um remember that. song by 50 cent use the window. sharper that was the last song. what 50 cent made were like okay. well i guess he's done. making songs huh so so it was like gangster. it was like just like it would be like a video. god this is a crass episode but that's what i saw. she would be like this. is how you see it. would be like this is how you stack [ __ ] and it'll be like three girls. on top of each other you know. like like there was anybody ever questioning. how do you stack [ __ ] you know like anyone was ever like ah [ __ ] i gotta go. on ask jeeves calm how do you stack [ __ ] jeeves you. just pretty much probably put a [ __ ] lady on a lady. on a lady also why are you doing. it just on a [ __ ] step one get a piano bench have one lady one lady lay down and then another lady lay down and then another lady lay down on her it will be like it's just gangster dude. and they just put that on the internet. like they have no parents. and then another one. will be like you know. we just walk like does. this be like a porn like we just want. to make you [ __ ] and to. be alone i got another girl with another girl and then just be like and i'm just like god. damn thats gangster i have no problem. with it but it's gangster you know what i mean. so then i would like but it's like oh and then but the funniest [ __ ] to. me was she was like i saw one tweet where it was like man. they deleted no [ __ ] i've seen a lot. of actually seen a lot. of like girls where it's like oh i can't. believe a deep deleted my instagram. porn stars i get it. but some regular chicks will be like ah i can't. believe they deleted my instagram. yeah [ __ ] stop stacking [ __ ] you know

get pissed. off and daily about things i've thought about when twitter started. and stuff like how annoying. it would be and just like the white. male bashing which you know. is so weird but like the tarantino thing. was the craziest to. me like when they were like what was i i heard an article about it. or i read an article about it. and it said once. upon a time in hollywood. this is bond and this is on nbcnews dot com. think opinion analysis essays hot. take hot take you know don't say. your own thing is a hot. take by the way for other people to. say a [ __ ] hot take you know hot. take my ass it says once. upon a time in hollywood. this is the title. once upon a time in hollywood. takes the sharon tate. murders and makes them about men come in tarantino's. new movie reframes a brutal. crime is a story about white male heroism that. does a disservice to. both tate and to. the story dude kitt and this is written. by a guy or girl oh [ __ ] look it's written. by a girl so yeah i didn't see the movie but you literally it's a the movies. about what it's about. i i don't even know. how to explain this. to a [ __ ] thickheaded person the movie isn't about the sharon tate. murders if it's not about the sharon tate. murders okay it's about what. it's about so i mean. how do i say this. and not make you seem like a [ __ ] idiot a movie is about what it's about. it's not about what it's not. about you're getting mad. that once upon a time. in hollywood is not about. the sharon tate murders is getting. mad at the movie transformers that. it's not about the sharon tate. murders in the right way. because the movies just about what. it's about so i don't i i can't. explain how you that's it. that's it you go like that. like we were in a court. of law and they were like well we you know. we're really looking into. this [ __ ] forensically about why this the white male made a movie about the sharon tate. murders and it's not about the sharon tate. murders then i come in with my business. suit because i'm a lawyer. and i say well you see movies. are about what they're about and then the [ __ ] judge goes. okay so george bronk and everyone goes. yeah that's true and look at this. leave it to. curtin tarantino to make a story about the murder. of sharon tate a truly horrific real. crime in which female cultists. murder a famous pregnant. woman that revolves around men. also what about quentin tarantino. who made kill bill. vol 1 & 2. that's about a chick i mean. dude this is just outstanding this. article this fuckedup dumb. [ __ ] article here's the thing. too i tweeted about it. it's so crazy how many people look i'm in hollywood. i'm a hollywood guy. but it's so crazy when i tweet something like that. the traction it doesn't get because people are. so so scared to. even like something negative. about something about this. article because then they're like well. i don't to be racist. or whatever the [ __ ] it is you're getting mad at the wrong. [ __ ] dude quentin tarantino is in a bad eye he's a bad guy he's not a bad guy i don't know this [ __ ] doesn't mean he's a bad guy i mean them look at this. for the most for most of the film tate. and samantha family girls our. sideline seemingly so the real stars this. is an excerpt from the thing. for most of the film tape and some manson family. girls are sidelined seemingly so the real stars. leonardo dicaprio and brad. pitt can do their thing. yeah yeah how about this. yeah they're the two biggest oh you mean. the two biggest hey you don't have to. put them in you know. about real in quotes. do you know why because they're the real. stars of the movie because that's what the [ __ ] movie is about that's what the movies. about stop [ __ ] complaining this article is why trump's gonna get elected again. i mean it's so [ __ ] funny and then in the middle of says want more articles like this. sign up for the think newsletter. and get updates on the week's. most important cultural analysis oh. dude i want more taints like this. eat it look at this. but tarantino isn't interested. in who sharon tate. was anyway all he cares. about is what she represents. a sex symbol a woman cut down. in her prime i didn't see. the movie so i can't speak on that. um it's so funny man. the [ __ ] people like this is an article dude. imagine if i was this. famous as famous is something. that these people will just destroy me. how much should i say that's a [ __ ] quote unquote. problematic it's so weird. to me hot take what. does hot take me. bad take i for real okay. catch you later whoever wrote that hmm. no i know how a hot. take is but it's usually a bad. take you know i saw a tweet. that was like i camera what show. it was but it was like hey they cancelled. netflix canceled this. show but sure give eddie murphy's seventy. million dollars to [ __ ] make a special okay companies could do whatever man they just do what they want. you know mcclane about all you want. but it's like the internet. man it's the best and worst. huh innit it's so [ __ ] crazy i got to. see that movie though it's three hours. long movies that are three hours. long or just too long. huh just like i'd go see. a movie that was 50. minutes it's like even comedy. specials like i did i'm gonna do. that's why i did that. halfhour comedians of the world. won i was like alright maybe this will be the new thing. to do and you know i'm doing. my hour again i'm doing another hour. for netflix but like i just want. to do like a 45 50. minute one i feel like [ __ ] in hours long i used to. open up for jo koy he used. to do two hours. he would kill the whole. time but i was just like aren't these people. [ __ ] tired i don't want to. do two hours at a certain point. it becomes an ego. thing not maybe not two hours. but like i remember [ __ ] somebody was on stage at the laugh factory i can't remember if ship i think chapelle did like a long was just [ __ ] around on stage for a while and then i think i think dane did like eight hours or some [ __ ] on the stage of the laugh factory like what are you doing that's so long it's always sad at a point at a certain point not two hours but like some guys will do like three hours it's like what do you live go do a life i know that's not the norm he doesn't do eight hours all the time but like obviously it's just like i don't know he was going through some [ __ ] yeah i think right now if i ever do eight hours on stage i'm going through some [ __ ] i didn't want to. be on set for eight. hours yeah let's see i mean. dude between the army hammer. sucking a kid sucking his toe thing. and then the [ __ ] quinn tarantino thing. that just was like hilarious. to me like that this. [ __ ] internet what this world's just going nuts iii. ii it's weird when i'm like how i've been i've been on set. all day every day and i just like it's weird. how like you can just i bet. if you have like a real job like my job is not a real job doing standup. like i'm traveling i'm doing my show. for an hour i'm doing two. shows sometimes an hour each for a night and then the rest of the day i can do whatever i want so i know what's going on in the world but i wasn't really doing that like we're so hot i mean my [ __ ] outfit for the movie i'm not really checking my phone and i'm just kind of like i don't know what's going on in the world so i feel dumber like actors or can like they'll will get you gotta like i mean let me tell you the did think about the movie taken that badass [ __ ] movie that i loved and liam neeson's one of my favorite guys okay think about how much of it is actually him doing something like they have to. set up so you shoot. like a page like a page. a day or something. or two pages a day three four or five pages a day sometimes or if you're really crunching it you do like six pages a day or some [ __ ] in a script the script is 120 pages. in taken i'm sure it's a big. budget so they were doing not that many pages. a day but a scene you will. shoot a guy walking and putting his keys. down turn on the tv. that scene from start. to finish will take like three. hours to shoot. it so liam neeson for three hours. is walking into. a door into. a room putting the keys. down turn on the tv. and then they go okay. cut we got to. change the light that guy camera. liam's taller than the thing. and we got to. do that we got to. make sure and then maybe liam neeson's like oh that doesn't work that doesn't work for me i need to. walk in and put it down with my left. hand so then they're like oh [ __ ] we gotta film. it from this side. so now that scene takes three hours. if you if that's your job you're and you don't do anything else you're dumb. as [ __ ] i'm not saying liam neeson's dumbest [ __ ] he probably reads or [ __ ] you know this is the podcast i don't know what the [ __ ] he does but like if you're just like the past week i've just been sitting on set doing and i'm dumber i'm [ __ ] dumber i have to. read a book out of my book in la i gotta get a new book but i'm dumber because i've just been sitting around in the [ __ ] desert i really feel dumb dude you ever have those days where you just feel [ __ ] dumb there's like a cloud in your [ __ ] head that's how i feel i used to. call them wax paper days. it feels like there's a piece of [ __ ] wax paper over your face. that's how i feel but i'm still here. for you guys mostly because of the money. though at this point you know they became very lucrative this. podcast so but i do really love you. guys well i really like you guys. you know i don't want someone to. stab me because if they i said i'd love to. them and they're like are we married. stalkers are nuts ah stop you know some people like dm me. over and over and over and over and over again. just talking about anything just like a lamps like for real. and i'm just like and i don't really read. it but i'm some every now and then i'll click on one. and i'll scroll and this person's dm to. me 50 times or more and they're talking about things that i don't give a [ __ ] about and i'm just like ah what do you think this is here are you a fan or are we got the energy. that goes into. that huh crazy i've had people email. me every day for years. i don't know how they got my email i [ __ ] block him. it's [ __ ] scary out there. dude i'll i i read this book. i was nervous about this. person once i read this book. the fear the gift. of fear by who's it by. and it's so good man. this book is so good it's about you know stalkers. and how it reads. like a thriller but it's an actual serious. like it's a real it's nonfiction. and and it's about how like when you know. somebody when somebody's like giving you because sometimes people will like call. people and be like i'm watching or whatever. the [ __ ] it is or like they'll you know that make up. dummy internet accounts and they like try to. scare you you oh you know. if it's in it's like you know. who it is the whole. thing is is like you know. who the person you're that. is stalking you is you you just don't realize you know. who it is which was like the craziest [ __ ]. that was like the weebey meme. and then i thought about and i was like i know what the person. who's doing this is because it was under a dummy account. i was like oh i know who this. person is and i figured it out. and then when i figured it out. i i did my life. the way gavin de becker i get i'd lived. my life in defense. of that and the person. stopped that book is so smart. i can't recommend it. enough even if you don't have stalkers. it's a good thriller read. but who doesn't have stalkers nowadays this. is the internet if you're a chick. and you don't have a stalker. you just don't know you have. a stalker here we go. another opinion that's gonna piss me. off let me click on it. oh these boy they do try. to this clickbait this. hot hot
