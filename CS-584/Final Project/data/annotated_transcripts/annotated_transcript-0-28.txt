it 3: oh 3:30. but here's the deal so makes sense. then i went to. bed no no we were watching a movie. i can't remember what we saw but uh and then great. right before we went to. bed billy started crying so oh no does that. happen a lot no no. not a lot at all. and if it if one if if anything it's like a whale. or two like oh yeah okay but he was like crying. like legit so i was like let's just pick. him bring in bed. we've never done that. with billy before were you nervous like i know what's i was like oh yeah so we bring him. up put him in bed. he's he's just like this. oh so he's chilling. oh that looked like him. that was so weird i'm you do. good billy impression and war. warner her and billy are. my the ones that i really k. so um you guys are g to. love this one it's my son. if you knew him you'd love it. um so uh so i basically uh we brought him. in to the bed. tried to go to. bed and it was he was just you nervous. at all with the little little little guy. no because he's between us and he was just like to. you yeah what do he want. just attention oh who knows right. you know and i go go. to sleep go to. sleep and then i hear like he's unzipping. the sleep oh no yeah so funny. and i all right okay i can't. fall see i'm going to. just go take i went to. go i was like whatever i grab i'm going. to take like if it's zil. or ny i don't know. what we have i took it it's night. so irresponsible whatever i grab bro. i passed out with an infant. right next to. you i passed out i passed out. and then i woke up at 9:30 and i was i felt like i was upside down. and then that's a bad feeling. and it it was terrible. i drank coffees and i still feel really weird. but whatever are you dizzy. yeah i'm i'm a little dizzy. i'm a lot better though. nyquil dud very few people. this happens to. it has the exact opposite. effect it wires me. so hard that's crazy. doesn't make me even. a little it does. the opposite it doesn't there's been probably three times or four. times that it's made me feel. this way and obviously i'll take more than that. uh usually it'll put me. to sleep and then you wake up. i wake up i'm like i'm okay i i can maybe i be like oh i definitely took nyquil. but i wonder it's cuz you just never ever. ever really put ever put alcohol in your body. i never yeah i never never yeah. that must be what it. is so your body just has this outsize reaction. yeah um all right well you want to. do a submission sure. all right so close. hey chris and matt love. the show subscribe to. the patreon so drunk uh really appreciate you. guys for someone who's reluctant to. therapy this show does help. oh good forgot to. meet you the couple times. you've been in iowa sick yeah. i got to see you. earlier this year very cool. very very nice awesome. uh my question is about towels do you guys. use them once throw them. in the hamper great. question throw them in the dirty. clothes whatever you call. it or do use them. again every time i ask someone this question. i always get a different answer. some people think it's gross. some people use it more than twice. right uh are you guys opinions on this. love you guys let me know it's a good. question question because i do something different. than what i did when i was a kid. when you were a kid. well in our house the hand. towels we would reuse yeah but the shower. towels or the bath towels would always go one. and done okay and now i i don't do that. i just use them all. the time i i i i use shower. towels three times three times yeah yeah i uh here's the thing. about this you are at your very cleanest when you use a towel exactly. so the i get why you would be like oh i want. to wash it but why. you would need to. is insane it's a waste of water. you don't need the towels take up. a lot to to. clean like you wash two. three towels it's like a whole lo especially if you're you. live alone and it's just you that's wild. also the only reason to. wash a towel is if you use it. and then ball it up. up and throw it cuz then you can get mildew and it can get kind of gross. i'll do that if i do that. you hang it up. if you hang up the towel should be fine. it dries in an hour. and it's fine in fact it's as fine. as a thing could be as a used. thing could be it's just you're as cleanest. possible all you have is water. on you you dry yourself. off hang up the towel it. dries off that's it. use it again yeah it's it's you. very cleanest and it's just water. yeah and if you're and if you don't use. it again you're wasting you're wasting water. you're wasting precious resources. water i wish it was. fy was no you know. what i'm doing not that. yeah george brett n you're not doing. george brett nope water down. my leg wow there's three waters. that we have what's the other we have three. water what's that's incred do. you know which one i'm doing. you thought it was george. brett for sure i thought it. was george brett no we have there's another one. and and i think i've told you too. uh uncle vinnie when i don't. even know this one when he we i was talking about what he drinks. he like i used to. drink you know i used to. drink soda all the time. you know and i but i don't drink. it anymore i'm older. and you know it's easier. to gain weight i said so so what do you drink. then and he says water. and i said oh well what if you drink. when you're not drinking water. and he said water. oh that's so him so him dude. wow good for him water. and i dude that's so something. he would think is funny. dude yeah yeah yeah have you heard you. does that you recollect that. or no no you haven't told me. that all right um yeah dude. he's coming soon i know he's coming real. soon and you know what i have. for him water um he i'm going. to bring it up. next time he won't remember he'll what. he'll do is he'll sit. and listen mh the pause. after you tell him will be too long. and then he'll laugh hard. the pause after i asked him. what he drank if he didn't drink water. was too long yeah. yeah that's what he does. the leas do that. well especially dad and his brothers. it's crazy i was just talking you. were there we were talking to. dad about how he answers. questions oh god dud it's like it's unbelievable. have [music] you it's hard. to even explain because it's so it. is hard uh i i i i oh here's what he'll. be like i well it's not even. just answering questions he'll be like i the godfather. is my favorite movie. and you'll be like oh man. um uh copa does great. movies he had a great early. on in his career. and he started making some weird. ones uh what other movies do you think are like fantastic. from copa and he and he will he will literally say the godfather. is my favorite yes yes that's exactly. one version of and you're like well that's not what i asked. and we covered this. also another version is oh oh you i remember. you took that drive up the coast. said one time what was that. like when you went on that. drive and he'll say yeah. yeah i took that drive oh there. you go and you're just like yeah. yeah yeah it's it's it's a kind of thing. where if it's such a specific. thing that if if we didn't if somebody just started doing. that in their life mh and was 30. you'd be like oh what happened. to this guy but he's been doing it. all the and it's like he's like i no. we'll talk about what it. is that i'm talking about i guess. right but it doesn't it's not the vibe. it's like a fle or a power. he just has a unique. really interesting thing his brain. is just like a special brain. he just answers that way. it's part of what makes him. so funny honestly for sure. um all right let's do another submission what's up. what's up chris today i have a question. regarding workplace. microwave etiquette so today i walked into. the break room trying to. heat up my lunch and i saw that somebody was already using the microwave. no big deal okay. however they had had the timer set for about 4. minutes i think and nobody was in the room. waiting for their food. to be done in the microwave. anyways the timer goes off and a minute. goes by and another minute. goes by third minute. goes by and still nobody's coming to. pick up their food. take it out so my question. is at what point. do i take their food. out of the microwave. and put my own food. in in my opinion that's never because people don't want. other people touching their food. true however it feels crazy. to me that you're going. to set the timer and then walk out of the room. as if you're the only person that works. in this office now it's not. just one person that does it. it's multiple people so there's not really something. i can say to. a specific person but it just puts. me in an uncomfortable situation. every time that it happens. and it's happened multiple times a good. question hopefully you can help. me out thanks i wouldn't care. if someone moved mine well here's the thing. at all it's one. thing to set the timer walk away but you have to. set a timer yourself to. come back and make sure you come back. within a minute of it. being a minute a minute. max you wait if you wait long. if you wait longer than minutes. you're crazy dud that's coming out. i'm eat it's mine. now i'm eating it well that's m that's take it. out put it next to. it it's like you don't you're not out. to touch other people's food. you're just out to. use the microwave so like. take it out put it on top. of the microwave or next. to it wherever is convenient. but like you have every right. dude if somebody was like after 5. minutes like what did you touch. my what did you touch. my food you'd have every right. to be like what do you mean. did i touch your food. i needed to. use the microwave of course. i touched your no i needed. to use the communal microwave. that's what i did in and in doing that. i'm i had to. touch your food yes. but also you can just like i the touching. the food thing is weird. it it i get it. if you're like uh and you stick. your finger in someone's like. bowl of pasta but like you there's so many ways. of like handling it without m breathing on it. without you just you know. and i'm the i don't want people [ __ ] with my [ __ ] you tou the plate. you don't touch of course. yeah no it's not a big. deal to me in the short. ribs and then just like slide. it with the plate. yeah like you just grab the [ __ ] plate. and then you slide it. off yeah yeah and oh let me get the rest and then um i yeah i don't i think that's really weird. i i i would not jump. to it if the if it went. off if nobody was in the room. i'd wait for a little bit if you needed to. use it yeah yeah of course yeah. how long though is the question. well i you i mean this. is something i would do i don't i think most. people wouldn't do this but i would walk out. and be like hey who's using the microwave. yeah i'm g to. use it can i take your food. out or do you want to. do it do it less dick. than that i would do it. i would do it less dick. than that i would do it. i would like start it. with this you know guys you know like a sing. it depends on where you work. too but if it's just any normal. office that's not improper. etiquette what you just did. that's totally normal i would do. it nicer now it sound dick. that's respectful to say. hey is somebody you're letting them. know their things done may i mean. i've put things in the microwave. and walked away and forgotten. not me i have a brain. because something comes up. that is more important. and then you get distracted. and then all of a sudden it's three four. five minutes later and you're like oh yeah. no i've never done that. okay i bet you have but yeah no i've never forgotten. something that was in my with a coffee. nothing ever yes you have nope. yes you have no i'm telling you. right now that's never happened. i decided that you have though. so it's okay cuz i already decided that it didn't so oh okay well yeah do women. will try to. control your life take it. out i would say don't let her. but there's nothing you can. do okay s deeper. once they've got their hooks in you're [ __ ] let's go hi. madden chris uh zach here i know playing playdoh. he was a guest. on the private my daughter um you might recognize. me from my work on a podcast. called the private record um i'm the guy. that wrecked a uh a truck. into a river. yeah working on yellowstone a frozen. river um s i have something. that annoys me that i wanted. to ask you guys about and see how much this. annoys you um my wife is a quarter mexican. um that's it that's what annoys but she's very white very white mexican. and she speaks kind of like a valley. girl she kind of sounds like a valley. girl when she talks but when her family's around. or her mexican family is around. she has a couple trigger. words that uh turn very mexican. yeah one being um cilantro. she'll say cilantro normal but then she'll go cilantro. or uh instead of tortilla go th like thia or something like that she does that. in front of like her. mexican family but then talks normal rest of the time. she has like five or six. of these that she does. and she never does. it ever unless they're around. and it drives me crazy. i'm i don't even know. what to say to. it i'm like are you are. you married to alec. baldwin or something what's going. you yeah so how how can i i i do i just ignore. it why what would you guys. do situation because um it annoys me a lot. so uh i'd like to. see what you guys to. say about it okay. thank you love you. guys another good question. let me go gra really sweet. looking dud i ah but yes of course i will. get the cilantro and tortilla dude. honestly that is it's so funny. because like you know how like the influx of like um latinx. uh in the in the media. and like how like it's like yeah. celebrate your uh heritage you. know and in the '90s it. was not like that like they were all. changing their names to. like white last names. in media well not just the '90s. all the way up to. the yeah i know ob. in our lifetime oh okay. and so um and now they're like like i i've seen. people change their names. from the white one. they picked to now. they're like go back yeah. or or or something you or it's like. do you know i'm act i've seen women. like you know i'm actually. like a quarter this and like then they just not that. they're not but they're like over. it's like all right you know. if you're 30 and you made it white the whole. time but dude the and now you're just like oh wow. i'm swimming in this pool. like but but in those cases there's an incentive. you're in hollywood you're more. likely to get cast i know. i know i know a dude. who never worked and then suddenly he was constantly working yeah. and obviously he didn't change. how good he was but he's mex he's fully mexican. has a mexican last name but does not. look mexic me but just because of his last name. being what it is people can be like he's our. diversity h well he did nothing he didn't do. anything that's okay it's nothing. he didn't do anything that's great. for him nothing yeah that's letting the time. changes around you but dude. i i i mean there's so many like even comedians like well. like it's like oh you know. i'm actually you know it's like dude. for 35 [ __ ] years if there's one thing it doesn't and apply. to is comedy and i know no. well should give a [ __ ] no totally but just up nobody should give a [ __ ] now now you say tiana now after you've been like tiana the whole. time now you're saying they change the way. they talk oh yeah oh really oh yeah. oh that's weird how inauthentic. yeah this though is a i think with this. is way more natural and understandable. she's around her family. 100% they talk a certain way. absolutely it's like mom she has a jersey accent. but when she's with her. jersey family it's like she's like [ __ ] car forgivable. for sure if it's your family. like even us when we're around. uncle vinnie and dad. and uncle richard like we'll be more like hey forget about not exactly. but hey you guys come. sit on over here who's getting whacked. today suck my [ __ ] ball. inest suck on my [ __ ] bolts. bolts um incestuous all right. but yeah no i think uh i think it's okay. i think though if it bothers you just bring it. up with her and be smiling. cuz it's funny to. be annoyed by that. hey why do you [ __ ] do that. well look dude that i joset and trap. did you watch it no. just the trailer how you know. he does that oh my god he does. the whole movie he's so good. in it i saw the trailer. i saw the movie and he does. that i i but he does. it even more than just in. the trailer so you knew. that i did not know. that okay he's that choice. he made is great he's awesome. dude uh i i never knew that honestly. he's been serviceable always been gone. so long why he says because he started to. get weird about how famous he was or not. how famous how people specifically were reacting. to him in the world. he was like i i recently. read him saying something. like this where he was like i began. to be this thing that was made me feel really. weird and bad uh what i think what he tried. to do was shift. into acting into weirder smaller. stuff but then nobody gave a [ __ ] they were like who cares about josh. haret being in like some indie where he's like. a weirdo we don't want. that we want him. to be like the hottest guy. in the world cuz he is he's all right. and well now he's just like a regular handsome. guy but back in the day. like in version suicides it was. like a joke what he looked. like no he's a handsome. dude for sure um i'm joking. he is but no uh he was great. that's weird though what about the money. though you know i think the money. was uh probably sorely missed. when he stopped working he turned down. superman what oh you didn't know that. yeah he turned down the role. of superman henry cille one no no. before that uh the uh brandon. no you know what i think. it might have been the one. that cage was gonna. do wow like way way way back like early. a i didn't know that yeah yeah whoa. crazy right uh anyway it was the best. he's ever been in trap. i believe that um but uh i dated a a girl once that we went to. we were in florida. visiting her family in north of florida where it's the south you know kind of it's not like so confused i know north of florida orth florida is miami. and and so multicultural north florida. is the south oh i get you yeah. yeah yeah and so she just started we were. at a w house and she was talking to. the waitress you just started talking like this. and i was like and i was waiting for the joke. she looked at me. i like what are you doing. and she's like what and i was like you're talking. in a southern accent. she's like i am oh. yeah no that's the other thing. people definitely don't know they're doing. it yeah but she that she's not. from the south so so further to. my point she didn't has no reason. to talk that way and yet. yeah she was doing it. and didn't even realize she might realized. it and what i'm trying. to trick me what i'm going. to say is going to. piss him off so much try to. what american south and english proper are very. similar accents oh so. unbelievably mad well well does it. piss you know it doesn't matter. because we could is a lot. like well you know it. doesn't matter because we could totally different. i know in our minds. they're different but they do really they're very simil. honestly i don't even really. care about it see. that's that's being mad though. no it's all good oh all. right good you're three for three. mco you were right dude. they're good so far no pressure. i clean the

married and have kids ball. one but still nonetheless closeted. blanks dude remember when l. panella got fired for making a comment about mexicans about how he was like he's mexican. be careful don't let him. and he made a joke. about not letting him. like get close enough to. pickpocket you so bad it's so bad. but here's the thing that that made it. all even messier lou panella is. mexican so he was making a racist. joke about mexicans while being a mexican. that didn't save him nor. i mean that's such a bad that. is like a a racist. joke you know what i'm saying. but it's his race. though it's confusing right right. it is confusing and then also let's say look. race there are racist jokes. oh wait no oh oh oh oh no. it was steve lions who oh. right i got it wrong. i got it wrong. okay he said it to. lup panella okay got it wow. i remember that steve lions who. and i remember that was when lanella l. panella said hey dog you kidding. me lella was one like is he making a joke. to a friend 100% yeah okay he was obviously. don't do that on television. yeah and i think no this. is what it was it. got construed as racist. because he's mexican oh so it wasn't even. him being no oh so he was just making a pit. pocket joke i believe so yeah see that sucks when cuz sometimes right now it's the left the left is so racist that they make it racist when it wasn't racist do you know what i'm saying you're saying presume it was racist and therefore make it worse exactly if you presume it's racist when it's not racist then you're the racist this is what's weird about this is that it's mlb they don't have a political position now here's the thing zack brath once during the some uh music like the what the emy emmy not what is it the grammys farel came out in an outfit that looked like what the monkey bellhop war in a movie the monkey bellhop and it was a monkey bellhop okay and then zack bra tweeted. nice outfit for real look. right there with the monkey oh uh whatever not the bellhop. but like look look it. looks like got it okay. i make it so we can see it. i don't remember this. but yeah at all but so he's dressed in the same. way and it's like he didn't do. that because he's racist. he did that because he dressed the same. people were like wow and then zack br. tweeted like oh man this is so dumb i didn't even realize like obviously oh so he said and it's like obvious. he didn't mean it. like that something about him. being a monkey he no. but he obviously meant look at the outfit. it's like forel goated people into. doing it you know i get it. but what did he say. is all i'm wondering i don't know. who wore it better he showed two. pictures oh it was a tweet yeah. got it go oh oh yeah. that's so clear wasn't like look. at this monkey right. i thought you meant he said it. live during the show. no no no no he tweeted. it and of course he didn't mean. to be racist look at the outfit. yeah weird huh forel. even forel put was like let's see what what white. person [ __ ] up did fel have anything to. say about it put on the hat. the buttons has tourettes did he did fro say. anything or was he just like not. even what dude if how would ever answer. to zack brath is hilarious. it just feels like claps back. to zack bra i. would imagine f would be like you guys. chill out he obviously was making fun. of the i know but i'm saying for him. to even register. it publicly is hilarious. i just didn't know how big of a deal. zach who can we talk about one. more of these the kelly. osborne one on the view. have you seen that no. oh yeah the way she acts afterwards. mass awesome what is it. let's just play it okay. it's a lifeline luxury. style thing but we'll do it. if you want to. sign up for lifeline luxury. this is the stuff we do. on lifeline luxury it's very funny. but we don't normally do. it on but uh little taste yeah. patreon dot com but this kind so fast. nobody knows what it said remember mic. something the way she acts afterwards. is so gangster if you kick right. right here is every latino. out of this country. then who is going to. be cleaning your toilet. trump oh that's in the sense. that you know what i mean. there's more there's more jobs to. be in la they always but but are not only the only people i didn't mean. it like that come on no. i would never mean it. like that i'm not part. of this argument with i think what you're saying. is that trump himself. probably relies on a lot. of these people that i me. it's actually so david brent that. is yeah i mean the the immediate. it's crazy how quickly she realizes she [ __ ] up. she did a good job. actually did she i think she did. she does she does not look like uh. oh it looks like she's like all right. i know what you're going. to do this is not how i meant. it she should have slowed down. though like she's doesn't stop talking she that. was one of the best examples. of just powering through it. i think wow honestly w but she got did she get fired. or or what i don't know. what happened was she even. a host or a guest. it's weird because if you said that. as a joke you could get away. with it but she i don't know if she tried. to it did not sound. like it but i mean. something like eric griffin. would [ __ ] say that [ __ ] h going. to clean all the toilet. getting eric griffin in trouble. yeah what if you could do that. like say you know who would say that. and then say someone and then they get canceled. for not even ever saying we're a step. away from that that's [ __ ] hilarious that'. be amazing in a satire. actually that would be funny. d so funny everybody. gets canceled everywhere always you're getting. canceled why cuz you would say something. like this yeah because no because so and so said you would say yeah. that's good that's funny but he said it. okay go ahead next one. cute i again and wow. i do have one more question. for you there was no question. do you guys like when chris kristen or matt. a girlfriend of yours wears your clothes. around the house like tshirts. or hoodies or something i love. wearing my husbands cuz they're just so comfy. but i'm sure there are guys out. there that don't love that so let me. know your thoughts and chris i didn't get to. say this last time. but my husband and i got to. go to your show. in columbus when i was super. pregnant with this crazy lady and we loved it and he's not a fan of standup. comedy in general but he was laughing. the whole time oh awesome. i love hearing that. that's cool thank you um i have a take on. this for sure 100% i it's it's very cute. i love it and kristen always picks the thing. i have been saving. to wear like on a friday. night got it i'm just like oh. you're wearing okay well okay let me go a little further. with that every guy likes that. yeah every guy that they're the only time. a guy might not like that. and i don't i'm just like i don't know. why this is popped in my head. but if a guy was like insecure. about how something smelled i could see. them being like oh but dude. every guy likes that when a when their girlfriend wears their clothing. they like to see it. like it feels like well it's super cute. it's cute it's too big on them. usually right right right and it feels there's like a closeness that. it sort of evokes. i don't think any i don't think there's any guy. that would be like get that. off really going for it. you know there might be a guy imagine that. what guy would be so weird. though get my [ __ ] shirt off get my shirt who would get my pants. get my hat get it. off get my socks. off and you're wearing my underwear. get why are you dressing like me. why is she wearing all of his clothing. though that that would be a little weird. um yeah i i like it. i love it even. even when she does pick the thing. that i was going. to wear i'm like oh she looks so cute. thank you i appreciate that. okay uh yeah no everybody. likes that i love how her. first question we'll never know. what it was you just nixed. it dude was it just t no. no just he picked the one. he wanted to pick i get it. okay i'm jumping in your throat. no she uh sent something. another week got it so she she explains. sorry i get it so doesn't want him. to say what all right. u no she he didn't we didn't used. the the first question that she ever. submitted and then she said hey another question and so no that's not it. either that's it see didn't no matter. what happened that's it. she she was on the show. before and she went on to. explain something that i thought was like kind of immaterial. or like didn't matter well who are you. god who died and named you. [ __ ] king okay okay let's do it jesus. king um all right next one. all right so wow took so long mo. question swall hard people with vests. and clipboards and areas. rapping that you just want to. hang out you want to. get a coffee but they're always in your way. and they're always fake complimenting you like hey like your glasses. would you like to. end world hunger or would you like to. see a picture of a dog. where you can see the ribs. you know what i mean. and you're just like i just want to. get my coffee would you like to. see a picture of dog. see his ribs you're like but also like i i can barely afford. my coffee so i don't know. if i'm the best person. to be ask so much. yeah spin move mentality right. like what can we do. i i i don't know you tell me. sh also this is my impression. of crystalia dude got out of out. one all right guys love. you what do you think about that. what you christopher walkin doing kramer. what do you think about the how did it. make you feel when you watch saw him. do it it was okay. i it takes a lot. to make me feel [ __ ] weird now. dude because made me feel really. weird i get and it's but yo i i mean. how much awkwardness i've dealt with in. my life is just so that was crazy. though because now everyone who wants to. see that can see that. because it's in the world that's different. i get that but why why do you think he did. it he's just being silly. he just wanted to. be silly he just like i don't care. i'm going to be silly. you think so you asked me. and that's it seemed like maybe that was the whole. reason he did a submission i don't think so no i don't think so um okay uh what was the question. the people who like green peace. people who like want to. make you sign up. for stuff i just look at them. before they finish the ending. their sentence and i just say. sorry and i keep moving. sorry because or sometimes. you're like oh which one do i pick. like are you excuse me. are you registered to. vote you're like which one do i pick so they can't talk. to me uh yes and they're like oh okay. never mind you know. what i'm saying yes and they're like good. because we're getting people to. oh [ __ ] i [ __ ] up no you know what i forgot i didn't do it and i just i uh do the same thing. every single time and it works. every single time what the best. one is i have the best. one go ahead and just walk past. them like this i everyone even better. they come up to. you while you're on the phone. you have every right to. be like i'm sorry i'm on the phone. what are you doing and they have no choice. but to be like oh i'm sorry. because to do anything. else would be to. be so [ __ ] rudee you don't bring the phone. up to your ear. you don't have anything in your hands. okay you don't have any ear. pods in or air pods. or anything yeahh and you look at them. and you say i'm sorry. i'm on the phone that you know. i'm going to do. that next that that would on the phone. that would work and honestly. they wouldn't be like oh what a crazy. guy they would think they don't see. the thing if you say it. right yeah i mean if you go like sorry. i'm on the phone think you're crazy. yeah yeah well then you it wouldn't matter. what you said they would think you're crazy. you be like who are you talking. to the smurfs all right. but yeah that was a really weird. impression that you did at the end. just to be clear. me no him yeah it was what would you rate. it out of 10. oh two and he only gets two points. because those are things you say the actual quality. of the got it impression. he did of you yeah. zero true true absolute could the simon cowl of doing. of rating my impressions couldn't have been less. like you okay that's it. you would know you're my brother. yeah that was terrible. [ __ ] awful oh w i mean you know going so absolutely terrible. what he did and he should be ashamed. of himself okay crucify him. ad my name is nathan. big love from new zealand. i've been a fan of you. chris since like there one picky. eaters so my wife she doesn't like to. try anything really even if she hasn't tried. it before i'm a try. so i'll try anything if i haven't tried something. in six months i'll try. it again maybe i like it now. so i say to. my wife hey try this. thing she's never tried it. before she'll look at it. and she like no i don't think i'll like that. mh so do you think that you have to. try something first before. you can say you don't like it. like a food or do. you think that you can look. at something and decide just by looking at it. and making a judgment with you. like what a great. question sh the answer is the answer. is if you were just to. answer this question the answer. is no okay however that's not. true isn't that interesting wait. what that that what you said. is more confusing than what. he said i know. it's confusing but it's still true. explain it thoroughly can. you know if you like something before. you try it the answer. is no the answer is no. however that's not true well then that's not the answer. do you know what i it. is i'm a philosopher in in a way. because it's like i'm very smart. and i thought of an interesting. way to say it and i just did. it and you're impressed he's. impressed he's impressed and everyone. who heard it in youtube. is impressed it's the wrong. way to say it but i get what. you're saying it's the answer is. not uh flatly no i don't think okay. i think there are if you've lived long. enough there are ways to. very very almost exactly. but maybe not exactly but very closely. approximate how you will be likely. to feel about something before. you try okay so i had a uh guy that i was talking. to in we were having a conversation. at montreal okay actually this. is the gayest thing of all. time so funny you say that. but he but we were talking about. uh being gay okay. me and a guy we were talking about being gay. a guy you're friends. with yes like at least friendly. with right the conversation was just like what. it's it's just like hey you know. i don't even really know. but but that's how it started. i know because then the third. guy joined the conversation he was australian and he said uh. oh you know what it. was it was that we were talking. about exactly what this. guy's saying do you have to. have oh oh oh no wow. i don't know if you're it. was like yeah maybe you don't know if you're gay. or not you know it. was like one of those things. like maybe you don't know if you're g. and and and the third guy. comes in the conversation he says oh. my i don't know he's like oh i know i'm not gay. and we were like it. was so definitive that we were like what how yeah. who the [ __ ] says that like that. and he says so i said to. him i said how do you know. i think i know and he says mate. when i was a kid. i was like really young. in my 20s i tried gay. sex i just had sex with my buddy. and let me tell you not for me. wow and we were i was like uh not for me. either and i've never done that. but how do you know exactly. but i know so i know that's i'm saying. both are true both are true. it's not true and that's not true. but i think and i'm a philosopher he's impressed. he's impressed anthony's going to. take a [ __ ] right now and he's impressed but i still think if we being philosophers about it. in a very absolute way. there's as much as you can approximate. mhm how you feel mh. there's no way there is. no way to truly know. so to say no is not untrue it. is in fact true it just is like so absolutist about. it it to. almost suck out right. meaning from it so suck. out meaning from the penis. so it's almost like to. suck out j so um it is not. true and then that is not true. that's amazing that is so not amazing. and it's so annoying that you think it's the way. i'm saying it makes it so much. [ __ ] cooler the way you're saying it. is just not the i'm say. boss way to say different. thing though the boss. way to say it is. no and also that's not true. what i just said no. in that case no is not true. yes no and that no is not true. so why would you say no. then is to. the no that's not true. you can say why you doing. the no at all if it's not true. why answer with a with an answer. that why respond. with an answer that. about in to. follow up with admitting that. it's not true there's what there's there. is in what lies. the philosop no idea how say want. to say but what do you mean. not for me blasted inside. him not for me. pulled out [ __ ] all over him and his guy friends not for me. [ __ ] you know michael [ __ ] remember dukakis yes yeah ' 80s nice what's says uh yeah i don't know i don't know what was he the thing he was talking was heaters food. oh heaters why did i think heaters food. is uh no you can't do it with food. dude you can't you never know. what you like you never know. what the food i mean. look i tried oy or not. oyster um octopus for the first time. mhm and i was like i'm not going. to like this and i did try. it and i was like yeah i knew that oh okay. well you know what you can. do with sometimes if you can like deduce. the uh text texture. of something because we know textures. we don't like regardless. of taste that's it. though interesting yeah the texture. yeah i know i don't want octopus because the texture. but nothing else right but as far as a thing. you've never tasted before. and you can't guess really what the texture. might be until you've tried it. there's no way to. know with food cuz i've so many times been like there's just i will not. like that i'm looking at it. and i know that and then someone's like you just try. it just try and i try i'm like that's the best. [ __ ] i've ever had in my [ __ ] life yeah yeah you can't yeah you can't yeah and obviously the other way around what i don't like is what i don't like is now here's something i don't like truffle okay so people will be like trouble. and i say i don't like trouble. and they'll say yeah but you got to. try these uhhuh now i'm pissed. and why are you pissed. because i don't like the [ __ ] flavor. and why don't they listen. to you when you say that. because they think that you're that. it's a different kind of thing. when it's just the now. you got try you're not trying. true hey i don't like annoy. i don't like curry you. haven't had real indian food. hey you know what bue. i love curry how could you not. like curry it tastes. like beo that's not true. it tastes when indian. food is cooked it smells. like boo a lot of the time. for me wow i just don't agree. yeah i don't know it's like a weird. cross thing [ __ ] that would be so disastrous cuz i love anyi food. if i thought that yeah i don't like but do you not. like it because of that. or you just no i've tasted. it a bunch and it's at best. okay you're crazy dude n one of the best. restaurants in la is indian food. bad mash bad mash you. know what that means shout out to. my boys over at bad. mash doing big things what's bad. bad mash mean it means like i don't. know what does it mean. it means like uh badass badass. it means badass wow so close. there you go so close to. the word could have just called. it bad but they the indian. version it's better to. call it bad mash bad. mash is a sick. sounding thing uh jim. car was so good in bad. mash too what's that. badass 2 what's badass. two jim car kickass man.
