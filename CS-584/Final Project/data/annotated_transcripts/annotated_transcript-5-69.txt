after he got that. like imagine getting hummingbirds. after mark mcgrath got them. and you're not mark mcgrath. like god he was on. the cover of rolling stone it's amazing. how [ __ ] changes and now he's like now he's like will smith and a little bit of a truck a little bit of trouble. [ __ ] dude i cannot watch those shows without getting actually depressed. miley cyrus got herself in a little bit of heat. today you know turns. out sam rockwell is a little bit is underwater so looks like [ __ ] who li came. to think of a person. literally jada pinkettsmith dress. was a turtle luke is a [ __ ] i can't. believe people watch that [ __ ] extra extra brown and then and then it'll always be some guy every time they get a new host it's some guy that you haven't seen in 12. years you're like oh [ __ ] the only guy that [ __ ] nailed it and and and [ __ ] dude you know how hard this is let me just explain to. you something about mario lopez this. guy is the [ __ ] okay this guy is a [ __ ] is do you understand. how hard what mario lopez did was he went. from one of dude the guy's attitude. is the [ __ ] here's the deal man. he was ac slater and for those young [ __ ] out there you don't know saved. by the bell say by the bell. was one of the biggest shows. for kids for us. when we were young. all right mario lopez was ac slater on this. show now he was the character. was awesome he was like the football jock type guy. and all the girls liked him. and he was a ladies man. and he [ __ ] killed it on the show okay there was screech on that show and then the other guys zack morris and screech basically i think blegh did a porn and learned karate that's how he was trying to. [ __ ] come back right. screech did a porn and learn. karate all right now the zack morris is whose name is escaping. me and i know the guy. which is [ __ ] pieces markpaul gosselaar. right great the nicest guy. he's had a career uh he was on. that show the baseball show. that's out now that which is supposedly actually pretty [ __ ] good i don't watch. it but that girl who's on is. like beautiful we're supposed. to like believe that. this [ __ ] gorgeous girl's. good at baseball and i don't even mean. that gorgeous girls can't be good at baseball. but you know it's it's real. hard to find a really gorgeous. gorgeous girl that would here's the thing. if i was a gorgeous girl. i would just [ __ ] you could get anything you want in life. you don't have to. do anything you don't have to. develop a personality because guys are pieces. [ __ ] and they'll just literally [ __ ] cater to. your every move so if you're a gorgeous. girl and you excel at. something it's even harder. congratulations you did it because you developed. the personality even though you. didn't have those girls deserve a medal. those girls deserve everything they want. because they [ __ ] you know girls talk. about oh you know some girls. talking about i was bullied. because of my body because i'm not you know. a model and this and that but dude. if you're a model and also you didn't use. that but really you got [ __ ] you made some [ __ ] happen with your life. and didn't just be like okay. [ __ ] it i'll just have guys google. me but anyway markpaul gosselaar isn't a show. but what what uh what uh mario. lopez did was became an a host. on extra and now this guy is. so everywhere and he has branded himself. and people don't even think of him. as ac slater anymore and that is the hardest. thing to do in hollywood. i think if you become known as something. i look at steve. urkel no matter what the [ __ ] he's done. is just steve urkel and he's tried. but mario lopez has overcome the. [ __ ] insurmountable odds and he's [ __ ] become mario lopez not ac slater and that dude is the [ __ ] what he's done is one of the hardest things and i commend mario lopez and also i follow him on instagram and i love following him in on instagram and also he's like what is he 42 and his body and he's got like seven kids has this guy do it he's incredible man uh but anyway i don't know what i was talking about oh yeah irvine so i was in irvine and oh yeah so you never know what the [ __ ] show is they're gonna you're gonna get gig and get the piece of [ __ ] trash oc or you're gonna get the the people who are like really like wellbehaved and nice i mean cuz osseous is awesome and orange county is is uh you know it's definitely cliquish and a lot of like rich white people probably a lot of racists but and a lot of like privileged [ __ ] but also they have like really smart asians and [ __ ] and like zero black people like i don't know like i never see black people in orange county but oh and they do have like latino type like mexicans and [ __ ] but they i did shows and i had a lot of really good shows oh so i kicked. 60 people out yeah that was [ __ ] years ago. but so then this these crowds were good. they have we had some chatter. [ __ ] when i open or shut him. down and they were good. for the rest of the time. i was on stage. but then there was one chick. one show that just kept going. yeah like that was her. [ __ ] like don't do that. i understand you're a fan. but laughs here's the heuer the things. you do if you're at a comedy. show you laugh or you don't. laugh that's it you cry. or you laugh let's pretend. you eat at a comedy. show a library that's what happens. don't need to. go that's so annoying that's so [ __ ] annoying and now again so free conch but you being piece of [ __ ] don't don't do what are you laughing at me wom fire i love when he laughs man because it makes me feel like cuz he's dead these guys are my only audience you know one fire one and wanna fire two i need to. get them two shirts with the things. with the thing one and thing two you know. yeah dude when i was a kid. i there were shirts. there was a shirt i wanted. like that i'm with stupid. and it had a [ __ ] arrow. to the left and i thought that. was the funniest [ __ ] ever you know to. just walk with somebody and have them be the on the left. and you're walking with i'm with stupid. it's you know what dude. i got to get a shirt. like that man i'm with stupid. with an arrow to. the left and just [ __ ] make sure it wherever you walk with is on your left. you know what kind of [ __ ] boss.

as a joke. about how i'm a fashion. blogger and some people think it's real and it's just like how dumb can you. be like how dumb can you [ __ ] be to. look at a comedians page. and think anything but oh this. is a joke you know. why it's because of [ __ ] comedians that post. dramatic [ __ ] on their instagrams. oh it drives me nuts. man every now and then it's fine. but some of these some comedians out. there are like i have great friends. and this and that and couldn't get through. you what do you what are you. doing what's your brand hey what's your brand. what's your [ __ ] brand dude what are you doing. people coming to. you for comedy i mean. it's cool like it's cool to. expand your brand like what kevin hart. is doing is cool he's he's in he's obviously. very funny but he also uses his instagram. to try and like brand himself. as a fitness guy because of health and he's trying to. inspire people and that's [ __ ] cool. that's good i like that. um but some of these guys just like or lost. online you know and not just comedians i feel like this. is a common theme. in congratulations but i mean man. i saw a [ __ ] girl the other day. i put it i put it in my i don't know. if it'll be like i put i put this thing. up on the like like what is this. this could be the most [ __ ] up instagram post. of the week i guess but like here. we go okay you guys. ready for the most [ __ ] up instagram. post of the week [music]. here it is this is the comment. i'm gonna just blow this. through because this is just kind of this. go super beautiful but taking time to. rica this is the caption taking time. to reconnect your inner self. is so important sometimes. you have to. have space and reflect on. your life without seeing. what everyone else is doing try. to focus on yourself. your goals and what really makes your soul happy. always be true. to who you are and be fearless. to be who you truly are. because no matter what someone is always going. to have something to. say i mean alright you know okay. but literally seven million people. said that yesterday you not i mean. you're not doing anything new that's the thing. the years there are there. there's this thing that we have in on social. media now like i saw this. girl that was like this. fitness girl that did all he's like sped up videos. that are like here's a little tasty snack. and she's like cutting up a cucumber. and like pouring lemon on. it and it's like and then she's like winks at the camera. and it's like huh. and it's sped up like it's a [ __ ] like it's sihyoung pitching in the 40s. you know but like those people are not creators they're not people. who advanced art or the world. in any [ __ ] way let me be very direct you're not i'm looking right. in the camera here you're not. advancing the world in any [ __ ] way. what you've done is and whether it's conscious. or subconscious you've seen other people do this and think oh that's what you do to. be successful to. have selfworth and then you do what. they did and you're going. through the motions but you are not a creator you are. just somebody who now knows how to. make a snack with cucumbers. and lemon and that's nothing. because we all know you. can do that anyway so if you're on instagram. posting a picture of yourself. and you're saying your selfworth. is this and that and don't let others. judge you you all you are doing. is repeating [ __ ] that you've said and that other people. have said rather you are not a creator and you have you. have no talent and that's fine. but don't [ __ ] go saying [ __ ] like this like it matters because it doesn't coming from you if kanye west goes. out there and says some [ __ ] it matters because he's a [ __ ] creator now like kanye west or don't but that's what is you could think he's a piece of [ __ ] and that's fine but that's what he is and and this culture that we have now where oh i've got somehow i've got eleven thousand followers because people wallow me because i'm aesthetically pleasing to. the eye now i'm gonna do this. and i'm gonna be a person just that. [ __ ] changes the world no you're not no you're not dude. it's just like what i was talking. about about how people who are [ __ ] rappers who rap. about the gun first and then get the [ __ ] gun you're a phony dude be who you are and then people will find out you can't [ __ ] get the people first cuz you have tits or you're a dude who has great eyebrows and a nice job on if you're a model be a model and look there are exceptions like you know i don't really know what tyra banks does but it seems like she has turned her thing into. a real thing and all that. i'm not talking about tyra banks not. talking about gisele i'm not talking. about actual [ __ ] you know i'm not even talking about models i'm just talking about people who i mean there's [ __ ] guys who are just like who do this who have [ __ ] 60 followers that are just like you know keep your inner circle it's a [ __ ] it's the oc mentality that i was talking about you're in a circle is a [ __ ] thing like you're not saying anything that [ __ ] changes anything dude shut the [ __ ] up you don't drool when you make love you're a [ __ ] robot i know you know i say this with no anger dude it's just come on help us out man we're all dying dude you see the world out there and you're talking about [ __ ] cucumbers try i guess order i don't know maybe you disagree with what the [ __ ] i'm saying maybe you disagree what the [ __ ] i'm saying but and then you got the followers and i'm not talking about even instagram just people who just believe in you that are like oh yeah man thanks i really needed this today how lost is that guy how loss is that guy that's like i really needed this inspirational quote well it's not gasoline you're not a car if you're reading instagram quotes to. [ __ ] get it inspired and helpful. oh man i don't i hope. you don't have kids all right. i'm gonna [ __ ] do some of these quote what do you call them. what do you call. them twitter questions right here are these instituto coates twitter quotes. it twitter questions here we go. kevin black blacky stone kevin blackistone at gator underscore. usa change yet gator you know. if you were a ufc fighter what would your walkout. song be and my guess is babylon that would actually be pretty cool. to [ __ ] with the [ __ ] and have some real or like have some josh groban. [ __ ] while you're coming out and everyone's coming out at to. like [ __ ] burn down don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't no or someone. else coming out like [ __ ] dmx but then you just come out. and it's just like you raise. me up do [ __ ] higher than mountains. you raise me up. and then just [ __ ] rear naked. choke somebody and then you leave raise. me up i would come out. to some [ __ ] like that uh here's a good question evan smith. at evans underscore myth wow. i want to. burn your house down with that.
