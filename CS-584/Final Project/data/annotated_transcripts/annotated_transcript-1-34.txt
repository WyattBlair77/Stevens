[music] congratulations i see i see i see. the fan isn't plugged in. i see and the reason. why the fan isn't plugged. in is because i need to. have my phone plugged in so that. means that i didn't plug. my phone in last night. and it also means that it's going. to be too hot. in here and those are just subsequential events. that happen to. transpire this moment so look here's the deal. i didn't charge my phone. last night the reason. why it was 10. p.m. and i was absolutely ely. exhausted so i went upstairs my wife wanted to. clean the whole place she wanted. to clean the whole house. and i say really and she says yeah and i say well. okay you can clean. the whole house but what do we do about. calvin and putting him to. bed because i am so franking. tired so i said why. don't i bring up. calvin into my bed. into our bed and we go. and we'll watch some cartoons and stuff. whenever you're done cleaning the place. you come up and you put calvin to. bed right so i bring calvin to. bed at 10:00 i put on something. like justice justice league cartoons or something cute. you know something kristen will just watch anything. with calvin that calvin wants she'll be like let's watch a big. climi pacman eating a bunch of you know. uh ghosts um but i can do that. for like five minutes and then i go. like this okay i have to. watch something else so i kind of find. the middle right i'm i'm i'm like hey calvin what do you want. to watch i bring him. by the way it is late it's 10. p.m. whatever he says i want to. watch big giant pacman. and i go like this. how about we just look at what's on. paramount [laughter] plus we compromise. on disney plus. i turn it on and there's like a justice league thing. and so i put on cartoons i go. boom and he goes and he starts. watching and i go like this. pass out completely the next thing. i remember is that it. is 9:00 a.m. it's 9:00 a.m. all. of a sudden i blink and it's 9:00 a.m. yes. dude he got so much sleep. it's unbelievable man it is like dude. and let me tell you something. i do this podcast always at 5:00. p.m. or 4 p.m. sometimes if i have a lot. of things to. do i might do it. at like 2:00 p.m. sometimes i do. it at 8:00 p.m. i get nutty dude. right now doing this. podcast it is 10:30 a.m. dude. i got so much sleep. and the reason why i got so much sleep. is because i changed my dude. he let he let people get to. his head he let people get to. his head is what he did. because i wanted to. leave look dude i don't look i used to. be the kind of guy that. is just like all right. i'm going to take the earliest flight. ever so i could have my whole day. i'm going to do. that if there was a flight. at 6: a.m. i took it thank god there. wasn't a flight at 4:00. a.m. cuz guess what your boy. would have took it i always said. to my travel agent. earliest one because i wanted to. get back but guess what for what what do. you need to. get back for comedian guy huh. what do you need to. get back for a 900 p.m. m show at the laugh. factory nah so i go like this. wait one day i'm just sitting by myself tired. as [ __ ] the airport at like 4:30. a.m. because you got to. get picked up earlier you know. and starbucks isn't even open you know. that that that uh dunin donuts isn't. even open they're trying to. rebrand themselves only to. be duncan but yeah right. change all the signs. first i'm not call. you duncan until you change every single sign that. you have you're duncan donuts. they're not even open yet. i'm at the airport like this. and i go like this. why do i why do i fly. why do i fly out. why do i fly out. at 5:40 a.m. i started flying. out late at least 2 p.m onward. dude guess what i didn't get sick. anymore i didn't get sick. sleep is the remedy. dude it is the remedy. a little bug might go. like this woo a little bug. might be like so go a little bug. might be going oo doing. tly worlders where can i fit where can i fit. o is that that guy. from is that that guy. from undatable right on my tongue. right if i have enough sleep. my sleepness goes attack. if i don't have enough sleep. my sleepness goes what's going. on uh who happened where oh there's an antib there's a there's a there's a foreign. body oh the antibodies are just too. tired man and they go. and i get sick but dude. the other day these are my crew. okay lulu denny sam. enrique we're all traveling and it's awesome. okay lulu and denny go. like this yo the flight's at 5:00. p.m. that's wait no yeah the flight's at. 5:00 p p.m. that's crazy i don't want to. waste the whole day we're going. to go early so they leave at 7:00. a.m. i go like this you guys. are going to. get sick why wow i'm crazy. i go you guys are going. to get sick they go. u well you know what i'm just going. to do it so in uh sam's like you. know you want you want to. stay the whole day and guess what because here's the thing. i was in baltimore. now before we even get into. when i took the flight let's get into. let's get into baltimore. hey baltimore what are you. hey baltimore what what's going. on in your city. now let me actually start by saying the people in baltimore. are awesome the people in baltimore. i find to be really i love. their energy they seem cool. they're on the level but hey buildings in baltimore. what's going on hey the greyness in baltimore. what's going on with you. hey places that are too. spread apart that i have to. walk to for instance. if i need to. go to the bank. that's cool but then why. is the starbucks nine blocks. away hey baltimore what are you hey baltimore. have a meeting get all. your buildings close together and stay there. and that's the city. okay because guess what i don't want to. have to walk nine blocks. to get to somewhere else that's second. on my erand list because that's more. time for me to. get my wig split cuz baltimore. you're violent as [ __ ] so maybe it's not the problem that 's. a lot of crime in baltimore. maybe the problem is the places. are too spread out cuz if the places. were together right who's going. to rob someone near a bunch. of people right it's like hyenas they. wait for the lion to. get away from the pride hey baltimore. you're too gray and spaced out. so baltimore is the city. is just so and also it's one of those. cities that has steam coming up. out of the ground. like what you know like you like where you're like oh. is this gotham you know. like new york has that but some places. baltimore everywhere you turn there's just steam coming. out of the ground. like like a giant is. vaping under a hotel and and so i get to. baltimore and i say hey man. is there a coffee. shop around not like a chain one and the guy says yeah starbucks is right around the corner and i say okay uh you're not listening to. what i'm saying or you're demented. is there a different one. and he was like oh no. you know what there's one in the hotel. i go in one in the hotel. it's fine it's great. it's nice and i'm there. and sam's like you. sure you don't want to. leave uh tomorrow early and i say i'll look into. it and i let sam color. my decision and i got a flight. at 7:00 a.m. and i connected in salt. lake city now everyone on the plane. from uh baltimore to. it like i thought it's weird. to have a direct flight. from baltimore to. salt lake city like what is that you know. it's like oh you're just like i guess. people here need to. get there but they did and the plane. was blonde as [ __ ] so they mormon. as [ __ ] um but i did and i didn't sleep. much and then i landed in salt. lake city i i i i um i fell asleep. the whole flight this is so interesting. even though it's not i fell asleep. the whole flight from baltimore. to what do you call. it salake city got the kect. gang kect gang ping ping bang. and then flew back. to lax dude. and then came home was tired. as [ __ ] the whole day. dude was tired of [ __ ] the whole day. i'm going look at this. i'm going to get sick. and i'm going to. get canker

anything i i there. are these people that we get behind that. are just whatever they do it's it's so amazing. right like kor reeves is. one of them okay kor reeves. could go out take his shoes. off in the sand and just take a large. dump in a boy's sand castle. and people will be like man. that can of reeves. is it's so cool. how he gives to. the community you know. and andre 3000 is. one of those people right. people think he's a genius. and i'm like i like look his music. is fine when they came out. with let's go through. the out let's go through. the outcast catalog okay let's go. through the outcast catalog out outcast is one of those outcast was so big when i had to. spell outcast really with like an the actual word i would still do it. with a k and i'd be like wait. a minute that's not right. so that's how big they are outcast. discography all right so let's go through. the outcast discography here um in order right okay see now i'm pissed because it's not in order all right southern playalistic whatever that one was was great right stankonia was i don't oh and i was good aens was the [ __ ] atali was the [ __ ] dude but here's the deal i don't know we're not doing the discography but um once they got to. this song like i could handle like hey yah i could handle. right it was a a bop. once they got to. the one where they were like and the whole world. loves it when you play that song once. it got to. that one so alcast was really good. at making songs where i was like wow. all right okay and the second song. time i heard the song i was like okay. the third time i heard the song. i go all right this. a lot i don't know you know. that that hey the first time. he oh [ __ ] the second he oh third time. you're like uh this is it. really this is it huh. it's just a bop kind of okay. dude the [ __ ] hole in during that song i go all right. in the middle of the song. i go this is the most annoying. song i've ever heard in my life. my entire life okay. after the whole world l. it when you put that song. ha or whatever that song is i was done i was done with outcast and i go like this i don't know if i'm really an outcast guy big boy i could get behind andre i don't know if i could get behind it anymore. right then he was in a movie. with mark wahlberg and garrett hedland and i go you know. what dude i'm actually done is it. called four brothers or something. and then you didn't hear from andre. 3000 in a while and i was like that's dope. it's cool to fade. into oblivion i want to. do that i didn't make that. money yet though right. when i make that money then i will. people are so a lot of people are mad. i still do standup. comedy dude i tell you what give me a whole. bunch of money i'm done. haters fund me um so then he released. the flute thing and now. people are just like oh it remember when he was like traveling. around with the flute just in like new wherever. the [ __ ] he was people like oh this andre did had no idea and it would just viral. videos of him playing a flute every and everyone was like oh [ __ ] look at that. look at this guy just walking. this walking the earth just playing a flute like a [ __ ] cool. dude dude could you imagine like somebody. you didn't like starting to. do that you'd be like this. guy lost his mind. [ __ ] him okay so anyway he came out with this album 103,000 is releasing. his first album in over 17. years wow and look i get it. you don't want to. rap anymore i think that's cool god. bless but when guys get too. rich and too out. of touch and then they're like i'm going. to pick up a flute or start. collecting old cameras they're gone. man they're gone they're gone. dude imagine being around. somebody with a flute you know. look eight these are the track. lists um i swear i really wanted to. make a rap album but this is literally the way. the wind blew me this. time that's the first one. the second track is the slang word. i can't say it right. p ss y rolls off the tongue. with a far better ease. than the proper word vagina. do you agree that's the second tr. dude imagine being in concert. being like all right here's here's here's my next. one the slang word he rolls off. the tongue with far better. ease than the proper word vagina. do you agree dude. here here comes track three. the night in hawaii when i turned. into a panther and started making these low. register purring tones that i couldn't control [ __ ] was [music] wild. what there's another one. bipolo disorder's daughter wears a 3,000 button down. in bured uh wow so um look look at this. this new direction got the seal. of approval from friends. like tyler creator and frank. ocean although andre probably didn't need it. just he's just happy. when he's playing the flute yeah so like don't like do i tell you if i see a comedian. all of a sudden come out with like a rock. album you know or like they start. like doing something that's not comedy. no i'm telling them. oh yeah this sucks. dude i'm not frank frank. oing your [ __ ] if all of a sudden eric. griffin starts you know. what i mean
