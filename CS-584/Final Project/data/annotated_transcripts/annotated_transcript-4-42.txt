[ __ ] and i ordered uh i don't even remember what i ordered. but it was something. quick i was like i want to. order to get it here. quick i listen to. look oh this is going. to be here in 75 minutes. sometimes they're like this will be here. give it at least three and a half. hours and i ordered it. because it said like 25. to 35 minutes so i got it. and i'm waiting and i'm waiting and i'm waiting and it says your uber's. here collect your food. or your [ __ ] postmates here collect your food. i go outside guess what you know. no nowhere to [ __ ] be found he's not even in sight so i'm already pissed all right. but i calm down i try to. breathe i try to. check in with myself and i try to. relax and i think you know. what some things are beyond. people's control who knows. what happened this guy could have got carjacked for some [ __ ] fajitas so i walk outside. i don't see a trace of this. [ __ ] this guy is not down the street. and he's not up it. all right so i do something that i hate to. do as much as i love to. do i call the [ __ ] postmates. guy i hate doing it. because i don't want to. have to do it. but i love doing it. because i love being angry. dude and here we go. this is the angry olympics. for me this is the biathlon. of the angry olympics. for me getting a call the [ __ ] postmates. driver because there should never be a phone. call here there should never be a phone. call for a post based guy. i got the app if i want to. do a phone call i. call up domino's order. got that pizza or call. the restaurant directly and have him deliver. it but i didn't do. that because it got the app. housemates so instead of calling i use. the app now i got to. call the guy so i'm in the buy i'm in the biathlon. of the angry olympics. so i call him. and he picks up. great because most of the time. they don't even pick up. so my anger subsides a little bit and i say hello. i get nothing back and then i hear. and and then i i hear breathing. and then i say hello. and then i hear the first thing. that the guy says yeah i'm unloading. something okay so now i'm passed but even more. than that i'm very curious because in my book. the only thing you have to. unload is the goddamn fajitas to. my mouth please just unload the fajitas in my mouth. guy all right so i say oh you're you're what he says yeah. i'm i'm i'm up the street. i'm helping this guy unload something and now i think okay. i'm angry but let's put that. on the back burner because i need to. know what's happening because it must be serious. because he's not doing his job. he's not finished his job he's taken. on another job before. the first job was done. now he sounds mexican. and i know mexicans love to. work and that's how much they love to. work is that before the job. is up he's like let me. do another job so this way i'm doing two [ __ ] jobs at once so i look down the street first because that will make me less mad now. why will that make me. less mad because it means he didn't get to. my house yet so at least on the way. to my house something came up. and he decided to. be a good samaritan i guess. i can accept that so i looked down. the street nowhere to. be seen i look up. the street and i see a moving van so. now i'm like this [ __ ] is probably unloading. something out of that. moving van i guess but that means he passed my house. which means he could have dropped off. the [ __ ] fajitas to. my mouth and then helped whoever he needed. to but still i didn't know. what was going on and i'm on the phone. with them and i said hey you're the you're the postmates. driver i'm talking to. right because i wasn't sure i was 90. percent sure but that's not a hundred and i want to. be 100 sure that this. random number isn't is connected. to the post base app and i am calling the guy. that's trying to give me my. food so i say this. is the postmates guy. right and he says yeah like i'm the [ __ ] i said okay this is the other thing. too he's not saying enough. words do you know. what i mean like the only words. he said so far. is yeah i'm unloading. something and yeah those are the only words he said. and we've been on the phone. for like 25 seconds so i say okay. so you're unloading something where he says yeah i'm up. the street i'm helping these guys unload something so i'm like okay. are you bringing the food. and he says yeah honestly. i can't see it i can't. see the addresses because of the trees. ah you know how mad i am because you've listened to. this podcast 191 episodes he said yeah. but i can't see your address. because of the trees okay but also still do it. also use looking also when you drive by. look left you'll see those numbers. don't drive by so fast. i guess maybe look at every house's. number because every house has a number outside of it. maybe you're looking too hard. trying to find another job. before your first job is over so i'm like this. [ __ ] and i hear the door behind me. open and i'm like i'm already mad don't. add [ __ ] whoever this is it's either. calvin or kristen don't add. [ __ ] calvin can't reach a doorknob so alas it's kristen i turn around and she says what are you doing and i said okay well i explained what happened the guy [ __ ] he's unloading and he said he's unloading stuff she says unloading something and i says yeah i don't understand her she said well don't get mad and [laughter] i'm like all right okay you know but i gotta go up there to. see what the [ __ ] is going on and she says why and i was like because i i have to. know what the [ __ ] he's talking about because he's only said six words to. me and my fajitas are getting. cold she says all right so i'm walking. now and i only have shorts. on and i've got my long. feet flopping around dude i got long.

[ __ ] are dorks they're gonna be like uh well actually it's funny. to say that because there was a place. you know a lot of people think the hot. spot is roswell but in actuality it's somewhere. uh in northern dakota and there is footage. about no there's not dude. no there's not every [ __ ] every ufo that i've ever seen with the grain it. looks like a speck of something. in your teeth that's what it. looks like that's what it. always looks like when you first see something in someone's teeth. you're like is that is something. in their teeth or not. and then you look you're like oh yeah. something is in their teeth. or you're looking oh you never mind. i thought there was but there wasn't it's always that. oh yeah i thought that. was the word oh it [ __ ] stayed i was watching the [ __ ] show the other day and it was like the the ufo was up was was up. in the air and there was like this. is the most compelling ufo evidence that we've ever seen it stopped in the middle of the uh air and then it goes underwater and i'm like oh cool we get to. see this thing dive under water. dude it's so far away. it's this [ __ ] big it's this big and it's just sitting there it could be a [ __ ] a [ __ ] up on the film and then it just goes blunk into. the ocean i guess and some guy's always over. the thing just yeah that's a little real. there's yeah seeing it. going there it's got a it's at least. 900 knots it's going 70 not it's in it no there's no no no ship on the thing that could get closer it's just funny because i don't know how how close you can get if it's actually a an object that's out of this world that obviously came faster than the speed of light so do you tell me how a ship tanker can can catch up to. that unless we forget it's a ship. tanker uh we gotta can't get too. close i just i'm tired of it. dude everyone who posts all of the ufo [ __ ] the conspiracies theorists. you're so high all the time. you know what i'm talking. about like you're so high all. the time whoa like you ever. see joe rogan's post. you know what i mean. of a ufo he's like crazy.
