[ __ ] you just put two things together you know imagine figuring that out being the guy where you're just like you go down you go into. a plank you jump. up you go down you've core. there's nothing dude. also this guy's name is taco floor. what's wrong with everybody. taco floor is demonstrating the burpee. man everything's so [ __ ] crazy so look i did my netflix i've got a sub home specials everybody has i found it i there was employ at ikea. that's like edge is coming first. next flicks with netflix. petrol but they're hours. so my so i did it. and it's a it was a heist a halfhour it's the news. this new global thing that netflix. is doing which they're all releasing. at the same time and i'm excited about. and they asked me. to do it and i did. it because i've got a halfhour of material. that i don't mind burning. and i want to. not have it on my next. hour so i i did it. and the first taping we shoot. it you shoot these things. twice for those you guys that don't know. well if you're lucky issued these things twice. sometimes if you are shooting yourself you only do it once because it's more expensive the more time. you use and the more equipment. you use and the more shows. you do so shot it. twice and we did one. the first show what they did. is we shot three of them. together so it was me me it. they shot this episode. twice it was me. they're doing like 47 of these from. all around the world they got like comedians representing. brazil comedians representing french canada. regular canada asia and you know south africa america. and i was one of the comedians that. is representing america with neal brennan. and nicole byer and also nick swardson. now they coupled him up. differently so they put me nick swardson. and then k trevor noah. trevor kitchener wilson. i always do that trevor noah. is a comedian and and obviously the guy. that does the comedy. central daily show uh the one higher racking. up some points when i reckon up some points. gave me some [ __ ] told me. it was a good show. and but also a one fire. for interrupting but still helped so it's all good. so it's back to. zero let's just say so wha so it's okay. it's okay trevor wilson so it was us. three on that show and then neal brennan. neal brennan and nicole byer performed. it different than the night. doesn't matter it doesn't matter. it doesn't [ __ ] matter at all still just giving you the lowdown right so we went now the first show. was me then k trevor wilson. then nick swardson the second time we taped it. an hour later it was nick swardson. me then k trevor wilson. so the first show started. at seven o'clock now. i don't know you probably. don't know much about x and one shows starting. comedy the general rule is the later. shows are better unless they start at like 11:00. right because then people are drunk. as [ __ ] but the general rule is that this is the general i was gonna say and then i got sidetracked instead the thing about that later shows. if you're doing standup and it's still light. outside it's going to. be way tougher now seven o'clock in the summer. on montreal its way. north it's [ __ ] bright until like 8:30 alright so seven o'clock these guys piled in and i knew who's gonna. be kind of tight i had to. go first so i had to. kind of do that when they had a warmup but it wasn't it. but it was like still [ __ ] early i had to. go and the crowd was so tight. i couldn't [ __ ] believe it it was so tight i couldn't believe it sang a crowd is tight. means there [music] they're not. giving it up right. not laughing a lot. and it was tough dude. and i was like this. sucks that this is my netflix. taping so this and then i was like well maybe i'll at least warm. it up for the other guys. being a good person being really nice it's what. jesus would have done so then que trevor wilson. went up and it was [ __ ] tight. man and then nick swardson went up. and it was tight so we then we're like i don't. know again we did. it again and it was great. i [ __ ] it was an awesome show really happy. and props to the other guys. that did it with me. nick swardson it's [ __ ] hilarious que trevor wilson [ __ ] hilarious and i'm excited to. see them dude i'm excited to. have them come out and we'll see i don't know i get to. look at the edit today. actually they're gonna send it over. so that should be out i think early. next year anyway be on the lookout. for that that's it i don't know. where 18 minutes in 19. minutes in got nothin else. to talk about yeah oh no i do actually when i was in montreal. by the way here's two things. happen in montreal right. after my netflix taping okay. walked out some guy you know we walk out. especially the comedy festival. there's lots of comedy. fans so they'll recognize you more so i was walking down. the street this is one. long one one street that everything's on st. catherine. i think it's called anyway. i walk down the street. and some guy says chris d'elia. you mispronounced my name i don't remember how but i was like yeah almost what's up. and he said i just wanted to. shake your hand shakes my hand. this guy was a one of those guys that like you could tell he worked. out a lot but he was also one of those fat workout guys you know what i'm talking about where it's like oh [ __ ] stop eating carbs if you want a good body maybe you don't maybe you just want to. be beefy you want to. be those one of those guys. that [ __ ] you know carries. tires around outside instead of that you know. you want to. be one of those

love going to. get the [ __ ] huntergatherers [ __ ] right that's what that is how crazy is it that now it turned into. that oh mama has so many. tchotchkes i i [ __ ] hate tchotchkes man when i was a kid i like like i i collected [ __ ] like you know first of all i collected baseball cards and i also collected comic books but beyond that like any time there was something cool like i remember one of the things i had were fra i like and when mcdonald's or some like fast food company would do like these like promotional things for movies i remember there was one for batman forever and they had like happy meals or even though there weren't even happy meals but they were like because i don't think i'd get happy meals but they were like the fry covers would be like the penguin or like the riddler or like batman robin and i would get them and i'd always want them different one that i didn't have and i'd get them and i saved them like my fry holders and i would save [ __ ] like that like i got into. pogs remember pogs we'd. [ __ ] slam him i collected um i had sheets of pogs. i collected so many [ __ ] dumb things. man like i was a real sentiment i'm still sentimental. but i was a sentimental kid. so i'd keep all the kid. [ __ ] and then one day i looked at my desk and i was like oh no dude. i'm gonna be a hoarder i literally thought that i don't even know if i knew what a hoarder was but i was i'm gonna be one of those pack rat [ __ ] that just has a bunch of [ __ ] and and i'm gonna [ __ ] keep keep too much. [ __ ] and what by the time. i move out of my parents. house i'm gonna be like a mess i'm never gonna get chicks they're gonna be like it this. is a nice place. where do i step. right and so i with one fell swoop. i was like if i don't throw away. all this [ __ ] right now i'll never do it so i threw all and i lo and one of the things was i looked the fry holders and it were all old and greasy with the [ __ ] fry it was gross. so i was like there's gonna i'm gonna throw him away. throw all the way. i never collected a thing. after that it was like a [ __ ] purge dude. it was awesome and now i'm a better. person because of that you got to. realize we got early on. or otherwise you [ __ ] if you too late. you're [ __ ] you're already set in your ways. baby you have to. be a selfreflective 12. year old guess what it's too. late for you you're done. [ __ ] up and so am i we're all [ __ ] in our own way we're all a certain kind of [ __ ] up figuring it out we're trying but you know and we think we all have it figured out too even if we say we don't we still [ __ ] secretly think we have it figured out for a moment a moment that's so [ __ ] maybe it's all i thought at the whole. or like i don't know but moments a moment. we're like [ __ ] sure [ __ ] i try to. keep my ocd at bay. you know it's tough you know. i told you that jojo's cup story it. manifests itself in weird ways and it wasn't even. that i wanted jojo's this was a those you that don't know. this it's on an earlier episode. called jojo's cup but it wasn't even in it wasn't even a a german. thing mine has nothing to. do with germs it was a that's her cup that's designated for. her i don't use it. it's a weird [ __ ] thing i don't take drinks from other people's drinks. i'll eat a sandwich i'll take a bite from their [ __ ] but for some reason. i got a locked in my head. i don't do that and it. has nothing to. do with germs i mean. it does if you look like a [ __ ] if you got like you know gross. [ __ ] mouth going on then am i and you keep it you know but uh yeah it's [ __ ] weird how a mental [ __ ] can affect you right i think about that a lot lately actually like leaders how they can like make like it cuz i was watching the sacha baron cohen thing which is amazing who is america and i'm like how the [ __ ] do they get these people to. do this man how funny was the roy moore one were they [ __ ] you saw it where they were like the guy like [ __ ] wandered him and there was a pedophile one and it went off and then roy moore was like i've never ever been like called been accused of such a thing and it's like haha yes you have by nine people it's google it you're you you definitely know about it that's how you know he's lying cuz you lied. about that i've never been accused really google. it nine nine kids at mooney wrote. away and his horse that. little bitchass god if you're gonna ride. a horse you better.

okay. cool this is a good question. vincent let's lit our dawn a say italian. what do you do. to get through nights where you. feel anxious or not mentally. prepared to perform. but still have to. um well you know what i have. a [ __ ] saying well it's not even a saying but it's something i realized the first time i did an actual show and i did standup i did had done open mikes but i hadn't done an actual real show and i invited. some of my friends it was my first. like real actual show and how many times i say that. but um i didn't understand. i was so nervous and anxious. i was like i got to. go onstage but how am i gonna get offstage i'll get up on stage when they call my name and i literally thought okay if i could just move each leg in front of each other one at a time i'll eventually i'll be on stage and then people will be looking at me and i'll be have to. talk i'll have to. start talking so i focused. on just moving one of my legs. at a time which is so dumb. but it worked and that brought me around. to thinking about how all you it's all. your body like even if you're anxious. i mean sometimes your anxiety. is out of control. i get it mine is. too every now and then but like it. is your body and i think you can control. it by trying to. calm yourself down now that doesn't mean. can you control 100% no. of course not but like i used to. go to therapy for years. and my therapist would say i used to. get so anxious flying i don't anymore. but she would be like all you have to. do is concentrate on relaxing like. you're not as relaxed as you think. you are like if you think about your body. right now think about where your body. is right now whatever you're doing. even if you're sitting down or whatever. think about the muscle. that you're using right now. you're probably you're probably your abs. are probably a little bit you. know tight because you're sitting up. maybe you're you know your legs. across and you're using one. leg to put to. use you're you're forcing one. leg to go on top. of the other one maybe you're you. know you're [ __ ] holding a cup of coffee. or whatever that whatever it is. you don't realize using those muscles. if you focus i used to. focus on each body part. of mine i used to. focus on my calves my feet. then i would move up. from there my my [ __ ] my quadriceps my hamstrings i would i would sit and i would relax. and i would breathe and i would concentrate on breathing. through it and relaxing each one. of those body parts i get to. my enormous [ __ ] i i try to. relax my [ __ ] you know what i mean. not by massaging it just by. breathing to be like relax. my [ __ ] relax my big huge [ __ ] boulder. balls then i get into. my my abs and they're always tight. now that's why like always got the [ __ ] black diamond. course it's like you know. they're always draw a card is very hard to. relax my abs i would do that. i concentrate on my [ __ ] my chest my [ __ ] crazy crazy [ __ ] rip the ridiculous chest and you know what there's a really nice separation between my chest and my soldiers so i try to. [ __ ] you know relax the striations on my shoulders and we're gonna do this and i would do that you know and then i would get to. my [ __ ] tongue which [ __ ] dances around a woman's mouth when i kiss her like it's just crazy you know what i mean and and i'd relax it and then i would get more relaxed and the anxiety. would go away it would it would go away. sometimes it would go away. completely man but my therapist would always be like it's your body. you can just do what. you have to. do by trying to. breathe through it and she was right. for me no granted i'm not. the most anxious person in the world. but i think it could help. for you did i used to. concentrate every body part and then i would be not so anxious. being on the airplane and it worked. even relaxing my [ __ ] enormous [ __ ] how about well he was a ginormous god that's so boring okay next you know that it well you know what guys a little bit serious. on you there who's gonna join. the space force is what i want. to know trump's a space. force ivan gets rid of razors. head that would be great. if one of you guys would would be and his space. force that's it literally sounds like a joke. movie in the 80s that [ __ ] rick moranis would be in and the guy from ernest goes to. do the ernest movies or whatever. space force and don john candy. would be the lead i'm naming. all the guys in space. balls it's not creative. it's like when you [ __ ] what my buddy. kt tatara has a joke. about how when gross. give you the number they're gonna give you the wrong. number they're not he's like people aren't creative. enough to come up with a whole different. number they always give you the first. eight digits of their number and then the last digit. is the wrong one. she just keep guessing this. you know like nobody's ever like nine. four seven two seven four four seven. they're always do their number whatever. it is it's like 3 2. 3 4 4 5 4 5. 4 4 4 5 5 and then the last number. is different whatever i thought it. was a funny [ __ ] bit i died maybe you don't like it i i he's funny. alright did pieces of [ __ ] what do you want from me you got a [ __ ] ya know [ __ ] yeah dude i we were at that there was a just for last party or no party i just for laughs and the [ __ ] what do you call it and just for laughs in montreal and there was a trutv party and they got and they were like it's the trutv party and all they had were bagels and like one piece of meat in it like it was so sad dude it was like come on trutv you're really trying to. really trying to. get going with your [ __ ] network and they give us [ __ ] sesame bagels with [ __ ] one slice of turkey in it and we're like this is a party maybe they paid for the bar tab i don't know but maybe they didn't do it so they have that impractical jokers dude they're [ __ ] killing. it they do they didn't know. apparently they were like let's try. to do a live show. they did a live show. and they sold out. an arena that's how big the show. wasn't they had no [ __ ] idea yep they're huge those guys are [ __ ] rolling in it those guys are loaded. as [ __ ] there's four rooms so if they have to. split it that's why i do my podcast. by myself man i want that brinks truck dude i'm not trying to. split it [ __ ] this fighter. in the kid [ __ ] oh they got a split at dude. the [ __ ] out of here. they're always like our podcast. is bigger than yours. and i'm like yeah cool you got to. yeah split it [ __ ] i [ __ ] make more than you because of that that's what's up. dude i don't know if i do or not but split. your [ __ ] money you [ __ ] fifty twoyearold kalen brendan schaub you big bully. i love those guys man. i'm gonna [ __ ] take that belt. away from theo dude you just watch i'm gonna melt it. down and make him some [ __ ] nice earrings dude. i'm gonna take that belt that.
