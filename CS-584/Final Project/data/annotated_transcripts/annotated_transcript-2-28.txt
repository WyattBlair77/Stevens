really know much about cincinnati. i've been there once been to. columbus maybe two times you know. um and uh went to. columbus guess what it was. fine went to cincinnati. and it was absolutely absolutely it. was absolutely banging so the guy. it doesn't know and that's okay. because we all have different opinions right. we do we all have different. opinions and that's fine but let me tell you something. dude the first time. look the shows were of course the shows. were banging right because you know. white guy if i fill the seats. people [ __ ] sit down they don't sit down for too long because they got to. jump up because they get so exciting. the [ __ ] start climbing to. go oh yeah i guess. um columbus uh they go like this. my crew uh denny uh well actually no they weren't. even with us at that. point um but uh sam camera guy uh my buddy. who uh rose with me does all. the the tour vlogs by. the way uh and um chris marco. my buddy came with me and then also david sullivan. came with me the fat guy. so we we david's like hey man. let's do the [ __ ] by the way uh david sullivan came with me he's an actor he's in stuff you gotta watch him on fatal attraction. watch fatal attraction on paramount plus. uh it's a it's a good. show i'm into. it for a show look. i'm gonna be honest. for sure don't talk donkey balls. but then i got into. it right i want there. to be more of david. he's good i wish it. was a me it was the lead. guy first episode suck donkey balls. and then it got good. okay episode two i was like i don't know episode. three i'm in but what does paramount. plus do dude they make you wait. every week for a new episode. so i'm pissed right. because remember when they invented streaming. that took that all out and now streaming is going. back to oh we're gonna leak. it out once a week and i'm just like dude. streaming lasts for like [ __ ] five years. and now they're going back. to every week is a new episode. like i had to. deal with this [ __ ] with uh uh uh the [ __ ] zombie. one that everyone's saying is the next the last. of us with pedro pascal. um so david sullivan is an actor he's a successful. actor loves coming on the road with us. just likes doing it you know. why he's running for something. we don't know what but he's absolutely. running from something okay he loves you. know what he loves uh moving. and shaking right like he's just like uh i you'll just be like dude. uh skeeball all right man. i found two play i found two places. and you're like how i just looked it. up you're like i mentioned it. point five seconds ago. you'll be like uh uh bumper. cars i man there's a place. it's not 25 minutes ago. so anyway uh we do this. and we get there and by the way. but before i even get into. that part this what we did. with exploring the cities uh david i always say. how he's fat okay. he's that's just the joke. i don't even know why. i started saying it me. and my brother started saying it. uh he's just a 46. year old guy it's there's no he's just a guy if you think of a guy who's 46. and then his a guy's body who's 46. that's david's body guy he's got guy. body right you know is he shredded. no he's got guy body right. so so he's got his guy body the whole time. right and i talk about how fat he is. and [ __ ] like that and he's like do you cut do you say i'm fat. on your podcast i'm like why. because people [ __ ] comment on my instagram and so so i say to. him uh so so he's doing he just comes. and he goes and he works. the merch booth just because he wants to. right because running from something. dude okay but he's like i just worked him. and he'll be texting me. man i'm sweating out here. i got some water thing. and uh dude so he says uh so he's out. there does the marching and he says man. people come up to. me and he said hey hey you're not you're not fat. and as he says you say i'm fat. a lot and i do oh yeah. all the time bro. you got guy body dude. i know people say dad bot. i don't like that because dad bought to. me evokes like kind of a little bit. fatter guy body is worse. like guy body is worse. because it's on the way. to fat and it's like figure it out. you know what i'm saying like every nobody not everybody. could have a [ __ ] movie set on the back. of their shoulders right they can't. they can't they can't they can't. carry camera crew like your boy. does right everybody's [ __ ] tummy can't be a [ __ ] mini ski slope black diamond level. right it can't right. can everybody's just have striations. no david's got guy body. so it's all good and um so anyway he does. this thing where he's like hey man. you ever beat on those. lime scooters and i was like what truth. be told i did lime. scooters once uh in uh parking lot. of coffee bean. and tea leaf and i put one foot on. it and i hit the [ __ ] you know the just a little bit early. and it just shot out. from under me i almost fell down. i didn't but so we can't really count. it as an accident but i'm

remarking this. oh boy um we're gonna mark it. it's a clip of a video from a campaign. event in west palm beach on october 13. 2016 and we're going to. mark it as djt 36. where's. the part where he does. the thing you know what i'm talking. about have you seen. it no no hold on. then there was a writer from people magazine. oh boy oh boy yeah. oh about to. be off the rails. on our first anniversary. the story was beautiful it was that after 12. years this took place 12 years. ago this story a new claim that. i made inappropriate advances during. the interview to. this writer well i mean dude. playing the crowd so hard. people grabbing [ __ ] while they're doing no 200 isn't it here 20. 20 or 12 years ago. why was it a part. of the story why didn't they make it. part of the story i was one. of the biggest stars on. television yeah and it would. have been one of the biggest stories of the year. think of it she's doing this. story on melania who's pregnant. at the time and donald trump. our one year anniversary said i made inappropriate. advances and by the way the area. was a public area. people all over all right. let's go with me that. the person you were just talking about in that video was natasha. storing off correct yes are you. familiar with a woman by the name of jessica leeds. just no i don't think so explain. go ahead does that mean. that this refresh your recollection. yeah this woman made up a story just like your client. made it up yeah just made up a story having to. do with sitting me in it. sitting next to. me in an airplane. era airplane and i mean i'll have to. read this again but that story was so false. also but this was i guess making out as opposed to. what your client said this. story was so false this. is a disgrace also and do you recall. speaking about ms leeds. allegations at campaign events. in 2016. i might have i thought it was so come. on where's the part. why do they make it. seven minutes okay when you said. in that video that that. would not be your first. here it is here it. is you were referring to. her physical looks correct. just the overall not i i look. at her i see her i hear what she says. whatever you wouldn't be a choice. of mine either to be honest. with you i hope you're not insulted. i would not under any circumstances. have any interest in it. keeps going keep going i'm being i'm
