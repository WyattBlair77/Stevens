 [music] hey this is episode. i don't even know anymore. of [music] congratulations [music]. yeah yeah yeah dude it's uh uh another episode. you know um uh whoops. stay on page here i gotta i almost clicked out. of the whole [ __ ] thing timing how long i'm supposed. to do it because we're flying. by the seat of our pants. on this episode i'll tell you but i actually i will. say this it's not that. we're flying by the seat. of our pants but it's that. it's uh it's [ __ ] 10 46. right now doing this. so this is a late night. one so you never know. sometimes they go off the rails. and off the rails. uh can be a good thing. but it can also be a [ __ ] dangerous thing. for me as i've learned. in the last few months. um anyway i uh i do you know. you do you [ __ ] selfreflect man. you do you live life. you don't think you stop you [ __ ] think and you figure it out uh if you know what's good for you anyway. uh one of the things i [ __ ] figured out is and and check this [ __ ] out for real your boy and by your boy i mean me can cut his own. [ __ ] hair and i can do it all the day as long and i can do it like the dickens. and i can do it better. than the [ __ ] people who cut hair sorry the people who cut hair i appreciate you i enjoyed sitting in your hair in your chairs for all of the [ __ ] years i even enjoyed getting my haircut. when i was a kid. from that guy named tony that. would [ __ ] my dad would bring him and asked my dad once while he was cutting. the back of my hair. you want a rattle and i s and my dad. said huh and he said you want. to retail and my dad. said no and i didn't know what the hell. tony was [ __ ] saying and then when i got home i asked dad. hey dad what the [ __ ] did that. guy say and he said do you want. to for me to. cut a [ __ ] rat tail in your son's head. hey tony no i was eight. you want a tail and then i rewound it. in my head you know. how you can do that. i rounded it in my head. and and i realized she said you want. to retail do you want. to retail dude do you want to. retail uh anyway dude i cut my own. hair man and it is [ __ ] good. and i'm i'm i'm the kind of guy. if i suck at something. i will tell you dude. like um splitting atoms i can't do that. you know but i can [ __ ] cut my own. hair or or not being selfish. i'm bad at that but i'm working on. it dude and i'm better. now than i was you know. i'm not doing all the selfish. things i'm [ __ ] trying to. live for other people and i have a [ __ ] son now so anyway my point is i could cut my own hair. and it [ __ ] looks banging. dude did you know. that oh you do now. man because you could see me. and i look look at what i take. this off dude forget. it it gets a little okay. so here's the thing though. i cut it and when i cut it. by the way the best thing. about cutting your own. hair and this is for the guys. because i don't think girls can do that. [ __ ] i mean that you can do it of course equal opportunity. i get it i don't want to. get cancelled again but my point. is that girls shouldn't cut their own. hair because girls have a lot. of hair and girls hair. is like an outfit you know. what i mean like girls. will be like what kind of hair. do i want today and you'll be like oh you can just change like you're a [ __ ] action figure but girls can just cut their [ __ ] or no i'm sorry i cut their [ __ ] but they could put it up they could put it down they could put it sideways they could do a beehive they could put a little house in it and a bird can land. in it they can do whatever. the [ __ ] they want and change the whole getup. guys pretty much just have standard. hair so what you can. do as a guy is just [ __ ] take your time you know what i'm talking about girls. bunch up their hair getting done. all in [ __ ] well i don't know my fiance will be like i'm going to. get my hair hair done i'm like really why are you bringing. a [ __ ] sleeping bag she's like it takes three days you know you're so [ __ ] i girls will wake up at [ __ ] oh dark 30 and go to. get their hair cut and come back. after [ __ ] dinner time and they're like do you like it and it looks exactly. the same you know oh yeah yeah yeah it's good yes it's a little darker. right it's blonder uh so i meant. blunder right it's blonder and you cut it. shorter right yes of course because why would how could you get it. longer well you have extension you have extensions. oh okay cool so extensions. and blonder great um how about the fact that you can. go and sit in a chair. and just make your hair longer. too that's that's that's not scientifically. possible but girls made it possible. and so um so guys you could spread that [ __ ] three hours out you know when i would go get my hair cut they would do it in like 30. minutes or sometimes if i got chatty. you know they they'd like your boy's personality. and it would take 50 to. 60 minutes right um with tony. though was just get in cut it. get out right you want a retail. no thank you here's 16. bye dad what do. you say yes if you wanted a rat tail. let's never go back to. him again so i um i spread it. out dude i do a little [ __ ] snip here and a little snip there dude i do a little snip here little snip there i go top snip side snip snip did i [ __ ] make one side longer than the other i pull it out oh it's a little longer snip snip i go have a bite come back catch myself in the mirror wait a second do a little back track grab the [ __ ] scissors nearby i keep the scissors near every mirror snip snip snip at the end of all of it which is like you know i do this maybe every month and a half. and it takes [ __ ] four days to. cut hair i look i look really good you know. uh from the front you know. what i'm talking about look. really good from the front. because i realized i i saw a picture of me. from behind me and the [ __ ] just looks like the back. of a [ __ ] skunk's ass because i it dude. it pops i didn't re. i forgot not that i forgot. to cut the back but i thought i was getting it. you know it's really hard. to cut the back of your hair. unless you're [ __ ] you can't hold the mirror and look in the mirror. at the other mirror and have the scissors. i thought you could but who holds. the [ __ ] hair and i won't let kristen help. because then i didn't do it. myself do you understand. what i'm saying so your boy. cuts his own hair and this is how it looks and no disrespect. to all the people who [ __ ] i sat in your chair but i know my hair better dude you know when you're done [ __ ] if you're a guy cut your own hair i heard george clooney did it probably 20 years. ago and i always thought about that. and now i'm [ __ ] i swear to. god i'm like basically george clooney in that in that. area i'm drinking coffee uh at 10. 48 at night and i can drink. coffee late at night. and then conk out um but yeah it. doesn't really affect me. and it's annoying when people say that. because they're always trying to. impress you when they say that. but i'm not trying to. impress you what i'm trying. to say is if i drink celsius celsius fit or celsius. live fit or celsius. heat i'm off the rails. i'm like sonic the hedgehog. looking for coins. man i'm and i'm nuts. when i do it i'm nuts. and that's when i work out i take a celsius heat. and then i start working out. and dude my back when i [ __ ] work my back out. and i check myself in the mirror. it looks like i'm just storing captain america's. shield ready for battle. casually you know he wears it on the back. i don't know if you know. that he's not always [ __ ] ready. for battle but he's got it. on his back i'm like a turtle um yeah so i cut my own. hair and uh and that's just basically how it's to. be now until i die. i'll i'll probably lose it you know. i thought i was thinning. a little bit and then i realized it. doesn't matter at all who gives a [ __ ] [ __ ] my dad would always say to. me when i was a kid. you know some guys go bald. that's the only thing you have to. worry about who cares. if you go bald just you go bald. and i was like yeah and i thought maybe that's not right. and then i realized who gives a [ __ ] [ __ ] man just get your family. wife the [ __ ] up have a few kids. and go bald it's better. then you don't have to. worry about it that's the only thing. a [ __ ] guy has to. worry about unless you're famous. um so uh but yeah so i i cut my own. hair um and uh i felt a little rusty. i didn't know if i felt rusty. or what when i was doing. my podcast um you know every now and then i'll go on a run. and i'll forget something. and i'll be like what was i going. to talk about and i wonder if that would be me. being rusty because i tell you what man. over the past however. many months i have not felt. funny dude you know. how to make someone not. feel funny [ __ ] bash him online so so much you take a thick. skin [ __ ] that thought he built up some [ __ ] over the bomb years. of stand up when you just bomb. and you're like well i'm strong. i don't care what people. say about me and then you have the whole world. saying something about you and you're like okay. i was i thought i was strong. but instead i'll die. instead i'll die i kept thinking [ __ ] every. time i would catch something. online or my buddy said oh i saw this. about you or whatever. i had that [ __ ] that meme guess i'll die. now that old guy. with the [ __ ] red turtleneck guess. i'll die that was me. um but yeah so so you just don't feel funny. man i'm on the group. test texts trying to. [ __ ] do jokes with my buddies. i'm like nah that's not. working i don't do i don't know. i don't i don't do twitter or [ __ ] [ __ ] anymore. i don't do the i didn't do. the podcast so i was just like let me just do a funny voice. note and i was just on my of it. [ __ ] me up and then and then now i feel you know doing my podcast i didn't know if it was rusty or not i heard [ __ ] pilots are crashing because they're not even they don't fly anymore. because of the covet [ __ ] they're like getting all. laid off and not used. for months and then they're like yeah oh a job. great showing up to. the [ __ ] cockpit all drunk didn't think they had to. do it mask hanging off. their ear i'm ready wrong hat. on it's hey where's your pilot's cap. is that it pulls it off. as a [ __ ] tampa bay uh uh it's a [ __ ] devil. raised hat sorry i got the wrong. hat anyway [ __ ] what's up okay wheels up what is up. um and they're crashing and doing like all sorts. of [ __ ] up [ __ ] man i don't know man i don't know if i would take a flight now i don't i don't want to. be going anywhere because i'm scared. of a little bit of covid. and here's the other thing. too man i'm not scared. of dying i don't want to. get sick dude i'd rather. just chill and wait the [ __ ] out i don't want to. get sick man people are like oh you're scared. of covid bro i don't want. the flu i don't want a cold. i just don't want to. feel [ __ ] shitty um yeah so my uh what happened with my son today. what happened with my son. today callie's cute he still. won't say ball i tell him. to say ball he won't say ball. but you know he waves. at everybody i told you that. already but also he'll give the ball. to one of our one of our dogs. one of our shitty dogs. he'll give the ball to. one of our shitty dogs. and our dog will be like is is this. okay like he's looking at me. can i take this from the new guy. and and cal kelly's just like you. know he he doesn't even. know what he's doing but he's like this. is a thing that you can. do in life and they'll hand. the ball to. the [ __ ] to. our one of our shitty. dogs and our shitty dog will just be like it's cool. it's like the guy who's going. for seconds at like a free. buffet just like is did everyone got their everyone got their stuff. right it's gonna go to. waste okay see you later. and then runs off and pisses on. the [ __ ] corner of the couch our dogs. won't stop pissing on the corner. couch really cool uh i'm gonna [ __ ] piss on how about this dude. i'm gonna piss on the corner. of the couch to.

[ __ ] go to in the morning. and one of the guy. and i was like i can't i ca sorry. i didn't make it cause i. overslept and he's it's at nine and he's like what do you mean. it's [ __ ] nine he's like don't you have a [ __ ] eight month old whatever he was back then and i was like yeah and i felt like i was lying i felt i felt like i was like when i used to. [ __ ] cheat i'm like well no he's okay. i was sleeping and it's all good. because of the [ __ ] i he sleeps late. look and i took a screenshot. of him sleeping on the [ __ ] when he woke up on the nan it and i sent it over i'm like i i just i anyway um so yeah so i figured this out so i used to. i woke up at i used to. i know i wake up sometimes. 7 30 sometimes i wake up at 5. 00 sometimes i wake up. at 3 30. sometimes 1 2 1 20. i'll wake up i'll fall asleep. at midnight and at 1. 20 i'll wake up and i'll be like i got to. pee so [ __ ] bad and i'm like i just peed at 12. 11 59 a peek and i started to. sleep at 120 i pee. so i'm mad now because i got to. wake up to piss right. and i'm so pissed off. and i did the thing where i was like [ __ ] it i'm gonna go just back. to sleep and i'm just gonna have. to pee and sleep. through it that's my penance you know my body's. changing now [ __ ] you body i got this i'm going to. stay asleep and then go back. to sleep sure enough. i couldn't do it because you know. when you got to. pee you got to. pee so i would wake up. i would go pee wake up. trying to turn the light. on find the toilet go. back by the time i come back. my heart's beating because i'm mad as [ __ ] cause now i'm a guy that wakes up in the middle. of night to. be right so now i'm like what am. i gonna do because my body is betraying me. do you understand me. so i i ordered on amit because i went i wanted. to go get him. but i was like maybe i shouldn't go. get him because if i go out. in public someone might take a picture. and be like hey i spotted chris lee i haven't seen him in a long time and look what he's buying. so instead i [ __ ] got it sent from amazon. and they showed up to. the house i opened up the box. and my girl said what's that. and i said well kristin. they're depends and i got a whole mess. of them dude and i got smalls i know. you're probably thinking but he's not small. i'm not small but i am small. for a 90 year old okay. your boy where smalls depends so dude. i got them and i [ __ ] i tonight is the first night. i'm gonna wear those [ __ ] and i'm gonna piss the bed. dude i'm gonna piss the bed. and i win body i win. my body betrayed me. well guess what dude. i'm gonna use my mind. to trump my body so now my body. and my mind are both back. on my side i win. i figured it out. i'm elon musk of pissing pants. go ahead [ __ ] take cars. to space figure out. how to make hoverboards without people dying. i figured out how to. piss the bed in a cool. fashion as a 40. year old and i'll tell you what too. [music] i realized this because once. when i was 30. as a joke somebody got me. a bunch of depends and i went hahaha. very funny and i stored them. off to the side. and i didn't throw them. away and i didn't know why. but a few months. later my buddy was over and he was like why do you have the pens and i told him the story of it. somebody made a joke. and then [ __ ] bought me the depends and i paused i realized why the [ __ ] haven't i not tried this so i put the depends on when i was 30 and i pissed now i'm assuming mostly all of my listeners have never pissed and depends well when you piss and depends it's like your dick coughs liquid isn't even around. it's not like oh so it. absorbs the liquid it's like no it's so it it's it's like the [ __ ] liquid just comes out. as it's amazing the diaper. gets heavy and it's a little warm. but it does not feel. like liquid so i can't wait to. piss the bed tonight and kristen. is like what the [ __ ] i don't want. to you know [music]. my fiance is like you're going. to just piss the bed. and i'm like yup. and guess what dude. i'm not this is not negotiable. because my body betrayed me. you should be on my team. are you on my team. are you my body's. team so she's like all right. she rolls her eyes. she's like you better not get pissed. on the bed i'm not going. to get pissed off. a bit because i pissed. i used to. depends when i was 30. i tried. it they don't even leak. down the leg dude i'm not. bullshitting you man this. is not a [ __ ] comedy. bit you piss and depends it's like you're not pissing so um i'm gonna do it. dude my body ain't [ __ ] dude. i tell my body what goes on. it's your body be in control. of your body if you can't. do it physically then get depends and make sure you [ __ ] can handle

practically. i'm in boiler room i'm in that. movie boiler room um and bitcoin's crazy. right i can't believe these [ __ ] cryptocurrencies i've never said that. word until right now um oh you know what happened. my [ __ ] remember the dog. that my mom thought got [ __ ] lenny remember she i told you this. on the podcast before when she was like oh my brother. would pet anytime someone would pet lenny on his butt. lenny would go like and my mom. would and my mom my mom. would literally she would literally she literally said you know. why that he does you. know why i think he does. that and we said what he said. i think somebody but [ __ ] him that's what my mom. said to the family. at dinner i think somebody [ __ ] him my mom said that. okay and i know i've said this. before on the podcast. but i need to. say that again well apparently it served. lenny well that rough upbringing. getting [ __ ] and whatnot. by the way i was like you mean. like a dog [ __ ] would like [ __ ] lenny and my mom said no i think like his previous owner. my mom because my brother. pet lenny and lenny went my mom my human. mom jumped skyrocketed to. the conclusion that the dog. used to have an owner. that would butt [ __ ] him on a regular basis okay okay so that's a that's a real thing so that happened at dinner okay so that dog apparently growing. up growing up rough dude. he got attacked by a coyote and lenny up apparently went. back into his [ __ ] enough's enough. you know what i mean. i won't take it. anymore and bit the [ __ ] tail off. of the coyote and the coyote ran away. lenny what coyote get off of me. get off of me. raj you know what i mean or whatever the [ __ ] is previous just a flashback and bit the tail off the coyote my dad saw the coyote running away with no tama that's like what the [ __ ] and lenny was sitting there just like wheezing and puncture wounds but with that [ __ ] coyote tail and my brother said i want that took the tail and is gonna frame it my whole. family's crazy okay and so lenny's okay. now he was wobbling dude. like this just [ __ ] wobbling back and my butt. my dad was just like oh bro. so upset man uh yeah yeah so lenny's okay now so whatever happened to. lenny in the past whatever. it was whatever made him growl. because my brother pet him. on the back uh served. him well against that coyote so here's to. lenny huh it's tough when a [ __ ] dog you don't think about it. like my dogs basically just [ __ ] and piss i don't even really know they're there a lot of the time like i'm like wait a second but they ran away. once and i was [ __ ] man. like you take them for granted. because they're just around. and you get mad when they piss on the [ __ ] couch or or sn or snap at you you know you're like hey hey you got it good um and uh yeah so [ __ ] they uh they ran away once and i was calling out for them all [ __ ] night dude and it was just it's brutal man it sucks we found them they came back like they went on [ __ ]
