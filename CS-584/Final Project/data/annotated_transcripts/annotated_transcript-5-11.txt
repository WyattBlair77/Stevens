[music] dude my favorite thing is to. think of drake being like here we go. he's walking through the thing. and he's like here we go. i see the [ __ ] guys and with all the microphones and everything like that and i and i like to. imagine he was like i'm gonna do my chips. thing like on the way. to the game he was like if they win. i'm gonna do that chips. with the dip thing like he's just with this. girl or with some homies. and he's just like driving to. the game being driven to. the game and they're like yo. drake just maybe the [ __ ] this may. be the time where they went. and they haven't won in a while and he'll be like yup. they're like they're gonna obviously. interview you he's like yeah and he's like what you gonna. say he's like i got it. all sorted no worry i got it. all sorted cuz you know. they brought a chip to. the city if they went right. and the dudes were like oh yeah and they don't know. but they're saying yes because they're in drake's. camp and you don't say no. to drake and he was like yeah. you're like alright well i'm just gonna mit. i'm just gonna go on like this. did this chips run. you know well i say how he brought a chip to. the city and i'm gonna start. talking about it and they're like yeah. that's right that's dope dog. and then he [ __ ] came up and did this [ __ ] [music] i know [music] you know what's funny is so to. bring them tips so bring them. tips dude you know what's funny. is and i made a [ __ ] meme of it. and i made the first one and then people [ __ ] kind of ripped. it all off and [ __ ] and about the [ __ ] i said hello welcome to. applebee's can i take your order. and then he [ __ ] can i have it welcome. to applebee's kennedy ordered [music]. dude it's so it's either he set it. up but i don't think actually. he decided on saying it while he was driving to. the [ __ ] game i think it took him offguard and he was like they brought a chip to. the city and since you know his music. is like so like you know. in rap there's so many metaphors and he's like a pretty [ __ ] hardcore metaphor. guy and so he was like he said the chips. thing and then he was like i want my chips. with the dip and then there's a little flicker of like oh i don't know what the [ __ ] this wasn't the best. analogy but what i really. like about drake is he doesn't back. down he said i don't want my chips. plane i want my chips. with the dip and then further furthered it and said so bring them. dips which was just in [ __ ] incredible. dude i'm on my chips. with the dip that's all i know so bring them. dips oh my god dude i know. so bring them dips. and then dude wow what a kawaii why. does kawaii look like you just watched. [ __ ] seven documentaries. in a row always looks like he just watched. like like seven hardcore documentaries. where everyone gets cancer. and he's just like there. was a meme where he was where they took a picture. of him and he was like and everyone was cheering. everyone was like excited that. they won the championship. and his face was just chilling. and then and somebody wrote man. kawaii just are already forgot that he want. but like he's so in his head. dude but dude god bless [music]. let's see how it keeps you. [music] maybe and the big mommy [music]. you know what it means did. he just talk he ever know. what he's saying what does. it mean it's not about what. it means what do you. mean dude it's not about what. it means he brought a chip to. the city dude of course it's about what it. means he's just so amped you know. what's funny is all the fame. all the [ __ ] money all the [ __ ] like your inner dork will always shine through you know and everybody has some sort of version. of their inner dork but it. always will come out if you're too excited. i don't know what mine is. mine is not basketball for sure. but it's so funny dude. i guess the championship is a chip i want. my chip i don't know. what it means people on my app. are like chips means championship. i [ __ ] love drake dude. that new song with chris. brown who beats the [ __ ] on a woman. that that [ __ ] song it's ok everyone's talking about is the new anthem. of the summer and it's ok it's ok but also [ __ ] oj's on twitter which is crazy. and how many followers does oj have on twitter like the fact that he has a knee is bad. if you follow oh j on. twitter chu doon like what are you. doing dude he has i always pull up the wrong. one how about fake accounts. dude this [ __ ] kills me when somebody like i saw a guy torry doing it the other day. and i like i like a tory. but he was like he was like yo like how many followers his guy torry have on instagram he's like a comedian he's got so many followers and then like these this is you you know who usually does this is instagram models because they're not famous but they want to. be and part of being famous. is having like dummy accounts. so if a girl has like two hundred and forty five thousand. followers they'll be like this is a fake account it's not me and that that one has like five account five followers and they're like just so you know if this one is not like of course is not you the real one has [ __ ] 2400 and [ __ ] million followers

about everything. now there's a lot of fake oj accounts. out there so this one at the real oj 32. is the only official one. so it should be a lot. of fun i got a little getting even to. do hey i got a little again. even to do a hello. twitter world it's oj simpson's all efficient solar official. account is a lot. of fake ones out there. why does he turn. into a [ __ ] old i mean. he said well this is yours. truly now coming soon. the twitter you'll get to. read all my thoughts and opinions on just about everything. just about everything like how black eyes. are [ __ ] so younglooking until one

here's the thing. about oj's there's a [ __ ] thing about how his he was thought he was caught he was covering up for his son. that's the only conspiracy theory. that's like oh that [ __ ] because you believe a father would do that. for our son and he'll never admit. it right but oj was supremely jealous. and definitely probably killed those people so it's all good. so it's all good hello. toward

fifty. whatever and tom cruise. would have would have would have sincerely lost. and they would have interviewed him. after the fight and they are depending on people who and he would have been like

matter slammed them. this is a hollywood celebrity. shutting down reporters you robert. downey jr. are the reason. i'm asking about the past. is that you you've talks in other interviews. again about your relationship with your father. and you can see he's already steaming the dark. periods you enters and taking drugs and drinking. and all of that and i just wondered whether you know. you think you're free of all. of that or whether that's still some sorry. i really don't know what are we. doing well i'm just asking questions. that's all right by man. just saying bye you know. he should only afford one that's what you should do. when somebody asked questions you don't want. you looking for we go. like this and don't even say. anything and just wave your hand. in their face imagine if you just saw somebody. like sam jackson just oh yeah. i would like to. talk about and he just doesn't ain't just goes. until and is it what are you doing. and you saw and then just get up. and leave you

see my dick. and balls and [ __ ] and and i'll get arrested. and i'll be like we shouldn't wouldn't. have to wear pants to. society who cares it'll be like whoa. chris lee is [ __ ] crazy i'll be like you saw this [ __ ] come on [ __ ] look at the catalogues of congratulations but that's the thing when you like when you look at somebody like keanu reeves it which is like just unbelievable how amazing he stayed positive how do you stay positive how do you stay like we don't know much about calories but we know every time you hear about kennedy's it's of him doing the nicest thing like people will be like yeah my dog's county reeves [ __ ] literally jumped in front of a moving train to. save my dog or kenny's yeah. dude i was talking to. counter reeves and i mentioned he you know i mentioned i need like some [ __ ] blood transfusion and he straightup drove me to. the hospital and he gave me some blood. i guess it comes from him. not you know what comes. from and for sure him not having a twitter instagram. account he's had an instagram or twitter it'd. be over you get if you have a twitter and instagram. you can get canceled. you know but if you don't you kind of can. i mean you can but not really. though because sean connery doesn't have this [ __ ] and you're all the [ __ ] he said i people were tweeting about that [ __ ] they didn't have a twitter account have a twitter or an instagram people think they can't like write to. you so they're like oh he's not gonna see it. i think they do it. when they're like this mother. because my mode sean connery said about like you you should slap. women ha and then he doubled down on it he was having an interview and i was like so you said you should slap. women he's like yes i think i think that you should i was. like well i don't like that. very much as i will sometimes. i reckon up worst worst on a [ __ ] impression ever but like he and and then and then like people were like we got to. cancel him and then it came out. on twitter a little bit but then he doesn't have a twitter so people. are like a [ __ ] it boy he's not gonna he's old he's old i got to. get rid of my [ __ ] that's the thing i kind of get to. the point where you look. at output that's the thing i always talk. about this it's like al. pacino in someone you become undirected in your own. life that's what it is. if you're not with a [ __ ] hardcore if you don't have somebody. that grounds you in a real. way you go you're done. you go crazy like you need a wife or a [ __ ] real person. that can just bring that's what that's why. that's where actors get so bad. that's why you're like what. the [ __ ] happened to. that actor used to. be so good now look what the [ __ ] he's doing because he was in he got too much. of an ego and then he started. being in movies and the directors could hold him. down that's why every now and then al pacino. has a movie where he's just you're like what. the [ __ ] is he doing he still kills. it i mean he's still brilliant. and [ __ ] as an actor connectors even really brilliant. you know but al pacino every now. and then you're like oh he's al. pacino because you can't direct that [ __ ] unless you're a [ __ ] really good director directors don't want to. let don't want to. tell him they don't do. that can you do it. this way because they know opportunies gonna be like wow. and then you have to. have an answer and you're talking to. the legend al pacino de niro. these guys walken is a great. example really really good but if you [ __ ] not directing him it would just be like wow wow uh and then you'd be like okay just make it any sense dude you gotta have someone you gotta have someone to. direct your life dude. you gotta have a wife or syrup. partner otherwise [music] if drake had a wife at that ride home would be like what was it she'd be like what what what. is it what is it. was the chips with the dip thing 100%. and she'd be like what do. you mean she would be like why. do you what is the chips. with the dip and he's explaining you know like chips the dip the championship and then the dip so i went on like it was like if chips would that's when you realize oh [ __ ] i'm an idiot because you have to. look at someone's face when you're explaining it. for real wives are partners. whatever the [ __ ] maybe you you know [ __ ] dudes or whatever that's good but you need to. do to [ __ ] keep it real i'll keep it 100. that's why keeping it a hundred you. got you're not let but also you know. you could still have a wife. and [ __ ] go nuts like kanye. i guess but that's probably because kim cade you. know is probably yeah that's the thing. if you have another out to. lunch [ __ ] person on your team that's the thing i guess it's about staying grounded i don't like figuring the [ __ ] out before the show by the way i don't like figuring it out i like talking it out because we need to. figure it out as a cult. because this is a cult. dude but staying positive in the limelight. is amazing staying positive and not losing your [ __ ] mind. like keanu reeves is done now. granted he's only like 52 but there's this. whole thing about doubling down. though now that like seems to. work because there's so many people out there. on the internet like trump. and everybody just doubles the [ __ ] now look at just see someone let any other time in history [ __ ] even ten years ago. he would have been like yeah. [ __ ] up but he knows there's enough people out there because he sees them on the internet that he's like no i really got [ __ ] jumped even though you orchestrated the whole goddamn thing and it was a saddam we know we know that he [ __ ] made it up there's still conspiracy. theorists out there there's enough of them there's hundreds of thousands of [ __ ] that do this that think this and he's just sitting there nah he knows he's lying but he's like nah didn't happen i got mugged and jumped and because of that people like even real people like anthony anderson and [ __ ] will be like yeah dude i believe him huh i got quest my thing is what about the so much evidence it has to. be now though because it doesn't last like everyone. knows oh gee i didn't. do it i mean everyone knows. oj did it sorry so so it has to. be now if some [ __ ] goes down now there's enough people to. be on your [ __ ] team. because there's too many people in the world. it's just there's too many. people that's why i think santos was right. you need to. cut the [ __ ] people in half you saw endgame bro. the first one i was like i'm on thanos. this side look at all. these [ __ ] look at how many [ __ ] first of all look at me annoying. superheroes there are the half of those. got to go and then some people don't have superpowers. and they're just wheat. their mouths to feed. they got a go dude. if the population was cut in half. people like jesse simha let nobody would believe him. nobody would believe him but there's too many. people out there finals for president. dude i'm chillin my babies i had a show saturday and i i had so much fun on stage at the codis fool. i did an episode of match. game i did two episodes. a match game i did that laughing. last year but they had me. back i don't know why. because i [ __ ] said something like [ __ ] guzzler the first time but anyway they had me back. and i wrote down [ __ ] on my card. and they have cameras above. you like vegas and they're like chris. you gotta rewrite that over. the whole loud thing and everyone was like [ __ ] knowing so i guess you can say [ __ ] on network tv so i i did match game. it was really fun i met horatio. sanz who was like my new best. friend loved that guy kirstie alley. and a bunch of other people that i already knew. but yeah mike o'shea was on it. very cool and alec. baldwin is just killer at that. [ __ ] he's so good at he like there's the thing that a comedian. has that like were they're just they're just always on. ready to [ __ ] do a joke. and he he doesn't like if you don't have that. you're not a compete if you don't if you're not a comedian. you i've never seen somebody that. like has that really unless you're like a strong. like if you do comedy. sports or some [ __ ] whatever. they call that improv. [ __ ] but uh alec baldwin kind of has that like he was he he's just so confident. and good and quick with that. [ __ ] he was really funny anyway got a [ __ ] yeah watch match game when i'm on in next year or something whatever comes out dude i've done so many guy i realize how many game shows i don't know i think i'm on that other one too to. tell the truth coming out and then another one. i don't even know like when i did. them game shows are like when you're when you do this. [ __ ] and they ask you to. do a game show you completely forget. about because it's not you the [ __ ] you want to. do you just do it. because you like ought to. be fun but it's not like your goal. in your career so when they when they when they do. when you do a game. show and then a year or two later. when it comes out. you're like oh [ __ ] yeah i've done i've done a bunch of them i don't even know which ones i've done like i think i did to. tell the truth that's what they're to. the anderson right i think that's a new one. that's i think this one. with anthony anderson yeah now i think so yeah. anthony anderson yeah i did that. one i only know by hosts and then i did. one with the other lady. who i loved what the [ __ ] was the game. show called god what the [ __ ] was that show. called no clue no [ __ ] clue they're all reoccurring. they always trying to. bring game shows back to. they'll let a game show. be a hit for 10. years and then it'll go away. and then ten years later. they'll be like this is the reincarnation of [ __ ] [ __ ] bubbles or whatever the hell it's called and because they know was a hit i mean how many times did they brought by match. game probably so many different. times and that's it holly but when he shoots. all of them in like one week. he should solve him in five days he probably four or five million dollars. dude that's so dope. doing a game show being the host of a game she'll. be my nightmare though they'll be my nightmare anytime. you have to. say things that other people wrote not as a character. that's like death to. me like ryan seacrest. job dude i mean he's krock. jogging by the [ __ ] radio. on the radio what he's just. talking that's that's one thing but having to. do american idol being the host of american. idol is i'd rather be a [ __ ] crack [ __ ] cuz at least like you're on the streets and you're like i was kind of cool. i could do it i want. yeah i have to. suck dick every now and then to. get a [ __ ] kick but also at least i get the key. you know but having to. show up to work on. ass in a suit and just be like this. next contestant like dude. get the [ __ ] out i swear to. god our other suck dick. for cocaine then be like this next. contestant hails any time you have to. say the word hales put a [ __ ] dick in my ass instead for crack dude host worst job. ever i'm a host here but i don't i get to. say whatever the [ __ ] i want i'm even really a house. i'm just [ __ ] bullshitting. but anytime you got to. be like this next contestant hails from virginia. let's listen to. her do her sing song. rendition of lose yourself. right you're gonna lose yourself. in the moment yo knit. row knit mitten do you ever see that. french guy come out that blind. french dude come out and sing lose. yourself that [ __ ] is so rockin he's like blind. and first of all i didn't realize this. but being blind. makes you look more french. i never realized this but it's the truth. if you google this guy blind. lose yourself first of all he looks so french. it's unreal dude shape. face nice glasses play. it yeah here we go. so blind lose yourself. first of all the fact that you can youtube. blind to lose yourself. is just means you know. he comes out they gotta walk. him out because he's blind. his [ __ ] okay that's his family the families. are always just [ __ ] so happy that they're even there. and that's so beautiful now. if he's blind why. does he have glasses. on is what i want to. know okay so either he's tricking. us or what the [ __ ] going on but you know he's really blind. cuz he's got that one. eye that's like going out the other way. right looks like wonky titties. you ever take a good. that's how dumb guys are. you tell you you have a girl. take her shirt off and then she's got titties. and one nipples looking like it's trying. to get away and you go. like this alright well [ __ ] it you know i guess you can be my girlfriend and wife haha looks don't really matter that much though right right. that's what that looks looks on. the important thing all right. it's what's on the inside. that that matters right. so right when you meet someone like i mean i'm not superficial. right so you know if you meet it. someone in the opposite sex it's especially for a guy. doesn't matter right looks aren't it's not. what's important is what's important. on the inside right. so it doesn't matter if your face. isn't symmetrical or if you have your fat so fat fat fat guy. or girl it's all good. okay so so this guy sings. lose yourself and he comes out. his parents are and it's everyone's so excited you know. and he just dude. if you're blind i didn't know. that if you're blind. or if you have an eye. that goes off to. the side you look. more french
