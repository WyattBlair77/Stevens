recently david arnold um yeah he was a good one. man i was just [ __ ] talking to. him um i just did. a show with him at the laugh. factory it's [ __ ] it's brutal. um yeah but uh so um what was i g. to say i was going. to talk about dc i. was going to get i want. went to dc and um did. i put it in my notes. i barely [ __ ] wrote any notes i'm good at this. dude i go to. dc and like dc is. a very interesting city. washington dc because washington dc is. a very very interesting. city um but the thing about washington dc. is that always blows my mind. first of all the white house. looks like it's every other building. looks like the white house. which is [ __ ] crazy like [ __ ] so many columns like there's so many columns everywhere like it's just some [ __ ] grand like where are we rome you know it's [ __ ] and we went to. visit to the uh capitol building. and we saw you know. everything up there with the capital. building um and they were all like scaffolding and [ __ ] and you go up to. them and you're like hey is uh what are you. redoing the place and they're like well. we're just making sure that this the structure. the integrity of the structure is a sound after the and you're like dude. this is just so people [ __ ] can't get in right. because we're supposed to. be able to. [ __ ] walk right up to. it hey just walk right. up and um and yeah it's crazy. you look at the [ __ ] walls on the capitol building. they have like steps on them. like like grooves in them. like it m it's it's like they're inviting you to. just like climb up. those [ __ ] uh what do you call it the policemen were just standing there and when the [ __ ] january 6 insurgents were crawling up they would just be like and whoa you're just like got it and the police would just be like with their [ __ ] hands oh and then but what's crazy about [ __ ] washington dc is here's the thing you need an update washington dc okay you need an update all right do you know why because in like the year. 1850 there weren't that many people. when was the car made like 19. something or before that. like 19 19,000 1900 and like8 you know. i know i read a book. about henry ford when i was in [ __ ] school. dude and um there's a picture book. and so and he like in in 1850. it was fine to. have like everything's so close. to each other like the washington monument. like the [ __ ] uh the lincoln memorial. man i always think when i see the when i think of the washington monument. i always think of uh what's his name. talib quelly saying and my cash look more like dickson washington monument so bad um and i cash look more like dicks than a washington monument so bad and so um and real hiphop heads will be like but that's real hip hop you know what i mean that's real hiphop a cash look like dicks more than the washington mon monument if you want to. know if hiphop lyrics are actually really good. say them in a radio announcer. voice you know what i mean. like when you hear y. short it's your birthday shorty and you know we don't give a [ __ ] it's since your birthday. like you're like [ __ ] yeah dude in vegas that's nice but when you when you say it like go shy. it's your birthday and you know. we don't give a [ __ ] because it's not your birthday. then you realize okay it's actually bad. our cash stack more like dicks than the washington monument. um tonight at 11. and so anyway um it was fine. in 1850 okay but hey it's 2022. not only are there [ __ ] bicycles not only are there cars. but there's ubers someone will just drive you. four blocks away to. where the president lives should be illegal. dude you can just walk up. to where the leader. of the free world resides hey that's got to. change because of dirty bombs. and crazy people i want my president. living way out there. just like in a side. of a [ __ ] mount i want him safe i don't give a [ __ ] who it is trump. the lizard biden it doesn't matter. i don't care who it. is you know whether it's trump. or [ __ ] joe biden and if he's just fresh from the ocean. and he [ __ ] shed his scales and he came back. into this white house. i want the white house. in the side of a [ __ ] mountain in the middle of some place. where there's other mountains. that look just like it. and we can't tell which mountain. it's in dude it's so insane. that in this day an age. that you can just hey just walk right. up you could be staying a w. hotel and just walk three blocks. and yell for the president. through his wind press. biden i'm in room. 3:15 at the at the w hotel. if you want to. come in i'm getting [ __ ] sliders. biden trying to sleep. god damn it because this is a lizard. um but yeah dude. that's got to change this is. why i say tradition. ruins everything cuz the president. lives there still because he lived there. for since 17 or whatever the [ __ ] it was you know i'm bad with dates but you need to. update that [ __ ] with the time tradition ruins. everything wars and every but even more than relig. tradition religion is tradition any tradition. is [ __ ] up right. my dad used to. want to read the [ __ ] what was the train. christmas book what's that called polar express every christmas. day he wanted to. read it and that was cool when i was 6 and 11. but dude he we had to. stop him like 5 years. i'm 42 five years ago. i'm like dad i just you know. it's like i don't i it's fine. i get it he's just like but the magic. of christmas and i'm like i'm 37. that's fine can you can. we just not read it. he's like but it's tradition. then you get me all pent. up and then before you know. it i don't want to. come over for christmas. that's a very micro to. the world's macro but i'm saying that kind of [ __ ] is the micro and the macro is walking up to. the [ __ ] white house and rocket launcher in the new [ __ ] device. the vp um yeah i mean. it's crazy you could just pop. in an u and be like the white. house house like i get it. america but also chill right. and now a word from our. sponsor better help listen okay just listen. i struggle with a lot. mentally

annoying. oh there's still queens and kings dude. huh hey that's that. first of all that's insane you know what they're going. to be queens and kings until you build cars. if you have cars. which pretty much we all. do no kings and queens anymore. like if you're [ __ ] working you know in in south africa trying to. mine blood diamonds and you got to. get everywhere with like one jeep and a few [ __ ] lions or whatever. or you know like what you've got like two jeeps and then other men. carry everyone else then there can be a king right. right cuz you need to. [ __ ] make people want to. carry you but if you've got like multiple cars. and [ __ ] and trains and airplanes. dude no queens no kings it's insane. it's so weird and she died. and now the [ __ ] guy with the [ __ ] sausage fingers got to. be the king you see his hands. he looks like uh what's that. [ __ ] scene from big little big china or whatever the [ __ ] big trouble. in little china when the guy. blows up he looks like he's [ __ ] 5% into. that scene what's his name. charles prince now he's king charles and he's like 70. what you know god that guy. i just he should [ __ ] die. soon you know with his little sausage. [ __ ] with his with his farmer. john fingers no just you know. of course all all glory. to the queen but it's just like you know you know what happens. when she dies right. my sausage fingers get more. rings on it you know. what happens right i got to. be the king now it's fine. like it's all good like i want. her to be the queen but it's like you know what happens. when she dies right. i become the most important man. in britain and then she died. and he just goes like this. all right here we [ __ ] go she died. and he was just like his [ __ ] sausage. fingers putting on the rayb bands. putting on the aviators what happened. what happened she died what. happened the queen [music] died. hit the wrong button [ __ ] yeah dude um so now he's the [ __ ] king and he's the king and he's going to. die in like five years. dude the lengthy she was the queen for like 900 years and he's going to. be the king for six months. talk about the [ __ ] raw end dude he could have just been ding that [ __ ] up and now he's just like you know it doesn't work right he's just now he's just got to. [ __ ] be like ruling y also you're not doing [ __ ] at that point when you're ruling a country and you're [ __ ] 75 i feel like the president. actually does real work and the king's just like you know. bring me some more lemonade and don't allow. blacks in here like she was. so racist but she had [ __ ] 45 dogs and she treated the dogs. better than the minorities or something the queen i don't know i don't mean to. [ __ ] i have no idea. this podcast you come here. for hardhitting news but honestly. i'm going to tell you when i don't. know and i don't know i'm the [ __ ] king of england. how about that how about [ __ ] that how about them. apples i got a number how about them. apples i watch that movie. i walked in the other day. and kristen was like watching [ __ ] you know it's like i love her she saved. my [ __ ] life dude she's a princess and i love her she saved my my life she's one of the reasons i'm still here today dude. and i walked in and she was watching [ __ ] goodwill hunting. and i just go godamn it. i want to. watch something bad i don't like good movies. dude and she was like i never saw it. before and she said it. and her voice was all christmy and it was beautiful. and i was just like okay. well oh yeah and she was like is it. a good it's a good movie. and i was like it is a good. movie you know but those movies i only want to. watch once really fantastic. deep emotional movies i want to. watch them once and then i'm out now. that's because me for 38. years of my life i didn't want to. feel my feelings yes that's because 38. for 38 years of my life. i kept my walls up. and i didn't want to. experience loneliness yes of course dude. and i kept my face. in my phone because i thought that that meant. i was cool being alone. but really i was just distracting. my loneliness yes we did. that dude and i've learned. that in therapy and it's all. good but now i have to. watch movies and i have to. cry and that [ __ ] is too much. so i'm watching goodwill hunting. i've seen it once and i know. i cried during the movie. just like i [ __ ] cried during the movie braveheart and i've seen it once okay and i've never seen braveart again. because it's too emotional. and there's too much. brown in it okay. and um to. be frank there's too much. brown and goodwi hunting. too it's just too. much it's just like put colors in it. more you know have blue. in the [ __ ] thing and um and i'm watching goodwill and she's like sit down watch it with me. i'm like i didn't really want to. but then i was like this. movie is so good if i just sit down and watch it. for like 5 minutes i bet. i'll hook into it. but i i'll then resent that i did. that because i didn't want to. do that and now that i and i'm basically just trick. this is the kind of mind. [ __ ] [ __ ] i go through i don't want to. watch goodwill hunting she wants. me to watch goodwill hunting. i know it's a good movie. i'd probably like it if i sat. down and started watching it. but i don't want to. but i should do that. for her so i'm going. to sit down and try to.

what's the point in having king being a king i don't get fuing suck. jobs it's not so anyway rip. to the queen i got a [ __ ] cut here in my head like do you ever wake up. with a cut this is the this. hurts so bad you can see. it's on my forehead if you're listening. to it it it looks like a mini [ __ ] stabon that somebody did it with a pocket. uh swiss army knife. i woke up and just all of a sudden how does this. happen dude it's like the same. kind of mystery as like where did my other sock. go you know what i'm talking. about it's like it's got to. be somewhere in this room. i just washed it and now the washing machine. ate it do you ever. wake up with a cut or a bruise. and you're like okay well alien switched my. body out to. another version of my body. because i didn't hit my [ __ ] head last night. and then today kristen's like you're bruised. what what happened and i was like it. happened [ __ ] i woke up in with with in dc and she was like i i said did you notice it. and she said yeah i was like why. the [ __ ] didn't you say anything about it she's like i don't know i was like did you [ __ ] stab did you just [ __ ] while i was sleeping with your [ __ ] finger take a chunk out and it's hurts so much more than it should dude and i'm a real man cow fell and hit his [ __ ] eye today but he's he's okay god when he falls down i just i just always tell him the worst part's. over you already hurt. you're done love you. buddy you're all good oh dude. and he was eating at at this. place today he was eating more than i have ever seen him. eat like and and i know this sounds boring. as [ __ ] but just wait for it okay it gets better. but you know like that's the last thing. i want to. hear is like how your son. or daughter eats you know. so his appetite actually lately. it's like [ __ ] snooze city. i don't even want to. hear what you ate i don't. even care what i ate honestly. i forget try to. think about what you ate. for lunch you can remember no. right i can't remember tuna bow took me a bit. and so um calvin was eating. we went to. this place i got the tuna bowl he got the [ __ ] eggs he wanted i said what do you want calvin. he said eggs so i like oh great. he [ __ ] he rarely says. what he wants he either. wants eggs or [ __ ] you know macaros that's macaroni because what my mom used to. call it and that's why i called it. to him and he took it and ran. with it it's all good. and uh or he wants bacon. okay you can't always have bacon. obviously macaro is very easy. because us we have macaroni in the kitchen. because we're italian and eggs is very easy. to make if we don't have it. even if we don't have it. but we were at the place. he wanted eggs so we got eggs. i was eating my tuna bowl. and he was eating his eggs. and i have never seen him. eat better than than this. he was shoveling those [ __ ] eggs in his mouth and i was like [ __ ] yeah dude this is the moment where he turns into. a [ __ ] boy because if you know anything about my son which you probably know a lot about my son if you listen to. this podcast regularly cuz i talk about him. quite often but he's good. at everything except doesn't want to. eat always wants to. play i'm like are you hungry. and he goes i no i'm not you know. and stomps do you want i i got a p. do you want cheerios. no i don't okay. eggs i don't okay. i got to guess. what do you want and finally this. time he's like eggs i'm like eggs. and he's shoving the [ __ ] in his mouth i like did we get a [ __ ] did we crack the code did we figure out a [ __ ] life hack right and so he's eating the [ __ ] i mean bro he's eating so fast and he's using the fork he never used the fork he always supped to. use his hand he's using a fork. putting it in his mouth. dude he's doing it. like me like i always like to. have a piece of food. in my mouth and when i swallowed there's another piece of food. in my mouth because i always want the flavor. explosion in my mouth when the shit's traveling. down my esophagus and there's nothing in my mouth. that's wasted time i want. it always in my mouth. there's food always in my mouth. it's replacing the food sliding. down my esophagus it's always replacing. the food sliding. down so i always have a [ __ ] explosion of flavor. in my mouth that's always how i do it. dude and i'm like calvin is doing like like father. like son and he's eating eggs and he eats the whole bowl. dude and he takes a sip of spicy. water which is what we call. club he's unspicy water and so he eats the [ __ ] club soda he starts drinking. the club soda and we think the bubbles. are getting to. him in his head. cuz he's going like this. or like this and i'm like you like the spicy. water and she's like uh something's going. on and he just goes dude. when i tell you it. was like a sprinkler went off. it was like an egg sprinkler. went the it was like a a geyser. went off sideways slowly it wasn't and it kept come all the eggs and then eggs from a past life just shot just spilled out and kristen goes whoop like she was azie smith just scooping a bouncer just caught all of the eggs. all of his spit up. and then he goes because of scary. [ __ ] when you're two and a half. you don't he has never thrown up. that much he probably thought why did my insides. come out so i picked him up. and i held him and i said to. him and he was crying. and he said hey buddy that's okay. you know what that happens. to me sometimes too and he stopped crying. and he said it does. and i said yeah it happens. to everybody and and he [ __ ] took a deep breath and that was it dude. and it was a beautiful. [ __ ] moment because we're all human and let's not forget. that dude and i love being a dad. and i love being a dad. especially when my son throws. up with eggs because um i want him. to feel comfortable and i want. to make him feel comfortable. and i want to. be the good dad about that. mhm and then asked the guy. for some milk so c. could have some milk and he brought over. milk and he was like no. he didn't bring it over. he he brought over a cup. of ice and he was like you you want. he was like you want um ice with the milk. and i was like you're not from earth. ice with milk honestly if you drink. milk with ice in it. i want you to. un subscribe for my podcast. i want you to. shake hands with me it's been fun. thank you i enjoy if you've listen. to every episode great i loved having you listen. but it's time we part. ways and i looked at. him and i was like and i said no no. thank you just the milk. is fine and kristen laughed and i said what. and she was like just you and i was like no. no no no we're not we're not doing. that with this okay no no no. [laughter] what is it and she was. like you just you know. you don't want ice with milk. and i was like have you ever. drank ice with milk and she was like no and i said well then what's the problem and she was like well it's just you know you just you just you have your rules. and i was like that's not my rule. that's like putting ice in peanut. butter so i [ __ ] uh i don't know man. one time i was eating. cereal with my friend mitch and he was and i was like and he had cereal. too and we were both. eating cereal it was late at night and i was like you want something to. drink and he was like what i was like do. you want something to. drink i'm going to the fridge. and he was like i'm eating. cereal and i was like what are you talking about and he he was like why would i want something to. drink while i'm eating cereal. and i was like am i what's happening. and he was like that's like asking do you want. water when you're drinking. water and i don't agree. with but i forget think about it. all the time dude. cuz he thinks milk. is in it dude. and you're just drinking and eating. at the same time [ __ ] man. i don't know man i i i drink.

[ __ ] and i'm like you know i don't give a [ __ ] who's the president. man we're [ __ ] no matter what that's the whole thing. about this but he's a nihilist. you know but it's all good. bu's a nihilist because i don't. give a [ __ ] who the as long. as the president isn't woke as [ __ ] we're all good like biden is just a [ __ ] puppet with all the [ __ ] behind him i don't know i don't like any president. i i have not liked any president. since nixon my favorite kidding i. have no idea i'm political you. know what i mean but football's back. so we're we're going to. be that and i like how um i guess. what's his name the [ __ ] tom the most famous one tom brady is uh doing um he's goingon to. play another he keeps coming. out of retirement like he's [ __ ] jayz like he's and and he's doing uh another season and now jelle bunin or whatever the [ __ ] her last name is is is she's like well [ __ ] she moved out she moved out because she was like you got to. you i want you to. spend time with the kids and it's like it's crazy. to think of tom brady. cuz i you know i understand. that kind of mentality because you know. like when i do standup. i don't know i guess. for a while i didn't want to. really do it anymore. two years ago but now i i i i fell in love. with it again and i love being on stage. and then i'm thinking about like if i were never able. to to able to. do it ever again. would i would like what is there. to prove but it's different. though because he's already won. so much and is obviously the best. to keep wanting to. play to me. i don't know maybe that's why. i don't have that mindset. you know maybe i've never been i've never been competitive. but like i i can't believe he wants. to play again. and i get what jazelle is saying. because it's like at some point. you made a billion dollars. you're chilling and you can continue. to make a billion dollars. it's not like the well of money. that you [ __ ] dip from is going away. because of investments and and endorsements and deals. and [ __ ] like that and restaurants. you're probably going to. make you know and a [ __ ] you probably you know have stock in whatever company is making you know. in some iowaska company that's going. to be huge in [ __ ] nine years. you know and uh or or robotics or whatever. the [ __ ] those those dog robots. they have he probably invested in that. he's going to be a quadrillionaire but whatever. it is it's like but he just wants. to play dude and at some point. i kind of understand what jelle's. saying because it's like dude. i take my son. on the road with me. and when he doesn't come with me. which is yet which hasn't. happened yet i don't think. um and if and i don't get to. take my family with me. i'm going to be like really. upset and lonely and what i told you in the beginning. of the podcast is i hate being lonely. because that's when you got to. sit and actually think about what the [ __ ] is going on especially when you're open doors especially when the [ __ ] doors be really open and the windows be really open too and your chimney really be unclogged. and so it's like how many years. does he need to. throw a ball because that's the thing. if i'm tom brady. which i am and if my wife is jelle bunin which she is. and my kid are all of tom brady's. kids which he is and my wife is like i don't want you. to do another tour. i want you to. be with my i want you to. be with the kid i would have some sort of resentment. about it but ultimately i want. to be with the kid. but i don't know what the [ __ ] their daytoday is i mean they probably they probably follow. him she probably wants them. to be stable well. i'm supposing a lot. of [ __ ] i don't know see this is what i'm doing. this is what bloggers do and then they write. a [ __ ] piece and then it's like [ __ ] tom brady for doing this [ __ ] but i don't know the answer so i guess i'm just talking it out thanks for the therapy session my babies um i don't know let's see what's up go get tickets at chia dot com i'll be in stockton and oakland and [ __ ] raleigh and savannah georgia um denver. boston we added a second show. the [ __ ] wang filled up. 3,500 seats we added another. one dude uh let's sell that. one out too my babies. and uh i'm starting to. tease you a little bit with these [ __ ] chicago you know i am playing peoria and rockford but i'm teasing you with chicago and i'm teasing you with new york your boy might be there in the next beginning of the next year. he just might he just might be there. in san diego i'm also going. to be oh in phoenix i added. a date or sorry. tempe and then oxnard i just added. a date oxnard california but whatever dude. let's look at some of these [ __ ] let's look. at the tinder first we always do. the oh yeah i know. know i know seinfeld did the ki thing. and i did kind of want. to talk about that cuz you know i like kith. i always rep kith. and then seinfeld's just like 60. wearing kith and stuff but didn't they do. it with um god i always forget. his name who bui and then they also did. it with uh didn't they do it. with the [ __ ] uh jeff goblin or no. did was that gucci or something. whatever but anyway i like when they do it. with the old guys man. but now it's like what am i going. to wear [ __ ] exactly the same. thing that seinfeld has wearing like [ __ ] i mean so new york. you know the way he's posing and [ __ ] with his hat so felt just like this. i saw a clip where [ __ ] seinfeld was like but that's why a joke. is ma what did. it say that's why a joke. is magic i
