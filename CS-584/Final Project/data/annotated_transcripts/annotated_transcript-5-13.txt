[ __ ] so let's see well what the [ __ ] been going on dude i was it i was it uh oh i did my shows in oakland and las vegas and then i flew all the way. over to connecticut mmhmm when i was in oakland. dude when i was in oakland. first of all seok 'land dude. when i was in oakland. for some reason i always thought that oakland. had so much graffiti in it. i don't know why i thought that. i don't know if i saw a movie or some [ __ ] or whatever but when i got to. oakland everything was graffiti and i was like i was right. how did i know. that i've never been to. oakland got to. oakland saw everything that was spraypainted in bubbly letters oakland is so gangster dude. like the stuff like the side. of starbucks has [ __ ] colorful popping off. letters and [ __ ] everything is graffitied you park your car you walk into. a place you come back. your car got graffiti on. the side of it. and she says [ __ ] oakland zone with the z. oakland zone oakland's own yeah dude. so so i went to. oakland there was so much. graffiti did the show i was with my i was with two. openers hmm the show is pretty good. the theaters [ __ ] goddamn beautiful dude i don't even know why that theater is shown it's so crazy. when a theater sona that theater. so nice it revamped oakland. there were like two blocks. of oakland that were like really nice and then the rest of it. you can get [ __ ] so killed two blocks. oakland beautiful the rest of the blocks. oakland you can get so killed but so no but oakland. is like apparently the the place. that they're like gentrifying next outside. it's like the silver lake. of san francisco but so i did the show. got back it's really not much. to do in oakland. at least on a [ __ ] thursday night. and so i so we went back. that we tried to. get a delivery for food. from a nap and we got it. and waited for an hour. which is sometimes how long it. takes understood maybe thursday night. in oakland is a busy time. for the food app service uh called me fifty minutes. in and said hey sorry. but the pizza place to. try to get pizza from. ran out of dough fifty. minutes at fifty minutes. in dude now my level of rage. through the roof call. me in the beginning you got them. pizza place this way we [ __ ] diminished. that the fiery rage okay. breathe through it was starving still thought. you know what fifty minutes. of my life

doom doom da dum da da dum dum dum da da da dee da dadadada but the can really go around wow wow anyway they were [ __ ] so i went onstage i talked about boys. to men for [ __ ] ten minutes before i did my act which was basically i just did what i just did for you guys so you welk so anyway then i went to connecticut and i had a show for a college yukon which is a legit college big college and it was cool i actually it was a great show for me i had a good time and all that [ __ ] and you know the car the kids seemed to really like it i said kids but you know we're all really we're all young we're all young did we're all young i'm in that generation okay i'm young as [ __ ] hmm and then i got a google alert which i still have on my name which i got to get off the ship it's so annoying i did the show was fine made fun of the [ __ ] [ __ ] there and then going into my material and did this did the show didn't regular [ __ ] follow the leader tour and then this the campus one of the people on the campus wrote about it and let me find some stuff here just some of the stuff that's said on this book article article while many of his jokes were offensive or targeted individuals there seemed to be a defined line he wouldn't cross for laughs i guess i don't know i mean i wouldn't consider that by myself but even though when even when he did go a little too far his jokes were still wellreceived whatever yada yada um hold on a second daliyah's best joke this is the [ __ ] there's just like what are you doing here why you ranking jokes um let me go to the part that i saw though some kid they interviewed a kid i thought it was really funny i don't usually go for comedy but i thought this was really cool okay cool thanks but um oh here we go one of of his jokes the worst received one was about how i'm not gonna say it cuz you should come see it anyway the worst received one the shock noise the shocked noise that colored most that i can own that part echo the shock noise echoed across the audience which while not entirely uncommon in the leas show lacked all the laughter it had in the prior instances you know what's funny is that's not a joke that part that's the set up the thing that the referencing. is the setup to. the joke that by the way. after that after that part. of my act i talked about how sometimes people get offended. and this prompted him it says this. prompted him to jump. into his speech about how most comedians don't do. college get night that didn't say. that i said a lot. of comedians won't do to. colleges because college students get offended. really easily i said he doesn't give a [ __ ] about that. and that he would have wouldn't apologize. yeah right and so that's what i did. so what they didn't. [ __ ] add this is so funny because this is where we're at was that got a huge applause break. so the they're saying the worst. of the worst received joke. which was not a joke. it was the setup to. the joke which never gets a laugh. because it's not a joke. so this person like doesn't get what a setup. or a punchline is fine. that end of that joke. got a huge laugh so here's the thing. that's [ __ ] crazy too the jokes. not offensive it's just not. an offensive joke it's a literally. a madeup thing that has never happened. and that i just make up. and so it's not offensive. because didn't happen anyone so so this. is why comedians don't want. to play colleges. but it's funny because everyone in the crowd. laughed and this person wrote this. and this was the person that didn't like that. joke so they are writing this. so now it seems like people. didn't like that part which is not. true but this is a this. is this is what's [ __ ] up. is that it's i mean. this is kind of a version. of virtuous signaling because like you you're this. person's the people will then read this. and be like oh he can't say that. kind of stuff thanks for speaking. out or whatever and it's like you're the this. kind of time we live in the people. who say you can't say. that because it hurts people's feelings. or you can't say that. because it's offensive. are perceived as the good guys. so this person writes this subconsciously or consciously. because it makes them. feel like a good guy. because then other people will be like ah good to. stand up for that even though. it's so unnecessary because it's a comedy. show the people who write this are the minority. though but it's the people. who write this that write. this which means this is the [ __ ] that's being written. which means this is the [ __ ] that's being read. and this 100% this kind of thing. is why trump got elected so it's all good. but that's what happened. um because i was at the show. do you know why it's my show. i was on the stage. everyone laughed and had a good. time there were no parts. that were touchandgo or weird ah now. this person on this. blog is said in for the show. was funny they didn't say. the show was not good they they said you know. it was a good show. it was fun it was just like it. i just thought it was it. was funny how interesting how he still had to. pick that kind of a thing because it was like the college. thing to do she's so [ __ ] interesting this [ __ ] that's going on in the world these the the the the the the the they're not the majority who feel this way but because they're the people who write about it. it makes it seem that. way and then the people who shame like this. isn't one of those things as it was nothing. but like if somebody saw that and decided to. shame me for it and then it piled. on i mean it's nothing. but and they're piled on. and it became a thing. it would seem like my life. was over but it's not because these people are just they're few. and far in between. but they're the people who write about. it because everyone who liked it. was everyone in the audience. i was there there was one or two people. that thought this and that's the person. who writes the article because they want to. seem like a good guy and that's the [ __ ] problem they're not a good guy they're just doing neck. nothing the whole idea if comedy. isn't offensive to. anyone it's not comedy. it's offensive all jokes. are offensive to. somebody otherwise it's not funny. that's it so thanks for saying the show. is good and funny. but if you think that that. joke is offensive what do. you get into the real. [ __ ] world dude where do you get out of college. and get to a place. where do you where do you leave. college and get to. anywhere you're gonna cry a lot okay nobody tell me nothing softie please.
