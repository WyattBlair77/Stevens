[ __ ] the the the other italian. mafia family then he comes back. in two episodes and let me tell you something. dude he comes back. in two episodes he is a different. person he is so he's he's lost. a bunch of weight. like this guy just did. it in what well how long does. it take to. do an episode nine days so that's 18. days in 18 days. the guy lost like [ __ ] 35 pounds came back with a mohawk and stubble. and the dude looked hot. as [ __ ] and and he was a different person now this italiano what's his name dude. the lead in [ __ ] gamora i don't know but i follow him on instagram and he is so [ __ ] good all of these actors are so good and guess what dude none of them are [ __ ] crying that's the kind of acting i want to. do i want to. be in a real drama with. zero crying everyone's always crying. in the american dramas dude. [ __ ] all that bottle it up and italianos are the most emotional [ __ ] people on the planet. but when they're acting they bottle it up. gentlemen oh your [ __ ] husband died. oh what happened your kid. flunked out of college. oh what happened you lost. your legs that's it dude. bottling it up and guess who bottles. it up even more dude. the [ __ ] women dude just walking in all buxom when their husbands dying. they don't give a [ __ ] man. boxing me [ __ ] butt bottled up it's insane. gamora really behind so he comes back. he's practically a different person. he's acting different but you still believe. it that's how good of an actor he is it's not. like when an actor comes back. and he's doing it too much. right like if an actor goes away. for a season then comes back. in a season and he's a changed man. in america you'd be like well he changed. too much but this dude. did it so subtly. but also losing weight but doing it. subtly but also having a mohawk but doing it subtly. but also going out the [ __ ] six o'clock shadow. but also doing it subtly. and all of a sudden this guy's the [ __ ] guy who's gonna be taking over the whole [ __ ] the family and it's beautiful dude but the thing i like about it too is that the sh the show is gray. as [ __ ] now i'm i'm not gonna it's sepia my babies it's practically. sepia right but i'm telling you. right now okay here's the thing. a lot of times movies. will be sepia and i hate it. a lot of times movies. will be the nashville filter. on instagram and i hate it. right a lot of times movies. will definitely be the [ __ ] valencia filter. on instagram and your boy. will hate it but the italians. made this [ __ ] sepia and gray. a little bit and what did. they do [ __ ] eight episodes. in what did they do. episode eight episodes in everyone does. everyone know italianos you know. what you're doing if you like because it was a very very big show. it was a very big hit. in in italy what did. they do the guy [ __ ] says why is it all gray. outside the guy says why. is it all grey. outside they owned their [ __ ] they really came through dude they really came through that's the thing dude it's like when [ __ ] aquaman is in other movies the guy jason momoa aquaman's in so many movies and not once in any of the movies that jason momoa is in somebody stops and says holy [ __ ] you're [ __ ] huge why wouldn't you do that he's huge he's obnoxious looking he's built like a genie hey dude he's got pubic hair cascading out over his eye over his head dude starting at his eyebrows [ __ ] poofing out straight swooping up along over his head and cascading down his [ __ ] mountain ridge and nobody's mentioning it he's just some guy in a convenience store in a movie nah in italiano if jason mo mo moaini was in a [ __ ] movie dude oh forget it dude he'd walk in and it ties with don jenna banjo what are you doing you're so big what are you doing we got to. take a not only do you have the masters. go side to. side they go up. what is going on and then he dies. and everyone just goes they. don't give a [ __ ] because they bottle it up and you guys sit out. there and [ __ ] listen to. npr dude live my whole. [ __ ] it's just like come on dude. these [ __ ] american shows and everyone wants me to. watch succession and they're [ __ ] showing me. gamora dude and gamora comes up and they're [ __ ] popping [ __ ] family members in their heads dude like it's going out and getting a reese's peanut butter cup the [ __ ] out of town dude i gotta get more italian i swear to. god i'm gonna get [ __ ] shirts that are too small. for my upper body and then a jacket that's even. smaller for my upper body that's the most [ __ ] italian. thing you could possibly. do is wearing a [ __ ] shirt that's too small. but a jacket over. the shirt that's too small. that's even smaller than the shirt. dude and your and even if you don't have a belly. this [ __ ] still pops out. it's like you'd look better. naked but even still you're [ __ ] popping. out looking like a stay puft. like you looking [ __ ] you're looking. like the [ __ ] the the guy who comes at the end. of the ghostbusters movies. and just [ __ ] long genie. shoes with a buckle on it such bad style but [ __ ] will they cap each other oh man and [ __ ] this guy is in it and he's bald and he's rocking the bald look and my brother and i texted uh to. the group chain i said. hey look vin dieselini is in it. and i [ __ ] laughed i left. for about i left just on and off until i went to. sleep that night vin dieselini vin diesel. is not about if your friends. are your family vin dieselini he's good. though dude [ __ ] [ __ ] i want to. do one of those [ __ ] real goddamn you know what dude i don't even need hollywood i want to. go to italy. and just become a [ __ ] good i need to. learn the language god none of you. i love how listening this. podcast none of you have watched. this show and i'm still talking about it. 14 minutes into. this [ __ ] podcast and you're still the people are listening that are still listening even though you have no reference point to. what this show is you're still listening. and those are the [ __ ] homies. dude that's who's in this. cult those are the babies. dude and we're gonna be sitting in high grass. dude let's not forget. that this is a cult. all right we share this. podcast with other friends like the mormons do we go. door to door. knock knock knock knock knock and we say. hello i'd like to. talk to you about that. and then we don't say. the church of jesus christ. of latterday saints but we say here's a link. to congratulations i hope you enjoy it. dude and we hope we hope that. they join us in the tall. grass and they sit outside. of a [ __ ] log cabin and we share ideas so yeah dude it's like go watch gamora. if you have hbo max. i don't give whatever or don't. or don't it's all good. i was scrolling instagram the other day. as you know as we do and i came up. on this this is where we're at this. is how this speaks a lot. to how confused i am. and also where we are in this. ridiculous world but also i don't want you to. forget that i'm i'm taking the blame on. some of this like this isn't just this. isn't just weird uh this isn't just me. complaining about the world it. is not this is how fast. the world is moving. and how 41 years old. i am okay so i am. watching i'm scrolling through. instagram and i find on instagram. um this thing this picture. that hypebeast posts um [music]. and it's and it's this. uh scooter or not. scooter what is it. like a what's the elon musk. quad is it a quad. quad elon musk it's and it's and it's being sold for 1900 no not that not the yes. yeah the quad thing yeah. the quad thing whatever the [ __ ] right okay now i see just a picture of this cyberquad electric atv and it's supposed. to be uh yeah so i see this. picture and it says you can buy it for 1900 bucks. and i look at it. and i'm looking at this. picture and it's got a black background and it looks so futuristic. you know it looks like something. that belongs in demolition. man that you'd watch in the 90s. and you'd be like wow are they really gonna make those one day. and then here it is on my instagram. page and i'm like oh you can. buy it though and then i'm like oh and i'm looking at it. and dude i had to. get out of the app. and google google it because i wasn't sure by. looking at the instagram picture. and by reading the description if it was a [ __ ] nft or not like i we're at the point in the world where i'm looking at something that that they are saying you can purchase and i don't even know if it's a tangible thing anymore. how unbelievable is that guys. who are even older. than me like if i brought this. up to my dad he would be like oh would you see. it on friendster like he wouldn't even. understand he barely understands instagram. and then i'm doing all sorts. of [ __ ] research and looking at this. [ __ ] metaverse and [ __ ] and it's like okay so i buy a nice shirt think about this i buy a nice shirt say it's three thousand dollars i've never spent that much on a shirt but i buy a shirt that's three thousand dollars. and i wanna wear it and i wanna. wear it where i don't wanna. wear it at home i wanna. wear it out why because it's nice and i want people to. see it and i want people to. know that either you know. if i'm of a certain mind. either that i have money or i have fashion. sense or that i know. what's hip any one. of those things maybe some even maybe i just think it. makes me look slender whatever. the [ __ ] it is right. now there's the metaverse. where what's his name. uh travis scott had a uh uh uh a show there. and like 25 000 people came but they went with their like they just went to. this web 3.0 and they just watched the concert. on travis scott is. doing on the internet so they weren't actually there. but they all bought tickets. and they can be like yeah i was at that. concert that's what they're [ __ ] doing nowadays. right this is the first time. that they did it i think but people can we're getting. to the point where you can. buy outfits for your avatars. or your um you can go. into some of these video games. you can literally buy outfits. for some of your characters that you're manipulating. in the video game right. and there are uh monetary. values on each one of those uh outfits you could buy a shirt. for whatever i don't know what. they're going for but 60. or 80 now you'll be why. would you buy anyway it's not. really you but okay. you want to. flex on the people that are in the game. which are essentially the people. that are playing the game. so i go back to. me buying that shirt that's in fashion. or expensive and i wear it on stage. so people will know i take a picture. of that and i put it on instagram. now you have two million people. that follow me that see. that i have that shirt. right and they say me. and that shirt a lot. of those people i'll never meet i'll never have a conversation. with they'll never meet me they'll. never have a conversation. with me but they see i'm at a certain level. right i'm at this. level if you buy one of these quad. these cyber quads how many people are going to. see you riding around. them you're going to. feel a little bit cool. because you're in a cyber quad. maybe you're a tech. geek but maybe you just want it. to have it we're all buying. these things because of the extension of who you are now. which is fine so when i started. to think about it. like that i'm like this. metaverse is [ __ ] on to. something i didn't understand. nfts but why not buy something. that doesn't exist why the [ __ ] not most money. especially if you have it. is electronic anyway you don't [ __ ] see it you don't hold it. so what's wrong with [ __ ] bitcoin what's wrong. with these people saying oh yeah but the the the [ __ ] coins. are gonna crash maybe maybe not people bought a [ __ ] pet rock. in the what was it. the 80s they sold the pet rock. and the only reason why they were able. to sell it is because people were buying. it and there will always be those people and we call them. goodis here but we all have. a little bit of kuda. in us man those barracudas snap to. those shiny objects they can't wear them. a barracuda can't wear a [ __ ] bracelet but they'll snap at one. that's who we all are. man we are all barracudas in the metaverse. and that is some really deep [ __ ] and i'm not the first person. to think of it. this is why this whole thing. [ __ ] exists the metaverse. everyone can be everywhere any given time. in this web 3.0 and that is [ __ ] on absolutely unbelievable. now let's give it a really. subtle really calm breathtaking [music] and i took a sip too but that's [ __ ] crazy huh people are flexing on instagram they're flexing on tick tock. for all we know uh carly did giorgio. what the [ __ ] her name on the [ __ ] always doing that renegade. dance charlie demilio dimilio sisters. right they are don't exist. i don't know have you ever. seen them some of these people. they don't dude i've i saw a somebody on instagram. once and i you know. i saw people were following them. oh you're so [ __ ] beautiful you're so good they don't it. came out they don't exist. dude it was somebody that. was made it was a rendering of of of of a person that they made and and it wasn't even. a real person and people are out there. some of them don't know but some of them. know and they're still like they're beautiful. i don't give a [ __ ] it's really wild. are you gonna get a cyber uh quad. i'm uh i i want to. get one i want to. get one you do oh it's sold. out yeah no i know but they'll make more it's sold out. immediately of course it. sold out immediately but they'll make more dude. i never get the [ __ ] when it first comes out. anyway i can't be the guy. that's [ __ ] waiting at that i don't even get like on the nike. apps i don't even i've never i've never won. i never won on because i'm always too. late i'm like i'm like at least 10. minutes late and it's like oh it's sold out. four days ago i'm like but it just came out. 10 minutes ago um but yeah dude. everybody wants elon musk. got the doug haircut. huh you saw that he just saw that. [ __ ] he got that doug. haircut elon musk just said save the shave the sides. like he was in [ __ ] like it like you know who did that the [ __ ] lead character. in gamora that i was talking about earlier. he just cut it dude. that's awesome to cut your hair. like that everyone makes fun. of it but who gives a [ __ ] he's basically kanye. but they're all the same. dude kanye west just got a [ __ ] haircut. he cut zigzags into. his whole [ __ ] head and and elon musk. was like i got you let me let me. oneup it i'll cut all the sides. off that's it it's bonkers. you see this seth rogen movie. that's coming out the [ __ ] uh um christmas. movie that's claymation where it's about two. this is how just backwards and like dude. i think you know seth. rogen's funny and [ __ ] and like the [ __ ] stuff he makes he makes some good movies this is like no knock or anything like that but i just think that once you're in that hollywood machine you start doing things and just doing them like i always say if you become too much of who you are then that's bad if people are just yesing you then that's just and you're getting everything from it you lose sense of who you are it's like um it's like uh uh how i always say uh you know nicholas cage when he first started he was just like oh you know and then later on he just now he's just oh and everyone's like he's a bad actor but he's not he's earned the right to. get that but also no director was telling him. to shut the [ __ ] up and stop doing that so how could you blame him right it's not nicholas cage's fault. i happen to [ __ ] watch him because he's really eccentric and i love him. but it's like my point. is you got to. have people in there that [ __ ] check you you got to. have friends that'll be like what are you doing. dyeing your hair purple or whatever the [ __ ] it is right. you got to check these [ __ ] otherwise you're just yes. good job yes good job good job. and they become roar. and then they're that [ __ ] version of their roar. and it's like oops too late. too late it's like [ __ ] rampage and they're crying. climbing on buildings now so my point is i think this was this. movie for [ __ ] seth rogen he does this movie that is a claymation movie about christmas. christmas which is fine but then it's like hey why can't a girl be santa. claus and this girl comes along. and she's like i want to. be santa claus but so far santa. clauses have only been old white men. and it's like is this. for kids and they say [ __ ] it a lot so who's going to. watch it adults it's claymation who's going. to watch it adults. claymation and it's a christmas. movie you're not going to. want i'm not going to. watch it with cap who is it. for so you got seth rogen playing the santa and then the the the girl like i want to. be santa too and i'm sure. she becomes santa by the end. of the show but it's like you could be santa. if you want to. anyone could be santa. if you want to. now here look i don't give a [ __ ] if santa is a woman. i don't care if santa's a small one small. person i don't care if santa's black i don't give a [ __ ] you know why. santa's not real but my point. is these people are just making movies. to i shouldn't say these people. i should say hollywood. is making movies that fits. an agenda that tries. to make this these 10. 000 people happy because they don't want. to be [ __ ] taken down and you can't do that because the majority doesn't give a [ __ ] the majority is. not going to watch. your [ __ ] and the majority is. going to be like but santa's why. now santa doesn't exist. she's not white black or asian. or indian or whatever the [ __ ] it is but it's like you can't make everybody happy. and if you try to. you're just gonna fail and that's why. the movie has one percent on. rotten tomatoes or whatever the [ __ ] is my point. also they say that if you're i mean. they were getting mad at the lady. that that played harriet tubman because she was british. she was a black woman. but she was british. and they were like oh what does. she know she's not an american. black woman so now it's getting. so specific but then they [ __ ] let a jewish person. be santa claus which is again. fine by me i don't give a [ __ ] but if you're gonna adhere to. the rules then adhere to. the [ __ ] rules if you made the rules. fit in the rules you. can't make the rules. and then all of a sudden sidestep. the rules like your [ __ ] neo you're not the one.

five sprays. one behind each ear okay all right. one in front of your neck. on your clothes that's two. but and one on the back. of your neck i mean. so because if you walk around you have a nice central. behind you you can spray. this spot right here you can spot this. right here but i don't suggest. you for different reasons. that i mentioned in other videos. oh my god the way uh first of all sprayed his literally it was like five different. places to spray all five were on the neck. imagine like being a girl. and like then like making out. with him and like kissing his neck. and just tasting a [ __ ] department. store i hate there's no. there's no cologne there's only perfume. guys who wear perfume it's just off. dude i go back to. this date my day. when i was in high school. and my uncle picked up one. time he picked up me. and my buddy and me and two other buddies. and one of them had cologne. on and we were driving. for like 10 minutes. and my uncle was driving he said all right. who's killing me with the cologne. and honestly i swear to. god his name was jeremy but it's not jeremy fragrance. it's a different jeremy he said all. right who's killing me with. the cologne he had to. open the [ __ ] windows he must apply. these five [ __ ] spritzes wand. on the neck one. on the front of the neck. one on the side of the neck. one on the side of the neck. and then one on the back. so you leave a cent trail. guys just let me smell. your pheromones men women let me. smell your pheromones because some people are just very very very bad smelling and i want. to know that you know. what i mean talk about being who you think you. should be i want to. know that i get it. deodorant is all good put it under the thing. like i wear natural scented deodorant because your boy's all natural dude. i've got no implants i [ __ ] use as minimal types. of smell shits as i need to. i got the nioxin shampoo keeping the hair. thick as [ __ ] right i got nioxin level four keeping it thick. as [ __ ] because i don't want the [ __ ] to. go bald because everybody goes bald right. mostly even chicks be losing their hair. when they're older but i'm trying to. keep my my [ __ ] to. the fullest maximum chia pet effect. so i got the nioxin [ __ ] and this [ __ ] doesn't smell. too much it smells fine. i take the [ __ ] uh i forget what deodorant i have. but it's all natural yeah it's a little bit. powdery but it doesn't have aluminium. in it you understand. it has no aluminum in it. because your boy he doesn't want. those chemicals chemicals unless of course he's eating lots of ice cream at night but he doesn't want you know i ate a little bit of gummy bears the other day but i don't normally eat candy that's processed in a lab i mean all candies processed in
