creek high isn't. coping to any wrongdoing here. by the way saying in a statement that all the student. volunteered to do this. and no faculty sta were. involved in this particular game. wow dude they're going to. double down hey all fun and games don't be up. in don't be up in toes. about it um they also raised 150k. that's the move dude. to make it a fundraiser. no matter what how what you're doing. if it's creepy or bad. just if as long as you're fundraising all. good can't really argue with it. you know yeah i was i was yeah. i was masturbating and looking through. a window oh

but you're a hero. to people who die yeah. it's going to. lymphoma research so go that's fine. i hey you exposed yourself. hey you exposed yourself in a library it doesn't matter. first of all there shouldn't be libraries. because libraries shouldn't exist. anymore because there's google. and everything but there's still libraries for some reason. second of all i got sponsors and i rais $310,000 for lymphoma. so you can put me. in jail but i'm a hero. um that is just crazy um dude. if i walked in on a fundraiser. and calvin or billy was. licking okay if it was a faculty. member's toes i would

killing everyone. what's it for it's for it's people. are out there dying from hunger. well all these people are dying. anyway um the this is amazing. i don't understand i don't i don't i don't get the foot fetish. thing ever i saw one. pair of feet once and i was like i oh i get it. i i guess i get it. they were really nice feet. but if you have a foot fetish. you just like how many nice feet. are i guess that's the thing. i don't have a foot fetish. because if you had a foot fetish. you just would basically be looking at feet. more and i don't ever look. at feet i look. at the m major regular areas. that men look at you. know um i'm like a tits personality type guy. you know what i mean. and uh but but but you know. people who like feet you. know when it's summertime they're they go. they're they're awesome they yeah oh awesome. dude let's go hey never looking up. right but i don't have a foot fetage but i saw one. pair of feet once and i go damn. those feet are real. nice okay i get foot fetish. but that was the only time. i ever was like i got a buddy. who's into feet bro. he's into to feet. like into him like loves it. and it's just like so weird. to me i mean no. judgment um isn't that a guy. that's just like that's a weird. thing like i i understand. being so see here's the thing. i used to. think that like like really big buff. bodybuilders all [ __ ] men i thought because they would just like like they were staring too much. at at each other's bodies. to to to not by mistake. do it sexually once and be like oh actually [ __ ] it let's just let's just like totally [ __ ] you know and then they just start just slamming each other in the weight. room like i i feel like really big bodybuilders have absolutely. [ __ ] bodybuilders you know what i'm talking about but uh but then i'm like i don't i don't think that like is there the kind of thing. like the rock stars who they were having sex. with so many women in the 80s. like they just started [ __ ] each other right. because that's what you do. if you had sex with thousands. and thousands and thousands of women eventually you you start. going like ah it's all the same. i'll just have sex with that. i've had sex with all of the fine. women i'm gonna have sex with a fat. one now [ __ ] it you know i'm gna do that that was funny. hey i had sex with that. hey i had sex with a small. person oh yeah really [ __ ] oh yeah oh that's crazy oh yeah hey now i'm gonna hey dude do you want to. [ __ ] that'd be hilarious. and then they just do it. and it's not even gay. it's just they've done it. all and they're just like what's it. matter cing [laughter] coming you know and uh so the tired gayness doesn't really count. as gayness straight gayness from jump. that's the real gay. dude those are the dudes that own. gayness and that's the [ __ ] but if you're just a rock. star that's [ __ ] a lot of people and then you're like yeah maybe i throw some men in there it doesn't count um i don't know. i just woke up from a little nap. it's a little dark but you guys. silly i'm still going to. send it this the guy. that made up send it [music]. oh my oh my god oh pain. oh this guy's going to. die he [music] died. well that hurt but the et. still runs so round too she's tweaked. so up north are you oh [ __ ] have you seen this. video snow's too soft nothing. could be more canadian. nothing could be more canadian. still going to send that. dude a mullet all denim. in the snow doing. that how i mean that's unbelievable. still going to send it. oh i love these oh i love these people. getting pissed it's over. the [ __ ] speed limit now i'm getting [ __ ] pissed get in my face again.
