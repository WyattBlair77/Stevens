[ __ ] yourself put a door i don't care how fancy it is i don't care how much we were supposed. to feel like jeremy renner. walking into a movie. in the [ __ ] 2035 i don't care. put a door on it. you know why ground gets wet. know why almost slip know. why you almost get a lawsuit. that's the thing i'm not gonna be the guy. who sues either that's the worst. part if i slip and cracked. my head i'm not litigious am. i litigious my babies no i'm not litigious. i was way too old. when i figure out what the word. litigious meant by the way but um yeah dude. i'm not suing so that's the thing. to have a door on. your shower so the water. doesn't leak out and also but these are the worst. showers and that besides the door. here's the thing if you're gonna have a door on your i got rules. you [ __ ] if you're gonna have no door on your shower. you have a [ __ ] shower head. that's attached to. the wall not the ceiling okay these [ __ ] shower heads. that come out from the ceiling. or a bullish [ __ ] they're disguised as the nice but they are not nice and let me tell you why dude cuz when you take a shower and guys with long hair. and chicks know you don't always want to. [ __ ] wash your hair ok if you're bald doesn't matter if you got short hair doesn't really matter but if you got the ceiling [ __ ] thing and it's shooting down on your head it's you can't you can't get your [ __ ] it you can't really position your head you can see in the video podcast but you can't really position your head to. not get it on your [ __ ] hat hair and and here's the other thing to. people like wear a shower. cap which i'm all for i. [ __ ] i'll wear a shower cap. i don't give a [ __ ] dude. that's not just for ladies i'll. wear that [ __ ] but when you're waking up early. in the morning you're not thinking where's my stuff. you're not thinking where's the shower. cap where's this where's that. you just get in the [ __ ] shower. okay so put your [ __ ] it's not nice i don't care. if it looks sleeker or whatever. put the shower head on the sai. on the wall dude. and if you've got no door you. better put it on the wall. because that [ __ ] top showerhead from the ceiling constantly spills out. into the [ __ ] outside of the bathroom. and what were what you're trying. to do is you're trying. to make us litigious you're trying. to make us litigious [ __ ] why would you try to. make us litigious daisen hey no. not the days inn there's some [ __ ] like the [ __ ] soho grand would do it or the mandarin hotel in san francisco you did you trying to. make us a little teddy suit. yo [ __ ] nice hotels you trying. to [ __ ] make us dead. you said i i mean. i don't who the [ __ ] would listen to. this podcast is what i want. to know i talk but i swear i talk. about the hardhitting issues. this is a real [ __ ] you can go out there you can listen to. your [ __ ] political [ __ ] you can listen to. what's going on you. can listen to. the new york times podcasts. you can listen to. you know sam harris and all the real.

showerheads and putting them on the wall because i'm just trying to [ __ ] fight for a better society dude there's all this extra [ __ ] that people are trying to do that make the world makes the world worse keep it real babies keep it the way it was we figured out how to do it we figured out how to do it don't let art and fanciness [ __ ] up with the way we do it because this is how this is how we done went it's all of the days and then you come in here and you get autistic and [ __ ] it up that's what happens you think i mean cool but you're not being cool and then you step in fall and

the golden girls that show. that somebody gave me a shirt. that had the golden girls on. it a fan gave it. to me and that show. i used to. watch i was talking about my grandparents the other day. with my family and i was thinking about how the difference between them. and all that and i have one grandmother left. are the other ones passed away. and i really liked all my grandparents and i was thinking about how my grandma. dottie felt more like a mom. to me not not more. like i'm on them than my mom. my mom felt like my mom. but felt more motherly to. me and my grandma carmela. is italian i felt more. like a friend you know my grandma. dottie is still alive ermand i still love my grandma. carmela died years ago. from cancer from cancer. because everybody gets cancer and then we got to. figure out how to. cure cancer because everyone dies. of cancer so that's [ __ ] a big problem but she was felt more like my friend. cuz we used to. have like sleepovers i mean. my brother used to. go over there and we would watch hunter. and the golden girls and i [ __ ] loved it i loved the golden girls. dude and my grandma. would always be like come on time. to watch the golden girls. and we'd all like i mean. i was like [ __ ] seven and my brother. was like four i would go and watch the golden girls. with my grandma and i loved it. dude i loved it because my grandma. i don't know why i loved it. i thought it was funny. but how weird is that that a sevenyearold loved the golden girls. you know i just jump in a bed. and i remember that [ __ ] blanket. to that she had it was the the flimsiest. blanket it wouldn't keep you warm. at all but i would go in there. and it would be my brother. in her and we would just be and we would just fall asleep. we watched hunter and the glue. watch golden girls and then hunter came on. and they would always fall asleep. the end of hunter and we loved it. dude and my grandma. had a swordfish hanging in her basement. and i was scared. the [ __ ] outta me i would never go in her basement. cause it was a goddamn swordfish. in there but it was so fun. to do that and now when the i had a fan. give me the golden girls. shirt i made me think of my grandma. and i was like oh that's so [ __ ] sweet. that you know the fan. didn't even know that but but i now. i think of my grandma. when i see this shirt. and i loved my grandma. but i don't remember much of things i never really remember [ __ ] i have a really bad memory and i remember that like i don't remember like one time when my grandma was dying. she was staying at my parents. house and i went up to. her room and i was like i know she's gonna die. soon i should sit and talk with her. and like learn about her. and all that stuff and i said i talked with her. for like over an hour. maybe two hours about how her life was and how she met grandpa. and how she you know. different parts of her life. and i was like i got to. remember all this stuff and i don't i don't. remember i have a bad memory but i remember i did that. i remember i oh i connected with her. so that's kind of important. and that was really sweet. but i do remember the [ __ ] and watching her watching the golden girls. with her and i do remember watching i do remember that. [ __ ] blanket man i liked that blanket. and i liked the golden girls. and i loved being at her house. for some i don't know. i don't know it's weird. what you like is a [ __ ] kid what you remember i wonder. if i brother liked it. too i should ask. him we're gonna make a [ __ ] rocket ship. is what i'm trying to. say but yeah i don't know once. i was at my grandma's house. and for some reason we thought it. was a good idea to. take mud and throw it. at the house next door. i don't know why we were little kids. i didn't even think about how it might be bad. and that people came out from next. door and they [ __ ] when you yelled at us they were like you gonna go to. jail we're gonna call the cops. on you and then i ran inside. crying and i was like they're gonna call. the cops and my family. was there and they thought it was so funny. they were like they're not gonna call it. con i could get a rat can we get arrested. like an actor get [ __ ] arrested. for throwing mud at a house. you're [ __ ] 9 ha ha ha man. we let over they've [ __ ] laughed at me dude. wow [ __ ] it's crazy. remember that [ __ ] seems like another lifetime you ever. think about your guys you're a kid. when you're a kid you don't even.
