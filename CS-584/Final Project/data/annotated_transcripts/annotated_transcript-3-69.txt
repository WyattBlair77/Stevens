can't wait to. do uh these dates phoenix was uh unbelievably fun and it was great. and the energy there was fantastic. and um honestly that's why he's got some color. and that's why he looks good. because he's got new life. in him dude he's got some new life. in him and uh i went swimming with the boy. and the family and it was just great. but i was in phoenix and uh we'll have that. vlog coming out on the more crystalia. channel later on but um yeah we did. phoenix um we all went as a family. i brought a bunch of i brought craig. conant killer michael noche killer and i brought the family. calvin kane and kristen came and we were in phoenix and um yeah i mean. jesus i don't even know what to. say man um it was the first out of town. gig that i did that i took a flight to. do um in three years i mean. the last time i did. it i think was the last show. i did was somewhere in florida. i believe before the pandemic. just in 2019 um so it's been three. years um and uh it's just been super uh i don't know. man i i i've been doing a lot. of clubs and stuff and i i didn't. even realize that this was the biggest venue. that i'd done i mean. this this seats 2. 700 seats or something. and we did two of them. so it was absolutely insane. it was in the round. i've never played in the round. before except for the one. time it was the same. theater that i um that i went. to go uh break into. brian callan's set um it's in the round. and that celebrity theater is absolutely amazing. i mean it really is dude. and um i like playing in the round. it's different though because you know. i do hear when when you're in the round. when you do a theater in the round. you and you do a joke. you can definitely see the people. that you're looking at laughing. the hardest and they laugh harder. than the people behind you which is very interesting. and very interesting and i know. that's very interesting because when i was telling it. to ivan gets rid of before. this show he said oh that's very interesting. so that's very interesting. and um the celebrity theater was great. though man the energy. was [ __ ] bonkers you could see on my instagram i posted a video um and the vlog's coming in and i'll go you know you'll see that too but like at the end i brought kristen and calvin. and all and the other comedians on. stage and calvin came up. with this headphones kristin got. him little headphones or uh. i guess earmuff headphones. that they're quieter noise reduction headphones. you know whatever the [ __ ] and uh he came out. with them on and everyone was [ __ ] screaming. so loud and then they fell off and he started. crying so it was too. loud so it's a good thing. good on christopher getting those earmuff. headphones um but my god man i just feel honestly so grateful and i know i say that a lot now but i just really do like i mean those fan. man those people the people who came out in phoenix those people you guys are something special like you guys just i mean when i took that stage and you guys were just [ __ ] stood up and started screaming. i mean you [ __ ] i feel like i saw all of you we were all together. right that's what i'm talking about. when i build this. log cabin man. you're all invited we gotta build. one big [ __ ] log cabin you know some of those dudes at the meet and greet. were [ __ ] big and burly they can help you know i saw some tall drinks. of water come to. the meet and greet. dude very very very personable very. nice people at the meet and greet. they said we know everyone always says this. no matter what town i'm. in i know this place. sucks but thanks for coming. no i love it dude. that's why i'm there. i picked phoenix one because it's one of my favorite places. to go and it's so [ __ ] hot and i love it man. you step out you could put [ __ ] fry. an egg on that concrete. but i loved it dude. and everyone was complaining you know. mike linochie another comedian that came with me. he was like it's so hot. and he's sweating no. matter what dude it's got to. be [ __ ] 69 degrees for. him but uh we stayed at kristen's uh mom's. house which is my new favorite thing. to [ __ ] do on the road is to. be in a house man. i think i'm off this hotel's. thing but uh we got to. the house and it was just nice. as [ __ ] we might do some airbnbs you know what i mean. just hire some security to. stand outside just with [ __ ] bigass shotguns. really small dudes with bigass. shotguns i want to. hire you know a lot. of guys hire big security. guys i want to. hire [ __ ] small persons just [ __ ] small small the smallest small people we can find but like 40 years old but like super like you know small and like you know what i mean like like a small person like i'm you know what i'm talking about right like i can't say the you do not but you do know what i'm talking about but like they're big almost as big as a shotgun like they have to if you try to break in the airbnb because you know crystallia is there then you've got they drag the shotguns over and they say you know hey guys actually you got to step off the lawn crystally is here and then they say to the other small person help me out and then the hell one of them holds the trigger and the other guy holds the [ __ ] barrel like a bazooka and they go step off the lawn baby and um so yeah but it was really nice we stayed at her house my linoci and his girl stayed there and then craig conan no he didn't actually the cameraman sam stayed but um and it was [ __ ] nice to it he likes the air at 69 i like the air at 78 and we compromised on 72 because it's extra hot in phoenix and i loved it dude i just love that heat people are like huh the heat i'm like nope dude make me evaporate i love it i want my lips cracked that's the only thing that bad about the heat is dry heat made my lips crack and i could barely take it i didn't take a poop the whole time i don't take poops and when i go and the shit's over 75 when the shit's over 80 degrees outside i don't take poops my hand just goes like this i'm all good i'm all good man i'll sit on the toilet sometimes i think i need to go you know what comes out this sound me up nothing dude nothing the anus just goes meow like it's hitting a note ha that's what it does no poop comes out i don't even think calvin i think calvin like father like son dude but calvin came with me to the show and everyone came with me to the show and it was just so beautiful man he kept saying ah yuck it's time that dad does work he needs to work on talking but. dude it was so sweet. and i hugged him before. i went on stage. and he gave me a high. five before i went. on stage and i walked out. there and i just [ __ ] saw like kristen holding him. in the sometimes when i was doing. jokes and i saw [ __ ] it was just beautiful man. i love seeing you guys. you guys came out with the life. rips apparel i love. it all right enough. of this man i'm just super grateful. and it was

like no no you know. i don't know man let's just talk. we have a good i'm like dude. you turn on some tv and you also talk. though because if you do that you get the best. of both worlds and then we ordered. food and it was terrible. definitely got cancer from it. but we got you know. it was great we're sitting at my [ __ ] motherinlaw's house. eating [ __ ] dirty burgers. and just watching uh this movie catch and release with jennifer garner. in it and uh i ended up falling. asleep on the couch with me. which means one thing your boy's peaceful. dude if he's falling. asleep on the couch he's peaceful. especially in a room full of six people. dude and i went to. fall asleep and before. i knew it the lights. were out and i'm waking up. and mike lenocchi's girlfriend is. waking me up and i say huh. and she says do you want to. go to bed you fell asleep. out here you're snoring and i got pissed. but couldn't get mad at her. because she's not my girlfriend when someone's sleeping

what i mean mostly the problems. are me right. because i'm me and my brain's [ __ ] up but mostly it's me. but also it can be both. of us but even if it's sometimes. her it's mostly me. right it turns back around. on you women can never really get in trouble. in your relationship you know. because they have that whole thing. where they start crying and then you go. like this i'm sorry. and then you go no and you're just like great. dude and in their head. they're just whoa here he comes. watch out he's [ __ ] gaslighting whoa here he comes he's a piece of [ __ ] a douchebag whoa here's here he

to bed and then [ __ ] the tv was out the lights. were out and i go like this. man i just want to. be asleep here but i'm not you. know what do it now dude. do it now do it [ __ ] now it was like a guy had a gun to. my head and i knew i [ __ ] up do it now do it now do it in my head and i just got up within one fell swoop. i went into the [ __ ] bathroom. took out my contacts. and i [ __ ] fell into. bed dude and i went off to. dreamland and then i woke up and guess what happened. i woke up and i walk out. to the kitchen and kristen is with calvin and calvin is chilling. doing stuff like you know. he was playing with a dinosaur. that he really liked a trex. and uh i walk out there. and i go i play with the trex. a little bit but i'm very very i don't. when i wake up dude. my hair looks like the [ __ ] a german at the end of a movie in a [ __ ] james bond or end of james bond movie right like it's it's it's messed up. it looks like the plane's. going down it looks like i'm about to. go no and it's about to. zoom in and then my face. is gonna illuminate with an explosion. that's what my hair looks like when i wake up. a german at the end of a james. bond movie and um [laughter] and then my glasses on but i oh i first but i keep one. eye for some reason when i wake up. i keep one eye [ __ ] like half shut i don't know if i'm acting in real life from like acting more tired than i am. you know sometimes you're dramatic and [ __ ] but i walked out. and then i walked back. into the bedroom and now i'm in arizona. okay i walked back into. the bedroom all right now you're gonna be as confused. as i was when i tell you this. story okay i walk back into. the bedroom and i'm gonna go plop. down onto the bed. again and before i go. plop down into. the bed into the bed. again all of a sudden searing pain. in my big toe and i don't mean. like i stepped on a nail. i mean like uh hey why does this. pain keep growing every second and now i get so scared. because i'm in a foreign. land i'm in the foreign. land of phoenix right if i felt that pain here. in la i'd probably just sit down. and be like oh my god but i was in phoenix so i thought what's happening. my whole world is not what my world. usually is because i'm [ __ ] however many miles away 800 miles away from my house. so it could be anything. we're in phoenix is it. a scorpion i mean. this pain was searing dude. and i go oh oh oh like that. really loud i go oh oh oh and krista says what happened. and i sit down and i say i don't know. like that like a will ferrell. character and it gets harder. and it hurts more. and i said what's happening. what did i step. on i stepped on a b. i looked down it's a [ __ ] b on the [ __ ] calvin's grandma's carpet belly. up [music] dude. the bee is already dead but just [ __ ] waiting to. sting me dude my [ __ ] big toe felt like it was lopped off and i looked down and a bee's [ __ ] sleeping with the fishes [music] there's a stinger in my foot sometimes you find out what kind of a man you really are dude now how do i step on a bee inside how does it happen as a matter of fact i want to. ask you audience of congratulations. faithful babies future log cal. cabin residents future tall grass sitters dressed in white sharing. ideas i want to. ask you count how many bees. you seen inside me. one belly up on. grandma's carpet dude i forgot how bad bee sting. hurt i forgot that i forgot. about that i forgot about. that dude i forgot how bad bee. stings hurt did you know. that i've been stung by a bee. three times all right in my life. once no wait twice no four. times once i was a kid and i was near. a tree and i had my shirt. off and all of a sudden i felt that searing sw that sweet. searing pain on my back. and i ran faster than ever. back to my house. i didn't know what happened. my mom said he got stung. by a bee that was one number two was when i was younger in new jersey. still both in new jersey i was getting out. of a pool at the [ __ ] public. pool i got out i put my tummy. down on the [ __ ] uh ledge. all of a sudden that sweet. sweet searing pain on my tummy. screamed a lot with goggles. on ran to my parents. it was fine i was like nine okay. you could scream a lot. when you're nine number three. i was at jiu jitsu okay. i leave jiu jitsu barefoot. out i've told this story in my pockets. before i step on something. it hurts doesn't hurt. that bad though i drive all the way. home to burbank and then i realized holy [ __ ] did i step on a syringe i'm scared i was in [ __ ] west hollywood and in a parking lot and there's [ __ ] addicts there so i drove all the way back to. check for the syringe i'm like i'm never gonna find. it and there was no. lie a bee belly. up on the parking. lot and the fourth time in my life. was last saturday on grandma's rug. and that one hurt so [ __ ] much i can't even believe it. so it's fine and i the one. thing i said that. makes me know i'm a good person. when i got [ __ ] stung by a by a [ __ ] bee that by a dead bee is oh man thank god it was me you know that's the kind of guy i'm dude it's the kind of guy i am thank god it was me because i didn't want it to. be calvin right and then so when i was like holding my foot i was like thank god. it was me it could have. been calvin and then i [ __ ] made sure because krista was there. i said or you like i wouldn't want. it to be her i'd rather. it be me but my heart. was all i you know think about [ __ ] calvin. getting stung by people we don't even. know if he's allergic yet. calvin could get stung by. a bee and all of a sudden [ __ ] blow up right so thank god it was me that [ __ ] bee and then i walked outside and mike linoche was there dude and he was just like yeah you know he's like so oh so he stepped on a bee so what it doesn't hurt. it's dead you can't get stung by. a dead bee ain't wrong. no images no women's the women's the whims you can do it and he didn't know that so i taught him a lesson. so i'm an educator and also he's dumb. um so yeah i did that. and i made it through. dude times get hard. but i made it through. ah the phoenix trip they made me think about [ __ ] like that kings of pain. right isn't that what it's called. the kings of pain show. we talked about it earl. yeah dude they're doing a season. two of it it's on like something. like the outdoors channel or whatever the [ __ ] there's like you know what i mean discovery. where the guys just take a scorpion. and they just [ __ ] put it on their forearm and wait to. the scorpion stick dude. i don't know how they do. that that b was enough. for me what level was. is b i don't know they rate it. though they get hit [ __ ] bit by like a [ __ ] python or whatever the poisonous one is

[ __ ] really colorful cartoon on some streaming service i guess netflix he downloaded it and he's like all he's doing is playing with the brightness. of it i look. and it's just going bright. and dark bright and dark. and i look and he's just [ __ ] i don't even know. how to do it. but he's sitting there just [ __ ] you know he's already more technologically advanced than i am. on an ipad and um and i'm watching. him do it and he's doing it. for like a [ __ ] the whole flight. and i'm sitting there and i keep hearing. now now you know how loud a [ __ ] plane is right. like it's just it's always humming it's never not. humming if a plane's not humming you're about to. die but you're on the plane. you're 30 000 feet in the air. and i hear humming but i also hear and then for a while. i don't hear it. so i'm like what the [ __ ] where is that is it. in my head how close would somebody have to. be to you if you're on a plane. and then you hear that. was the exact noise ah [ __ ] yeah dude dude i'm so comfortable during this. podcast that i'll sneeze. i don't get insecure. [ __ ] yeah dude you understand how happy that makes me i'm so comfortable that i i think oh i got to. sneeze and then i don't think uh oh i think we'll let you know no just roll with it dude because i'm wrong what you see is what you get and that's my duty to. you guys because this is a cult. i would never [ __ ] not sneeze. for you [ __ ] yeah dude sneeze with me. if you really respect someone you'll. sneeze around you're around you'll sneeze. around them but anyway um i did that for you. and you know it's like i don't want to. be like you're welcome. but it's a gift and like it's all good. so i'm sitting there and now the [ __ ] flight is an hour. and five minutes by the way. airlines just say like an hour. you don't need to. like how long is a flight. they're always so smug. with it 111. okay you know just say it's gonna be about an hour. you know the flight time. to denver is currently. three hours and 23. minutes all right dude. what do you think like i'm you're gonna. it's gonna be 325 and i'm going. to be like oh you know. you gotta [ __ ] you lied. so i hear and i'm like all right. where is it you know. what i mean and i'm getting. [ __ ] and i but i'm like i think the guy in front of me. is making that noise so i do. the thing where like appear i'm in the one. seat you know i'm in the one. row seat because i'm in first class. and i [ __ ] look and i don't mean to. [ __ ] brag but you know what i mean no dents and so i [ __ ] look over to. the crack of the inside. and the and the chair and and i think i'm going. to say something to. him if he's making this. noise and i look and he's watching something on his phone. and it's set up and i look and i think well what's he watching. right and it's in [ __ ] it's got spanish. subtitles on it so i'm like the guy [ __ ] maybe doesn't even speak english so now i can't even [ __ ] say anything. to him right. but guess what dude. is a universal language. so i'm pissed in all the languages. with but it's like it's like shooting through the [ __ ] hum of the airplane you know what i mean it's like not it's not loud or soft. enough but it's just that. so i'm like i got to. see what the [ __ ] this guy's doing so i think i don't want to. be a [ __ ] i'm no [ __ ] i gotta lean. forward and if he sees. me who cares right. so i lean forward and and i and i can't see it because i'm like he's just gonna [ __ ] see me look at his mouth but i didn't want to. get up and walk pretend to. go to the bathroom. and come back and see if he was doing it. because first of all the timing is wrong and then also the timing may be wrong. but then also he's making me do all this. extra work because of this. [ __ ] [ __ ] sound on me and i should be able to. do what the [ __ ] i want i don't need to. be getting some extra steps because of this. guy's mouth sucking which i don't even. know if that's what the noise is right. so all this stuff's going. on in my head right. and i'm like great i can't. lean forward hard enough to. see because he's like [ __ ] slumped over watching this [ __ ] and i can't see this way and i can't see this way so i'm like you know what i'm gonna do because i'm a [ __ ] badass i'm gonna take my phone i'm gonna put it in the camera mode face it in the selfie right selfie mode and then i'm gonna [ __ ] just go like this in front of him to. see what the [ __ ] he's doing dude. and i want you to. [ __ ] know deep down in your heart. that that's how gangster i am. dude if you're making mouth. noises but it's not confirmed. and you're sitting in front of me. on an airplane or anywhere. and i'm you know and you're trying. to get me to. do some extra work. to [ __ ] walk forward and look back. to see if you're doing it. i'm not gonna do that. dude i'm sitting down and i'm chill. [ __ ] axed i'll [ __ ] put my phone in selfie mode. and i'll put it in front of your face. and act like we're having a moment. dude that we have to. capture so that's what i did. dude i put it in selfie. mode you know i got a little bit of ner you know you get nerves. the whole thing about the no. fear it's like what. if he's gonna see oh no. don't have fear be a man. about it dude. i felt fear i felt. nervous but a real man. doesn't feel no fear a. real man feels fear and still perseveres and i've learned all about that this past two years so this guy i mean his immense meat phone activated in selfie mode moved it forward way in front of his face and i'm like he's going to. see because i didn't angle. it right at first and i'm angry. i'm trying to get the angle. and i get it and i and bro. oh whoopsy daisy i didn't even tell you the phone. was [ __ ] recording video he's got evidence too it wasn't just in selfie. mode jokes on you he's got evidence too who's picking his teeth. with the razor hey bud first of all why second of all did you get it. on the plane how'd you get it. how to get it. on the plane dude. also now i'm recording a guy. who doesn't speak english sticking razors. in his mouth trouble but i got it. and you know what dude. i didn't even get his face. in it because i'm good with the [ __ ] camera you know. so i'll put it up. here in the [ __ ] congratulations. and i'll show you but he had a [ __ ] razor and he was picking his teeth. for so long and i didn't say. anything about him but i recorded the video and i sent. it to all my friends.

talk about me. crystalia who's that the petty guy yeah no. but he knows the deal. no i know but i'm saying picking your teeth. in public is always it's just it's like it. honestly for real instead of

for this world so that's what happened that was annoying. on the plane and then when i went when i landed. i had to go change. calvin because he took a [ __ ] poop in his diaper. finally because we were out of that. dry zone as soon as we landed. he just [ __ ] you know dropped some pebbles. out and i had to. go change him because uh kristen had to. i don't remember where she was but i [ __ ] went to. uh the men's room to. go change them and there. was like no changing area. there was just like a ledge. like come on airport. get it together you know. it was just a ledge. it wasn't even a [ __ ] there was like no it wasn't comfy. at all and i was like come here. buddy and i had to. put him up there and i was like can you sit down. and he sat down on this. hard ledge and then he had he's like no. i want dinosaur and he had his dinosaur. and so i was like that's okay. and i took i got to. take her pants down and undid it. and right and it's his [ __ ] father and son i'm changing his diaper. in the uh bathroom and i hear and there's a lesson. for yeah me by is what i mean. and i hear this. dude in the bathroom. and he's just like god damn. man those shoes look comfy. as [ __ ] i just hear some guy say god. damn man those shoes look comfy. as [ __ ] and it's too far away. to be about me. so i'm pissed and i'm not pissed. that he's not talking about how comfy. my shoes look but it's just like don't be that. loud to somebody you either. know or don't know in a [ __ ] public. bathroom and it was that loud. too also don't it's so echoey. in bathrooms he just says god. damn no shoes look comfy. as hell just like that. okay and the guy and then another guy says quieter. oh yeah they're pretty comfy. but you know i like him. he's like yeah man they're really nice. i really like them and it's just loud. as [ __ ] and i'm changing. calvin and i'm focusing on them. you know i'm just like buddy. you know hold on and he's starting. to cry and i'm like buddy. just hold on your dinosaur. it's okay let me get it. let me clean you up. all right cool now stand up. here we go and then i turn around. as i turn around i see. this [ __ ] the two guys a black dude with steel. blue eyes i mean this guy had to. be 50 but boy dude he looked [ __ ] handsome as [ __ ] and he said hey you're a good dad man and he had the same voice as the guy who said god damn those shoes. look comfy as hell and i was upset. and then when he said that. and he looked at me. and he said you're a good. dad it made me feel better. than [ __ ] anything so i was upset. at the [ __ ] tsecond guy and then i got a little bit perturbed when the guy was screaming. in the bathroom but then it turned out. that that guy was the guy. that gave me a compliment. and not only a compliment. but the best comment compliment. a father could have and if the old warmer side. and behind him the guy with the comfy. shoes 75 years old and just looks at me and goes like this yep. and gives me a thumbs. up dude i'm walking on sunshine. oh it's bound to. feel good and almost i actually almost cried. in the [ __ ] bathroom dude and it would have been okay because calvin. was crying too [ __ ] yeah a black dude with steel. blue eyes and a [ __ ] old white dude with a com shoes comfy as hell oh my god they didn't know each other but they made friends in the bathroom. and then they made friends. with me just unfucking. believable life is great if you just [ __ ] you know what i mean if you focus on all these moments if you just focus on them and you really understand what you're going through and living inside your body and not sleepwalking through life you know what i mean it's just beautiful because i was sleepwalking through life for so long and now i just [ __ ] walls down like the star wars shits i just feel good dude you know what sometimes the you know the [ __ ] gets to. me like the mundane stuff. in life with the teeth. sucking and you know. some days i'd have bad days but then i [ __ ] you know i just think about how great you gotta [ __ ] life rips man that's why i always say this dude but it does man this guy came up to. me after my show in phoenix in the meet and greet. and he was like yo man. i just gotta tell you dude. you you know my buddy. dot my buddy uh died. he he i can't remember what he said. but he i don't think it. was suicide but he said my buddy. died earlier this year. and uh you know your podcast. helped me get through it it was like i was really sad. and like it just like you really saved. me this year um and um i don't know if he you know i'll just be [ __ ] candid with you because it's not like i'm [ __ ] airing this guy out but it was just a guy i'm talking about that you don't know who he is but he was like i don't think i'd be here if it wasn't for your podcast and you know he was probably just speaking hyperbole but um i said to. him i was like you know he he got a little bit like emotional. like his voice started cracking. and i gave him a hug. and i said uh i'm i'm i'm really sorry. to hear that about your friend. but i'm glad you're still here. and then we hugged and i said and in his ear. i said life rips man. and and it does dude. you know because life can't. be good without the bad. you know what i'm talking. about if it was all good. if it's all good it's not. good right this. i thought life was all good. until the bad happened and then i realized how good life. was you know that's so [ __ ] true like you know you sit there and you think you you watch comedians you you know you watch comedians and some of them aren't that good and you're like these guys are terrible. you know you might watch a comedian. this is awful but then you see a guy. that just crushes and you're like oh yeah. and you appreciate him. more because you [ __ ] realize stand up. is hard and the cream rises. to the top and the good. moments in life can't rise. to the top if there are no. other moments he says while sipping. on that purple straw life. is i always think about that. thing where chris rock said. life is longer than a [ __ ] you know people say life is short i always thought that was so funny. and it is but like when you get older. like it [ __ ] you really think about things like this poor kate. spade by the way i mean. i know she she uh hung herself. what was it like three years. ago but the [ __ ] what was it ultra beauty. that like put out an email. that was like they put out a new fragrance. and it was and it like the tagline. was come hang with kate. spade so uncouth it's one. of those things that's so bad. and such an oversight and mistake. where you're like did they mean. to and of course they're getting. dragged online because everyone's [ __ ] just wants them to. you know this place should be out. of business and obviously they didn't mean. to do it because who the [ __ ] would do that. right it's not like their [ __ ] uh company is run. by a menace although maybe it is because i watched a little bit about. i watched some documentary. not about not about the ultra beauty. but about like big corporations. i watched the documentary. you watch a documentary. about big corporations dude. it's the most depressing [ __ ] because people are like what would i watch the other day it was on hbo. max i don't remember dude. something about wall street. oh it was about the [ __ ] gamestop thing where they did the gamestop the gamestop uh where everyone put money into. gamestop and gamestop exploded and then and then it [ __ ] up. the whole economy like people [ __ ] lost their houses. because game stock stock was going. up how [ __ ] ridiculous is that just a [ __ ] video game brick. and mortar video game store. where in a world where everyone. can download video games just obviously failing. and people on reddit at wall. street bets were just like let's just actually see if we can make people lose. homes [ __ ] the man and so they [ __ ] they just started [ __ ] it up and then robin hood the app the the tr the trading app came in and was like we're actually gonna cease it you know and uh but people lost their homes and [ __ ] just because everyone was buying gamestop and then like and then gamestop uh is still gonna go to. the [ __ ] wayside you know but i was watching this thing and these people on this documentary were just like you know if i could have a little part of just you know [ __ ] these guys on wall street i would love to. have that i would love. to be a part of that. just [ __ ] the man and you're just like huh. everyone's so mad at people with money. and i'm not saying that right. or wrong i have no [ __ ] idea i'm not gonna pretend i know any side of anything right because how do you know unless you're in the [ __ ] thing like i don't know how evil these guys are sir bernie madoff right he went to. jail for 150 years for doing all that. [ __ ] but like i don't know how i don't know this [ __ ] like people say the guy who did the [ __ ] uh we work is a crook he's out he's not he's not jealous. he's got [ __ ] 20 million dollars it's like okay but i don't know and then all and then also he's not a crook but then [ __ ] what's her name the the theranos girl. she is a crook i don't know this. is like they did the same. thing but one of them. had to do with you know. lying about curing cancer so i guess. that's worse i don't know. and everyone's out there with their [ __ ] opinion. and everyone's out there making documentaries. with these people who have an opinion. that when they take down. the man and i don't know. who's right but that's what's up. all i'm saying is don't push me. right don't push me. we got that [ __ ] merch up in the store. don't push me crystallite dot com. and we going to. many many different cities boston cheyenne. denver savannah rally raleigh sorry. whoops rockford peoria and peoria. and new york it's a little shop. of ours just did a little [ __ ] ditty for you oakland california stockton washington d.c and atlanta georgia dude i'm gonna try and get bob to. come out [ __ ] blb is gonna come out. in my [ __ ] atlanta show you said you heard it here first dude. i'm gonna make him come wait. pause pause i do that i say pause. sometimes um god it's so funny. but when you do if you're a comedian. and you do stand. up and then there's a black audience. and you make a gay. joke they'll laugh that you could be killing. if you make a gay joke. with a black audience they'd be like there's nah nah. nah they do not [ __ ] with gay. humor dude nah b nah. that's too far b. that's what they do yeah. dude you'd be crushing. talking about the kitchen. just [ __ ] crushing doing some kitchen. humor yeah and you ever. use a [ __ ] black and decker.
