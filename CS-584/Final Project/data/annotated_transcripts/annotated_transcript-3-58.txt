loves salmon did. you know that dude he loves. salmon like loves it i want. salmon and then i'm eating sam. and he says i could try. some one time i was in a a car. with [ __ ] man you know how you remember stuff but you only kind of like half. remember it i was in a car. with my friend's mom and his sister. but my friend wasn't there. for some reason they needed to. pick me up from some park and i had these candies. and i was sitting in the back. seat and the sister was sitting in the front seat. she was younger than me. and then the mom was sitting in the front seat. with the driver's seat obviously and i was eating. the candies i was such a dick. even at [ __ ] up what i had to. be eight and she turned around. and saw me eating the candies. and she said i could have one. and i judged that the mom. didn't hear her say that. and because she said i could have one. and not can i have one. i said that's not how you ask for something. he's a dick even. when he's 80 rings true. dude i said that's not how you do it. we went back to. one runner sting because we got [ __ ] flagged on the two it was too much. of the song hey what do you want. dude so we now we have one. dude i haven't get rid of fix. did it i haven't get rid of one. one fire zero um but yeah dude. she said i could have one. i said that's not how you ask for something. and then she dude i was eight. i was such a dick. she was probably six and then and then i think she said. it right or no no. then i said i said you're supposed. to say can i have one. please and i think i don't really remember the rest of it. but i think i i like to. think i was a good. guy and i gave it to. her because oh [ __ ] i'm an [ __ ] dude wow you remember the [ __ ] [ __ ] you used to. do as a kid when i was a kid. i was in preschool. or i was in k. whatever it was it. was mrs pillsbury's is what it. was called it was the place. where the [ __ ] lady squeezed. my cheeks too hard once. because i went down the slide. wrong all good she squeezed. my cheeks too hard if i ever. become a serial killer that's the thing. i'm gonna go that's the defense. i'm gonna go with well. did you know that the defendant. had his squeeze has his cheeks squeezed. too hard when he was at mrs. pillsbury's no oh no i'm some or the order. order order um she squeezed my cheeks. real hard i didn't tell my mom two years. later and she said you should have told it. you should have told us that i didn't though. and it's fine she squeezed. my cheeks and i'm fine. about it but um it hurt. and it scared me. but it's fine i'm fine. about it and um she's a cheek. squeezer and so she uh she did that. and then in that same. place wherever the school. was it had like a kitchen. and [ __ ] how is it a school but anyway it had a kitchen and was it just a house was i just at someone's house. what the [ __ ] is mrs. pillsbury's it was in new jersey. i don't know it was also. the 80s so it was completely. it literally could have been like some [ __ ] somebody's house now they would never do that. they would never have school. at somebody's house but um i went there. and they i was eating. snack time and somebody was eating wafers and she was eating the waiver so little i talked about this before my podcast she was eating away. for so little and i and i was it was great. and dude i was like a young. larry david i was like [ __ ] nine just just in my own career. enthusiasm and uh and i was looking at her. and i finally couldn't take it. i said how come you're eating. such small bites and she said. because it lasts. longer that way oh dude. and i got angry because i think yeah but don't you want. more in your mouth you want. more satisfaction all at once. rather than [ __ ] spanned out for too. long also it gets old dude. i want the see this. is why i'm an addict and she's not and she's got a [ __ ] beautiful life and a family and everything and there's never been any sort of and never been done and now because she takes small bites of her way. for his [ __ ] yeah dude i would take that whole. wafer and just run. around like a tree trimmer just [ __ ] it dude all of it i want all the flavor. in my mouth at once. swallow and then move the [ __ ] on dude. that's how i eat that's how i eat i'm not as bad. as mike linocchi the guy who the guy the the comedian. michael noche which i hang with a lot. he [ __ ] eats [ __ ] and he's like we got to. finish this food to. move on to. the dessert we finished the dessert. we got to move. on to the next. thing i'm not like that. i enjoy it but i do it. quickly dude but i'll eat that [ __ ] like a tree trimmer or a [ __ ] log trim. or whatever and she was just taking her sweet. time it's like what are we doing. dude it's like it's like it's like i was talking to. my uncle the other day. about uh uh about uh western medicine. versus eastern medicine and he was like well. you know western medicine's good but also if you go to. the [ __ ] eastern like these if you have a bruise in asia. and you go to. a doctor they like america. they'll just like ice the bruise and like just local. write locally around the bruise or just try to. get the bruise as small as it. can but in the in in the east though. if you're in asia. they'll try to. spread the bruise out so there's less pain. all over your body and i say yeah. i don't know don't you think that. western medicine though it's like there's science and stuff. involved and he said yeah but who's done medicine. longer and then that was when i was just like okay. well i don't i don't even want. to you know i don't even want. to have that okay sure if you're that. you know what i mean. if you're that if you're that. i'm never that hell bent. on any argument unless it's like literally about the dumbest [ __ ] and this is was a little bit too medical. for me to really and so that's what. she was doing she was. spreading the bruise out for you know and i'm just like a western that's what she was doing. with the with the wafer just trying. to make it last longer. throughout her whole body and me. i'm more of a [ __ ] western medicine. type dude you know i'm the guy. who goes in that. just eats the [ __ ] wafers all at once and just has a flavor. explosion in his mouth um that is what i want though. dude it's crazy it's crazy. it's crazy how much i i do that. i think about my ticket. sales i look at how many tickets. i sold and i'm like how do i get more how do i [ __ ] sell 10 more tickets. how do i sell 30. more tickets how do i sell you. know what i mean and then once i can add another show. like i [ __ ] added in the boston i'm just like [ __ ] yeah dude off to. the races dude and i just think about like i wanted. oh [ __ ] dude i gotta catch ah [ __ ] man gotta catch me i gotta realize i got a great life see i have a great. life i've got a beautiful. son a beautiful beautiful girl. whom i love very much. we hold each other we talk me and kristen we talk. we have good times we laugh. you know we make fun. of each other in beautiful. ways we get in very minimal arguments right. and you know we do kisses. we do all sorts of stuff. but it's you know and then my son it's beautiful. he comes up to me. and he you know i put pomade in his hair. the other day for the first time. i put his hair back like he was a [ __ ] ceo it's awesome. dude i put his hair back and he didn't was like no no. no no and i kept doing it. i kept doing it until he was finally. fine with it i looked in the mirror. and he looked like a ceo. he's boss baby he looked. like a ceo so i'm like it. looks like when he talks. alec baldwin's voice is going. to come out so i saw dr. death by the way i saw that. show from joshua joshua jackson is. in it dude there's definitely two. levels of acting there's three levels. of acting and that's it. there's bad acting there's fine. acting and then there's [ __ ] crazy good acting three levels. bad fine crazy good and like i watched. this [ __ ] dr death show and joshua jackson is fine. and i no hate dude. he's a handsome dude. he was in dawson's creek and you know. i know my exgirlfriend thinks he's very. sexy and that's fine. dude and he was in that show. the affair apparently the show the affair. was good my exgirlfriend liked. it a lot fine. dude she liked it a lot. said he was sexy fine. doesn't really bother. me because i find that. he is kind of whatever. it's not up to. me she likes who she likes and she said. that when we were dating. and that's whatever it's fine. and she likes joshua. jackson she thinks he's sexy. and that's fine she also said the other guy. in the affair was very sexy. and that's fine so now i'm like well. maybe she just likes affairs which doesn't make much. sense why she got so mad. at me when i had one now. oops right now oops. but also maybe that's why she thinks i'm sexy. right because i was a bad. boy reformed but bad boy and um you know. she she liked um joshua jackson in. that and so i took a peek at the doctor death. dude took a peek at the doctor death. and i did it because i saw it. on a billboard and it was on. peacock and i like peacock so sue me. i like peacock peacock. hbo max those are the two. hot shits right now dude. all right i like peacock. i didn't know peacock. peacock there's peacock and there's nbc i had no idea there's a nbc app and peacock. what's the difference i don't. know but on peacock they all say [ __ ] stuff a lot like doctor that they were saying [ __ ] and [ __ ] and they had like you know joshua jackson's a fine actor now sorry but christian slater's a bad actor he shows up and he's talking and he's just he's not good and there's some good acting there's some bad acting him but then alec baldwin shows up and there's a guy who's crazy good dude and he's crazy good in doctor death and it's a fun watch but this is about this christopher dunch dude that was just a lunatic man christopher dunch and yes i i heard the podcast dr death and i've seen the show doctor death and i even saw the [ __ ] documentary mini series that they did on nbc which they left out a lot of that [ __ ] i didn't know he was toting a gun around and [ __ ] the guy was but by the way if you're a surgeon. and you're not doing coke. you're not at that [ __ ] level where you're operating where you should be if you're a true. surgeon you got to. do coke when you're on your day. off you have to. do you got to. be like scarface sitting there just looking around. thinking about an empire dude. you and let me tell you something. nobody does more coke. than a [ __ ] surgeon and i and i won't hear anything other than that i won't hear anything. other than that all doctors they do. mountains of coke dude. especially young ones and if you're in your if you're dude. if you're it peaks. it's like a young doctor young hot. shot doctor you're getting [ __ ] you're you know. 30 35 year old wow dude. lots of coke you get to. do 40 years old lots of coke. and then you have a family. right you do a little bit less. coast but you still do it. and then it becomes like you know. 45 50s every night. and then you have everything. and then 60 and then you go down. but you do mountains. of coke if you put on a lab. coat mountains of coke. and uh maybe not if you're like a pediatrician but like wow. that would be hilarious. so what we got you. want lollipops what you got you. want a lollipop [music]. look you cringe at the pump. don't you the gas prices are. high you get an eyepopping check at. your favorite restaurant you. get it

as a surgeon. though for real what do you do. i make sure people [ __ ] live i save lives a lot a lot a lot of uh surges probably think they're a little bit jesus. christ you know but this guy thought he was god man. and he would go in and he would [ __ ] he would convince people to. get surgeries even if they didn't need. to and then he would just paralyze them. it was the war and some people. died the weirdest serial killer. ever if you're this is the thing. about christopher dunch why he's a [ __ ] coldhearted [ __ ] because dude if you're gonna serial killer if you're gonna be a serial
