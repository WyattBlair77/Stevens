like you know. you got it sometimes see the [ __ ] striations and you got is sometimes see the [ __ ] [ __ ] dude if you don't see the cuts what we're doing it for now i'm not doing it i'm not the kind of guy that's like yeah i [ __ ] work out i do work out for me but a lot of people are like i work out for me you know and you know like no you don't then why do you have lip injections why do you have [ __ ] a fake butt but for guys we don't get fake butts and normally we don't get lip injections but there are a few guys at my gym who do have lip injections now that it's very weird. to me but it's all. good there was this guy. at the gym the other day. that was so i was watching the guy. this guy work out like in a noncreepy way. you know but i was watching him. work out and i was like i was like uh yeah. he's working out his only his leg. and his his legs. and his trunk and he was [ __ ] doing like steps. up on the thing holding. the big bar and [ __ ] lunging up and then only lunges and then working out his ass and he was doing it hard. and i was like dude. that guy's [ __ ] rad he was killing. it and he was doing it. he was like mmm he wouldn't say the full. number he would just be like and when you got the seven. year ago a like come on dude. just say the whole number. if you're gonna do two syllables. with it you know and and it was like damn. dude why is he only working. out his [ __ ] legs and trunk and then when he would walk away from the the weights he had the most [ __ ] sachet a smooth movement. and i was like oh he's gay. that's why cuz gay guy i didn't. realize that gay guys probably. work out their [ __ ] trunk. and legs like ladies dude because it's all about that. what do you call. it the aesthetics you know. it's all about the extent. aesthetics now i'm a guy. and personally moon tracked it to. girls and so it doesn't really. matter what you look like as a guy. which is kind of weird. you gotta look a little bit. presentable you got to. have some cuts and some striations. maybe but it's okay. if you have a little bit of a dad. bod because girls love [ __ ] leonardo. dicaprio and i don't ever really know. him to be [ __ ] finish it maybe it's because he's rich. as [ __ ] and real talented. and not because of his body right. i don't know all i know is i've never sent. a dick pic in my life. in my whole life i've never sent. a dick pic never once. sent a dick pic. in my life at one. time i heard an actress was. bragging that i sent her a dick. pic and if somebody said to. me hey man you sent a girl. dick pic she said you were sending dick. pics and [ __ ] like with each other you were sexting and and sending like tits and dick pics and [ __ ] she sent me and i was like dude i don't even know that. girl dude the amount of [ __ ] i hear about about me. is are is so insane. i'm like what who is. that even though it was. had to look her. up and i mean she was hot. and stuff but i was like darn never even. met her in my life. i was like are you sure. she was talking about me. he said yeah man. you just saying you is it. the comedian and say yeah i was like all right. i was like there's another chris d'elia. that has a [ __ ] something to. do with the university over in dc. or something and he's 57. you [ __ ] was at him. like nope anyway that's what's up. dude lots of lies. out there you know i mean. that's a lion tamarin if a girl ever asked. me for a dick pic. i'd be like nah but i'll draw it. i'll draw it to. size and i would secretly draw it a little bit more. veiny just so when she saw it eventually. she'd be like oh okay it's not as vain. as i thought it was ah if you're watching the [ __ ] by the way the new renovations has been going great. man we got a lot. of hits on the youtube. shits and we got a new [ __ ] design up here we don't have. a new design but we have a new. thing that we hung up. and it's a [ __ ] cuda to. remind you [ __ ] where you came from. dude we got a coo to. hang it up on the right. side of my head. and it's probably a left. side for you if you're looking. right yeah yeah it would be the left. side so it's on the right. side of my head. before you [ __ ] bitchass trolls. or like oh it's on the left. side no it's not. dude no it's not it's actually. on the right side. because i if you think about sitting in this chair. now we [ __ ] got you dude didn't we you thought it was the left side. but it's the right side. dude it's the [ __ ] right side dude this the right side the coudé is on the right. side dude and this is to. remind you [ __ ] where you came from. dude this is how it is full. circle there's a cuda on. the right and we got the congratulations. [ __ ] cult sign right. here by some girl named katherine i think it's on the back. of it then she put her name and i didn't [ __ ] look this past. week even though i said i would so i could shout her. out but i think her name's katherine and dude. this is it full circle. imagine a full circle going. out like that a full circle where we got the cuda. on the right and then all the way over to. the left you see the [ __ ] [ __ ] you see the other side of it but it's a full circle man. and we're all up there. or down here and i'll tell you what. dude this shirts too goddamn. small and i'll tell you what even. more it's too hot in here. and it's a grey shirt. and it's gonna show my [ __ ] beads of sweat dripping down my [ __ ] black diamond it's gonna show. it under the [ __ ] armpits i don't know man. uh what i do know. is i've been [ __ ] every time you know i follow worldstar after they posted. my a minim video i was like oh that's cool. i started following him and worldstar first. of all worldstar posts 900. times a day which is fine. because i guess they want it. they want the content these people are followed they got 20. million followers but also besides that dude. i post on every time. they post so much. about takashi 69 that. guy and every time i everytime i they post. about takashi 69 i [ __ ] say man. i talk about i say man. that i always write man. that chick is beautiful i always write. like god she's really looking good. lately like she took she took her like every i'll bite i i write like oh man. she because she got she got her. teeth out she got a rainbow. teeth out and i was like oh man. she looks good still but i gotta say. she looks good both ways. but she looks really sexy. with the like the rainbow. look you know and and dude. the people who [ __ ] light me up. in the comments is hilarious. first of all for some reason. this is the number one. comment i get exactly this. you gay just the you and then gay which is and then some people are like dude. my man that's a guy. not a girl oh yeah dude. oh yeah he had a shirt. off his shirt off at the concert. and they were posting a video of his shirt. off at the concert and i was like man. it's so it's so crazy. that she's i forget what put some like oh she's so crazy. she's performing shirtless and and people just under. that you gay you gay. this world is just amazing. you to see that comment. and then to write you gay. like they're alerting me to. something first of all not knowing that. i'm making a joke second. of all not knowing not thinking like wow. this guy thinks a girl would just perform. shirtless anyway she's a [ __ ] beautiful girl takashi six nine is a beautiful girl like straight up i'll tell you what man that girl's sex he's got long beautiful rainbow hair and she's got long a really great grill she's got a really great sex appeal. too and she's got 69. all over her body so you know. she's down dude you know. she's down to put her [ __ ] and face burger. you know where you're you know. is and you know she's down. i bet she's a good dancer. but i will say though. it's hilarious to. get those you gay. comments what the [ __ ] i just people on the internet are insane. and we know this and that's not a premise. that is new but we know. that but anyway you gay. um i was i ran off i ran. four miles the other day. all right now that's cool. now every time i sometimes. i post that on instagram. on my story and i'll just put like how many like my like miles i ran or like calories. i burned or whatever. and i'll post that on my story and then first of all people will. be like all men you talk. [ __ ] about this in your last special which is so wrong and i didn't all i did when i was making fun of other people who are super inspirational. on on on instagram and me posting a picture of that. is not that but people love. to [ __ ] be like do all the park. all in the google block. you know anyway i did that and then i was like so i run. i can run like a [ __ ] it like straight shot like i can keep that under nine minutes. under a 9minute mile. if i'm doing [ __ ] four miles right and then i was like how what can i do how can i run like what's the fastest. i could run a mile. and i it's around eight. minutes like i do an eight i can do. an eight minute mile. okay and then i was like what's the fastest. mile ever ran and it's recorded and it's three minutes. and 43 seconds okay. so i was like how fast is that like when you're doing. it you know cuz when you watch the guy. do it you're like okay. these guys are probably who knows how tall they are. but they're so lanky and it just looks like they're just jogging right. so i was like i was like i looked it. up and then i [ __ ] tried to. hit it on the treadmill hey man. i can't even get to. that fast dude these guys. can do it for a mile. i can't even top speed. it there i can go people. are like that there was a there. was a thing on it. was like i was like what is like a really good fast. mile that you can try and do and it's like a fiveminute. mile that's [ __ ] too fast you're sprinting the whole time and i got news. for you i'm not kenyan i'm a [ __ ] white guy from new jersey that's so fast. a fiveminute mile and i was like i was like what kind of mile. like what kind of fast. like how fast is that. and i did it and by the way. when i run when i do my four. miles i do sprints and then i slow. it down and then i do a sprint and then i slow. it down by the end of the fourth mile. my back and my abs. were like a hug guy okay we got to. stop mile it's not your legs. dude my legs could keep going i when i was done. i was like dude good thing i stopped my back. would it gave the [ __ ] out dude. three minutes and 43. seconds that's insane by the way. if i started running like we know. humans can run for miles and miles or for you. know for miles if i was the first human. and i ran for miles i will be like hey everybody. just so you know that's as much. as you can run. as a human you it's bad. for the body if you go any longer than that. and everyone will be like okay. so all i'm saying is good. thing i'm not the [ __ ] first human. man i would have [ __ ] we would have been a bunch of fat lazy pieces of [ __ ] i'd have been like hey four miles that's a top speed five minute mile. you can go about you know. that's it any faster. than that your knees. blow open and your back gives out. and you die you die. if you go faster than that. and kenyans would be like what are you. talking about it we would. have met a bunch of kenyans anyway but i would [ __ ] you're talking about and be like yeah yo you guys got to. die early and then they just keep running. and they never stop but that's [ __ ] i've been doing that. but going on these hikes to. to try and [ __ ] split it up. you know and not just do these not. just do the running. because you know you got a [ __ ] ya know stay healthy a bunch. of different ways and also if you work. out other muscles then you get going in the running will be easier and i do hikes and i dude it is there is this [ __ ] trail we do that's just so hard and i know sometimes i do this the runyon trail and people are like nice dude la oh dude it's hard i don't give a [ __ ] when you say it's not hard you're doing one of those [ __ ] things that people do or it's like you're just saying [ __ ] or you're like just saying [ __ ] to. sound cool we're like oh pineapple doesn't belong. our pizza or [ __ ] you know it's so hard it's hard and it and and i did it and this is how hard it is as a matter of fact one last time not last time but one of the other hikes i did recently i [ __ ] woke up real nice good or early for me. it was about you know 9:45 a.m. that's real nice and early for me. just when the suns peeking out over. the horizon 9:45 a.m. and i and i got up. i didn't take a shower. because i was gonna sweat my balls. off doing a hike. and it was hot. as [ __ ] put on my shirt put on my pants. put on my [ __ ] gear. that i got from by the way. let me give this company a shoutout. it makes great workout gear. um a srv a a srv. is that what it is. a srv yep they make the [ __ ] best [ __ ] i got my workout gear on from a srv i put my a srv shorts on my asr va srv shirt on and i went and i went on and i went down to. the [ __ ] coffee bean. i got if i got a nice black tumeric the ice. black americano sucked that. down didn't put anything in my belly. and and i went on the hike. and it was tough and i almost had to. use my hands that's how hard the hike. is okay and when i i was with my buddy. dan and what my buddy. marc and i almost got to. the top and when i almost got to. the top my tummy. went over and i thought huh. that's interesting didn't need anything just suck. down some coffee oh by the way. i already went number two before. the hike in my bathroom. at home okay as i'm running. up almost to the top. i say to. dan and marc hey man. it's a good thing i went. number two already because when i get up. to the because because if i didn't i would have for sure. had to go on this. hike tummy responds by going. wrong or or again okay. get all the way up to. the top of the hat. oh i went also with my buddy. kevin durant not kevin durant the basketball. player the actor that's [ __ ] really good oh no dan. wasn't there was kevin and mark anyway. it doesn't matter he's up. my buddy kevin's on the the the the strain and so get all the way. to the top my stomach is. going but a lot of rural or rural. or or and i'm like oh what the [ __ ] dude. i know i don't have to. go number two because i just went so then we start. to go downhill and i say ah you guys guess. what think i got a [ __ ] go number two here. on this hike on. the way down and kevin's like really and mark's like are. you sure oh seriously cuz he always says that. because he's irish and that's all he says oh seriously and i walk. down a few more. steps and i said look. guys there's no stopping this. there's no way there was no. private area so i pulled down. my pants and i went a number two right. on that hike and felt great. immediately afterwards it was probably like a foursecond. it all just came out when and then i took my asr v shirt. and that had to. be how i cleaned up. so a srv i really loved that shirt. i wish i [ __ ] still had it but i don't and then guess what when hiking again. the next day sure it was still there. there's nothing i can do. about that and i'm sorry. and i'm sorry for everyone that. runs by and sees a [ __ ] shitty is rv shirt but what am i gonna do dude that's nature. baby that's [ __ ] that's me. that's humans in their natural. habitat my babies that's it. that's how you remember that. that hike by the way. i haven't talked kevin that was our oh we got a catchup. hike i hadn't [ __ ] seen him in in [ __ ] years okay let's catch up cool you wanted to. run in yeah i'm gonna be in [ __ ] la cool cool let's hike. up the hill oh. cool no excuse me one. second let me just let me. take my shirt off and just there we go. let me grab one end. and [ __ ] with one fist in front of my balls. one end with one fist and behind my balls. light and clean my taint like a [ __ ] like a like a jock portrayed in the 1980. show oh so anyway our cool. that was cool you're on the stream for three. years and were able to. buy a house because of it. and [ __ ] white wiped wiped i cleaned up. with my [ __ ] free eye a srv shirt. so by the way i have a bunch of a srv clothing. still and i'm gonna wear that i love. that [ __ ] company and thank you for helping me to. because you helped me. and thank god i was wearing a black shirt. too not a white. one because then you know anyway if you're a tourist in la. and you're a [ __ ] fan of mine go [ __ ] snap a photo. of that it's probably not there. anymore what a [ __ ] awful awful. i felt good afterwards. i was like you know what i'm close. to nature this is how it is and i [ __ ] and then when we said bye it. was like see i was like bryce didn't touch. it but we should get out. you know see you later. then drove home and took a [ __ ] great shower. and that's my story oh it's [ __ ] that was the only time i ever did that. by the way outside ever there's the only time. i ever went number two outside. and that's weird we should all we should all do that everyone. should have to. do that you know my buddy. kevin

told him. the story and he was like that's what i don't. know if he was joking. or not i feel like you wasn't because this is something. you would do it's like that's why. i always wear cargo shorts. when i [ __ ] hike and i also bring a knife. so if i ever have to. run into that problem. i just cut off one. of the pockets and wipe my ass. that way i was like who are you. [ __ ] dump macgyver hey who are you [ __ ] bowel movement. macgyver brings a knife. hey dude i'm gonna bring a knife. on the hike how. come case i need to.

[ __ ] kills me dude. i don't know why i think that's so funny. but it is because it's probably cuz it's make it seems like it's making fun. of things like that dog. goes to me seems like that language. is making fun of internet. talk you know i'm saying it. seems like it's less serious. than somebody being like you know. some other kind of [ __ ] fml or whatever. even though whatever fml isn't so bad. what is your favorite. memory at the comedy. store jordan at jordans vegan that's a good question. wow i have a lot i have a lot. i have a i have a lot. okay my i think i've told this. on the podcast before but if not i'll do it. again i have two that come. to mind one is i was at the laugh. factory one night i know that's not the comedy. show but this other story starts. and i was doing crowd work. with a bunch of guys who happened. to be from saskatchewan canada. and i was making fun of them. and this is what i was coming. up right this is not when i was on tv. and [ __ ] like that i think i had been in some i've been in some some stuff but they were there they didn't know who i was and i was clowning on. him and they were laughing. and everyone was we were having a good. time in the audience whatever okay. then the next night i went to. the comedy store and it was late. at night i was still doing those. latenight spots there were about you know maybe 20. people there and i said it's way. really dark at the comedy store. that those of you that never been the laughs. actors like this really bright. hi how you do in place. and this comedy store is this. the comedy store is is dark. you know dungeness kind of place. that's [ __ ] awesome okay so it feels like kind of dangerous. in a way you know. like a strip club and some like that so i start. doing crowd work because it's late at night. and it's and you know. material isn't really working because it's late at night and people have been there for hours. so i start doing crowd work to. people i start doing crowd work. to these guys and i'm making fun. of them and they're laughing. and we're all laughing and then i say you know. this this goes on for minutes. and then i say where the [ __ ] you guys from and they say saskatchewan i said really that's so [ __ ] weird last night. there were these guys from saskatchewan that. i was clowning and and you guys. are from saskatchewan and they say yeah. we were those guys and so now i start. laughing i was like why the [ __ ] are you hearing. it did you not know. i was gonna be here and they were like no we knew we liked. you so he came back again. and so that felt really good and then also so i was like well. [ __ ] it i'm just gonna do all the [ __ ] that i did about two scotch one last night i started doing the same quoteunquote crowd work to. them and they were in on the joke. but nobody else was but they were laughing. because it was still like the first time. they heard these jokes. about them and so i was doing like the same. thing that i did the night. before with them versus to. them which i did the first. night and i start i was laughing. so hard because of it. and that i think i was laughing. so but just it just it. made me realize how special like standup. comedy could be and how cool it. was because it was not a thing. that was going to. happen again in my lifetime. or my career because it was just to. by chance and now it's certainly not gonna happen. because people you know that. kind of my show they're gonna know. who i am but they discovered that. night at the laughs factor and then came the next. night at the comedy. store and then the fact that we just redid. this [ __ ] again for the audience. there was just really fun. and cool and special and i always think of that. those guys made my life [ __ ] better. in a way and then there was another night. that i will never forget. i'll never forget there was so many. nights i'll never forget. the comedy store by the way. so these are just two that. kind of mind brody stephens. who as a comedian is one. of my favorite comedians if you don't know. his stuff you got a look. at him furthermore if you're in la. you have to. go see him he's a really great. live but he's also great. just if you look up. clips brody stephens is his name stephen brody stephens for some [ __ ] reason he's got two stephens in his name and he's this comedian that goes on stage and he really like he'll do jokes but then in the middle he'll be like you know i've worked for this spot i park for free and [ __ ] like that he's just hilarious and silly i'm one time on new year's the new year's crowds are always weird and he was going on and he was gonna be the guy who went on at the at the comedy store when the ball dropped he was gonna bring in the new year. and he was like and the crowd. wasn't really receptive to. him and he said you guys have to. laugh i'll ruin your new year's. just like this kind of guy. he's really funny anyway. the comedy store spots. are 15 minutes each so. he went on and he at this. time he was going on. a light like he would go on at like [ __ ] it was like probably twelve. fifteen or something so he was going. on and there were about 12. people in the audience okay and he went on. and he was bombing. because there were 12. people in the audience and he was just being weird. or whatever by the end. of the 15 minutes he was. there had more people came into. the showroom like people wanted to. come in from outside. and just be like ah the comedy. store let's catch a show. he started doing really well. but this guy came in in the middle. of the act and was drunk. and brody started making fun of him. and he started killing he. started murdering right and now there were like 35. people there and now all the comedian's were watching. and brody really started. murdering and in my head i was like this. is one of the best. that's i've ever seen far. okay so it came time. for brody to bring up. the next comedian who was rusty. dooley i don't know if you know who he is. and rusty was there but brody was killing. so hard that when brody was like that's my time. everyone was like no no. no stay so rusty. from the back of the room. was like look just you know. what you're killing just [ __ ]. do my spot too there's no reason. for me to come up. there everyone loves you why. not [ __ ] have your have another set. do another 15 minutes [ __ ] it so everyone was like yeah do it do it and brody is like only if it's okay with you rusty and rushes like yeah as long as i get paid my [ __ ] $15 i don't give a [ __ ] and brody's like all right [ __ ] it i'll do another set and everyone's like yeah so brody starts doing this next set now rusty dooley said now he's on stage for 15 more minutes thirty minutes he starts more people come in the room because of this you know people like hey he's doing he's doing rusty set now rusty gibbon time really yeah he's killing. when don says so now the room. is getting full it's like half. full and brody is bob. now because there's more people in it. he is lighting this place. up it is the whole. room is completely turned around. and he's killing even. harder and i'm thinking this. is even the better set. that i just seen right. so he's murdering so now thirty. seconds goes by now this guy he's built a rapport. with this drunk guy he's still there. the guys becoming kind of part. of the set other people are
