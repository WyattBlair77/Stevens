 so i was in this. mood thinking about this like [ __ ] [ __ ] where i was like all cool like futuristic. stuff and all that and deep [ __ ] and like all you know you know scifi deep [ __ ] but then i got off the plane and my opener who sits all the way in the back cuz he sits coach. [ __ ] cuz that's what he deserves you know. i make him do it. and he was like hey man. i saw jumanji and i was like ah oh yeah he said yeah it's [ __ ] funny that's a guy yeah he said yeah kevin hartz funny and the rocks really good at doing those movies i was just a great. he's a great movie star. huh and i was like yeah. dude you know and i'm still thinking i'm. still in my [ __ ] dystopian universe. [ __ ] talking i think about like you know robots and how we can connect with you know how machines will take over humans and this guy's up here talking about how oh yeah it's cool. because the rock was you know they enter this video game. and the rock was like this. little bitchass and kevin hart. was like the strong one. and then they had to. reverse roles and the girl was a guy and jack black was a girl. and now he's jack black and this. and that and he's into. and he kept all those bigass. rhinos and i'm like hey dude you got to. slow the [ __ ] down you know when two people are in two different moods and they just don't meet and you just can't do it and you're like and i was getting pissed off. for no reason but this guy's talking to. me about jumanji for way. too long during the whole walk. to baggage claim he's talking to. me about jumanji and how good it. is now here's the other thing. i might watch jumanji. and i think kevin hart. is great and i think the rock. is great i love jack black. and that other girl looks like she's funny. but like at this moment. in time i'm thinking about robots. taking over the world and this. guy's trying to. talk to me about how good jumanji. was and i'm like and i'm like bro. you got to stop i said you got to. stop talking about jumanji but then i realized i've done. that and it's just about moods. that don't they're like two. ships passing each other in the night. man right like have you ever [ __ ] been in a bad mood and then somebody who drank a cup of coffee. walked around you just wanna. punch him in the [ __ ] face but then sometimes that's you so i learned. something as i do that. you just gonna let people have the moods that they get in you know. you just got a [ __ ] chill let the people have the moods that they get in and you got to. you got to kind of stick. why cuz here's the thing. my opener does that [ __ ] to. me too like sometimes. i'll be like man. how come i get so upset. when this happens and i'll be like i don't know. bro chill how long we have to. talk about this i don't want to. [ __ ] fire him every time i don't know it's like a wavelength though i know i talk about this. but i was thinking about this. too in comedy. like all these instagram [ __ ] videos or that. the people cut together and make and think are funny is like when your ex. walks in and your girl's. got a bubble butt. and like all those stupidest. [ __ ] [ __ ] videos every single one that's just zero funny it's like [ __ ] it's so bad and then they go slowmotion and it's always the [ __ ] it'll cut to. a thing and a closeup of life. and then it's like a cup a bad. bad bad i got the bad. bad bad and some girl would be shaking her. butt and then and it's so bad. and everybody's so like washed. out and the eye lines. are all wrong you know. but like those people are doing what they see. what they think like here's the thing. if you're funny you're on a wavelength. that funny people are on right. like here's a guy who's really good at it. uh what's that guy's name. i always forget his name. on portlandia fred armisen that. guy's just funny he's on that. wavelength some of my buddies. are that way bryan callen. andrew santino these guys are just on that. wavelength bobby lee they're just funny. they get it they're on that. wavelength now that transcends you can be funny. it's weird because like funny is like a language. but in a wavelength but you can be funny. to people who aren't on that. wavelength now some people want. aren't on that wavelength. don't get it but some people who aren't on that. wavelength you can break through. that wavelength and reach them. and they think it's funny. because you're showing them. what's funny it's like it's like it's like it's like it's like a chef. brings out [ __ ] clams and like i don't like clams is like well these i made him a certain way and like okay and you taste me like ah i do like it i didn't think i would but i do that person showed you what it's like right. but since that happened since we can we i say. we like i'm on the wavelength. saqqaq but like since a funny person if they're on that. wavelength and they break through. to somebody who's not funny and they think that that's funny. then they see what that. is that person who is not on. that wavelength will be like oh that's what's funny. and so then instagram they have an instagram and they'll be like oh i'm gonna make funny. videos i'm gonna do all the things. that funny people do and then that will be funny. but that's not what's funny what's funny. is that wavelength that they are. not on and so these videos that come. out that are for the lowest common. denominator which is like when your girl. has a bubble butt and she gives you some cash wink gun gun. i got the bad bad back. i got the bad bad bad. that is not on that. wavelength but it's for all. the other people not on that. wavelength that don't get that wavelength. it's for people that walk around. in the funny you in the universe. that just aren't on that wavelength. that are literally like this. when it comes to. humor i shed it that's. how they are though. they might be a great. businessman or banker or a [ __ ] great. in fashion or whatever. the [ __ ] even creatively they could be a good painter but when it comes to. humor i leaked out. some [ __ ] a leaking out. [ __ ] that's how smart. they are they're not on that. wavelength but the lowest common. denominator is the most they're the most people so those videos on instagram. become [ __ ] popular as [ __ ] and then those people get 20 million followers i'm coming up i want the world to. know i did a 30. sugar is leaking that's the truth. dude because they think they are all those people not on that. wave like they think bill. burr is funny they get it they think they get it they think some of them think he's four they think that you know uh the other guys i mentioned bryan callen it's funny. you see andrew santino and these [ __ ] you know but they're not on that wavelength. they're tasting the clams from the chef. that prepared them the way. that they didn't think that. they'd like them and it turns. out that they like them. and that's the realest [ __ ] i ever said man. that's the religion it's the realest reliable. rope
