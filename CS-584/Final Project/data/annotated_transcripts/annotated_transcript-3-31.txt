[ __ ] start fighting more doctors and [ __ ] or just kind of like cut ties with companies that don't even [ __ ] exist that i [ __ ] don't even have a thing with whatever i don't know what i'm saying but i do know is unfucking i went to. i went to. my show at the improv. this past week and uh i was there. and i got a [ __ ] you know on my keys. i have the air tag [ __ ] like to. always if i need to. know where my keys. are i can't find my keys. and also my wife loses. [ __ ] a lot so like i'll just i'll tap. it and it'll really look beep. beep beep beep. beep beep i'm like oh. i go find the air. attack where is it oh. for some reason it's under a book. like nobody in this house has read. a book and i [ __ ] nine years. and she's just it's in the middle. of a [ __ ] book about mental. health or some [ __ ] and um and so i get the key. with the air tag you know. and then i go and i drive so i got him. on all my keys. i got them on the [ __ ] keys. i got keys for days. i got them on my keys. right you know i got [ __ ] all the sets of keys. um david sullivan as you. know he's one of my friends. i talk about him. a bit on the podcast. he's like hey man. what are we doing tonight so i'm like all. right let's go i gotta show. at the improv be here at 9. 30. he says ah man. i'll be there you want. me coming not 20. and i was like just no i got therapy. until until nine show up at [ __ ] you know show up at 9 15 how about he's like i'll be there man so um shows up he's like do i get to. see calvin calvin's a night owl. right so he's out. he's up my sometimes the comment says. up till 11. no lie you know. whatever works with my schedule. that's what the pediatrician says and that. works with my schedule so if you're mad. at me for being a bad. parent be mad at my pediatrician um and so and so he's like uh shows. up sees calvin calvin's. walking around like a robot. hey you're a robot huh. so he's like all right. let's go so we go. now i don't know if you know this about air. tags but it's actually a cool feature. okay if you're around. an air tag for about. 20 minutes an air tag will. let you know okay meaning if it's not your air. tech so if you were in a backpack. and someone takes an air attack. from apple and tosses it. into that little compartment on the side. that nobody uses except for [ __ ] tic tacs but who you know. what i mean uh uh and it's on you for more. than 20 minutes your phone. will go off and let you know. there's an air tag. near you and then this way you know somebody's either tracking you or whatever the [ __ ] right and i think that that's a great feature all right now everyone if you look at your phone and what it literally says is an air tag uh an unknown air tag is near you click to. disable okay that's all you gotta that's all you look at that. and you think oh okay. and now if you're alone. in the woods a hundred percent. you click disable if you're at the mall. alone you're a hundred percent. click disable okay if you're somewhere where you shouldn't be. you 100 click disable okay. now if you're chilling. with your friends what do you think you do. ignore it because anyone can get apple air. tags and you think you know. what this is probably bob's air. tag so you ignore. it okay now how shabby do you have. to be to know to. ignore that or to. see the thing on the phone. and think you know what it's probably. [ __ ] it's kristen's or bob's or [ __ ] jared's or whatever the [ __ ] right not that savvy right if you're 74 and my mom she might be like chris from the other room chris what what is this oh it's fine just [ __ ] it's dad's you know it's to. dad's [ __ ] it's to. the dog or whatever. don't worry okay right. i'm 42 and i know it's hard. to believe because i look [ __ ] young and we know that's a joke. because i looked at myself. on the zoom camera the other day. no it was today uh for when i was in my therapy. and i looked absolutely 49. and it's all good if i look for none. it's all good but it's the truth. that's all good um how do i how do i look. forget it's all good okay. and it's all good now. do i wish that i had [ __ ] salt and pepper also in my hair here because i don't like the way it looks especially yes it's all good yes it's fine dude am i aging the way i should be aging yes and do people on their internet say whoa he got old and okay yes because i'm [ __ ] 42 and nobody says i'm forever and that's okay it's all good dessert my feelings no it's fine but every now and then i look at myself in the zoom camera it's bad lighting and yes i look bad and i feel bad okay but that's neither here nor there no so if you're in your 40s. you're pretty savvy with the online. shits you're pretty savvy with the apps. you're pretty savvy with apple products. if you have them be savvy you should be savvy especially if you're what. in a big metropolitan area. like los angeles you should be somewhat. savvy so we're going to. the improv and now how are we getting there. my car and what do we use to. start a car keys. and what's on my keys. everyone stay with me. air tags i take the stage at the improv. two minutes in now i'm in the middle. of high hilarity okay it. breaks my [ __ ] up i don't know what it is i look at my phone why is my phone doing this phone's not doing [ __ ] i'm clueless because i'm in the middle of a high octane thing right and i say did you guys hear that or was it me am i losing my mind then i decide to. let it go i get off. stage now obviously [ __ ] crush city. population 210 people in there. and uh i get off stage. and david's looking at me. like this does your phone. make that noise and i was like yeah. what and he was like my phone. made to know the same. time your phone made the noise. i said what are you. talking about he's like yeah. is there an air. attack following you and i'm like hey man. what and he said sums. up my phone man and i was like what. are you talking about he says it. set on my phone. that somebody's trying to.

[ __ ] it and just flies away ends. yeah right and so uh yeah like disney. gives a [ __ ] so there so arielle is black now. and um i could give a rat's. ass but people are mad. because they think like you know. they're [ __ ] up history literally you know i assume a lot. of these people are white. uh because arielle was drawn originally. white which also has no legs so she's not real. she's got a fin instead of legs. so anyway pipe down but i don't give a [ __ ] is it is it is it. annoying the reason yes the reason. why it's annoying is because you know. disney doesn't give a [ __ ] about it but they're doing it because they think that affects it affects their bottom line. and so here's the deal. so they made her black which fine. i give a [ __ ] like i said but now people are mad. at that and and woke quote unquote. people are mad that they photoshopped the black girl and she doesn't seem as black so they lose. again my point is you can't. ever be woke enough this. movement makes people uh they eat their own. so you can't win so just from now. on every disney character. white it doesn't matter. what the [ __ ] white and i'm talking about like the cricket. in pinocchio now he's white. okay the trolls they're all. white i know they were pink. and blue and [ __ ] [ __ ] white dude this way you don't get to. be mad if oh well that one. is obviously the black one. because of the way it. talks and he has a backwards hat. on or jar jar binks. he is white you know. me so privileged and so but i just think it's [ __ ] you just can't win dude. so just like who you know. this whole world [ __ ] i don't give a [ __ ] what it doesn't matter what am. i i'm the old guy. now or whatever ariel's black. i think that she should be black i think that everyone. in that movie should be black and i think that it. should be literally the blackest movie i've ever [ __ ] seen i don't know. i should change ever since. the [ __ ] queen died you know it's actually crazy that she died and was alive for so long and they first of all like you britain let's hurry up with the funeral you know what i mean like they [ __ ] it was like what did they [ __ ] wait nine weeks dude they she died and then she they had to. like pass her body. around or whatever the [ __ ] play hot potato. with it you know like just like they propped her. up and took some pictures with her. and [ __ ] they did taxidermy on her [ __ ] face it's like so it's like dude the traditions. are so annoying there's a [ __ ] actual in italy. there's an actual channel on italian. tv devoted to like one. of the old [ __ ] popes or some [ __ ] and he's been dead. for years decades and he's just sitting there. and it's a live feed. you know it is on tv. it's not like a twitch channel. and uh like dude how about this man. like to be think about like how annoying. everybody is to. not be able to. be left alone dead i know you'd have no feeling. about it either way. but like the disrespect the utter that. is the most italian thing. of all time well he dies. but we cannot put up. a live stream about it. but don't you think it's disrespectful. it doesn't matter he doesn't have. we need to spare a respects. it's for the people so there's a live feed. of it and uh you can do that. and so now it's like the queen is just finally been buried. or whatever the [ __ ] had her i don't know what she was but they had her uh what do you call. it funeral so that's great. good job good job brits. uh well i think we should bury about an hour. like a weekend ah well it's quite a few days you never know. cousin could show up and want. to see her you know. closure whatever we need to. try some other crowns on her. too before we pick. the right one the burial in uh what to. say she's getting kind of uh you know. it's just a bit uh it's musty. i'll say in a room underground. or what um i can't. believe like the the line. of waiting to see a dead. person is 12 hours or no. it's something the people waited. for a day like 24 hours. dude to think that like sometimes. like to get people in the in the sh. in my show it takes like an hour. to get everybody seated like the fact that i don't have as much. people aren't ex don't have the same amount of excitement to. see me than they do. a dead lady you know just 20. like i ain't [ __ ] because people will wait 24. times as long to. see a dead chick so [ __ ] disrespectful to. call the queen that but the truth. is a dead lady then to. see like my hard work so i ain't. [ __ ] dude um but david beckham was there and he waited or something no he waited imagine how about that dude if they made dev david beckham wait 12 hours jesus dude i would have had to. wait [ __ ] they would have made me wait extra i'd be like i'm next and i'd be like oh just hold on david beckham's 12hour wait. to pay his respects. how the queen ended in an emotional moment. although it would have [ __ ] made me wait i'd still be waiting she'd be buried. and be like nah we'll be right. with you well did didn't you no. hold on you were canceled. all around the world people have been mourning the loss. to the queen elizabeth ii who passed away. at the age of 96 december. or a cinema um many have been lining. up to pay the respective. on the soccer superstar david beckham wow and still look goddamn ravishing. all 12 hours like just dressed like a [ __ ] just so dapper you know. wow the britons police hats [ __ ] suck you could. keep a whole cake in there. the former footballer was first. spotted in the queue around. 2 a.m 2 a.m jesus i did. not end up making decide okay. until three what the [ __ ] this guy slept out there the [ __ ] david beckham's life you know yeah it doesn't matter i'll just he sounds [ __ ] australian to. me 100 we all want. to be here together. we all want to. experience something we are celebrate an amazing. life of our queen he said wow he waited. 12 hours wow uh the british. icon also explained that he was there. in honor of why. is he dressed like somebody from [ __ ] um peaky blinders dude. that's amazing dude did you guys. see this the [ __ ] lady who made here's something that needs to. stop for real i thought this was a joke. when i first saw it if you're uh 80. or 70 don't make a hiphop. video it hey utah. district listen up right. here there's a new name. on the ballot for the senate this year. i mean you know there's the new name. on it it's so high dude. it sounds crisp as [ __ ] like she did. it in a [ __ ] booth. turn me up in the headphones. cincy wow hey youtube well listen up. there's a new name on the ballot. for the senate this year. my name is linda. paulson republican and also i love. god and family and the constitution. it doesn't rhyme we try to. get another conservative to. rent i mean you know rhymed. awesome with constitution um is that what you did. republican and awesome love i mean. so republican and awesome. in love with god and family. and the constitution family and the constitution. get another conservative worst picture. to use dude so far. away and blurry yeah not even. centered nobody could do it. so i'm getting it done. i'm proreligious freedom prolife pro. police the right to. bear arms and the right. to the only rapper. police government control and regulation. want to stop and expose all political. corruption with integrity morality the government. program should lead to. selfsufficiency and support traditional family. as the fundamental unit. of society i had in schools there. push it for new beliefs and just to. clarify this keep your dick. that's a female adult i know. what a woman is the hell. hitler at the end wow. we gotta watch this. again hey utah district. 12 listen the way she turns. around here so out. of breath after this. you know like had to. sit down and [ __ ] actually put her hand to. her chest name on the ballot. for the senate this year. my name is linda. republican and awesome love god and family. and the constitution i can't she hey you can hear right. lady republican and awesome. i love god and family. and the constant awesome. i tried to get another. conservative to rent nobody could do it. so i'm getting it done. prolife pro police the right to. bear arms and the right. to freeze feet i. want less government control and regulation. want to stop and expose all political. corruption with his integrity morality accountability. government programs should lead to. selfsufficiency wow and support traditional. family as a governmental unit of society. but in schools there pushing. for new beliefs worst shot of. a school just to. clarify this because there's some who can't define. this as a female adult. i know what a woman is. it's a [ __ ] at the end unbelievable dude when she goes like this. just the picture of the [ __ ] lady wanted to. call her black so bad. you know um wow the comment here. surprisingly wholesome somebody says yeah. guy okay no hey somebody who doesn't realize how they're coming. off cannot lead okay. that's a big whoopsie daisy. and of course he's from utah. ah um i saw that movie.

[ __ ] michael caine also not a code of silence. one of the best things. about filling your dinner. sir michael kane you can't be. a [ __ ] in the code. is silence with 19. bajillion instagram followers you know i love how much the rock hates [ __ ] vin diesel too you know it dude you know it they asked him to. come back and they and he said no. and it was because of vin diesel. i think and then that that's [ __ ] um but i did see that movie beast. and that was good dude. it was good okay. it's like jaws but with a lion. and the extent that with the extent. of how they went of the how far they. went to not say. that is unbelievable like it's jaws with a lion. that's what it is and if you're a [ __ ] you might think well it's no lines in the water. i think oh it's the jungle. the desert the south the south african and and the [ __ ] idris elba's the guy and they the the the the amount that they don't say that. is unbelievable because here's the thing when the rock. made that movie where he's the amputee. in the building skyscraper is that what it's called. whatever it was everyone was like dude. he has to get his family. out of the [ __ ] building from the terrace this is die. hard and immediately the rockos puts. up an instagram post. and says this movie i'm so proud of because i was such a huge fan. of die hard it's an ode to. die hard and then everyone chilled. out
