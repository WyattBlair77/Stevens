[ __ ] boxers like he just had a shirt on and san jose sharks boxers dude. the kid was 12. walking to the candy. store with just boxers on and uh that's something. i [ __ ] thought about in the past. eight months so i'm telling it. to you guys but dude. that's uh oh god i can't. wait to [ __ ] live that kind of [ __ ] with my kid just to. be like i talked to. my dad now you know. and i just i asked him. about [ __ ] you know about like is it okay if this and that and he's just like it's fine. like dude cal kelly hits. his [ __ ] head on everything he'll just [ __ ] be standing there and he'll just be like see ya and just do like what's the [ __ ] what's the thing in my head where a guy the image of the guy where he just oh oh what's the [ __ ] image where what's the movie where the guy's holding on to. the guy and then he just let's go. it's the [ __ ] and he smiles and lets. go [ __ ] whatever it is that's what cal. does dude there was one time. where he was kelly. was he had the [ __ ] uh he had this this string. that my my mom gave him a present. and he unwrapped it. with this string and he didn't give a [ __ ] about the president. but he just liked the string. so he tied it. around his wrist. and there was one time. where he just took it and and and looked at it. and he go and he went like this. and he and he pulled it. across like this and we went. whoa and he smiled and he just literally went. like this and [ __ ] tiptoed back and i used my mongooselike reflexes. to [ __ ] scoop him up and he was safe and i'm a [ __ ] hero for that um i love him so much dude he's almost a year old i can't believe it i'll post some pictures of him probably i don't know how i felt about that earlier but it just he's so sweet and i just um he's just great he takes my my glasses off all the time in the morning. he'll just be like he'll grab him. and then put him in his mouth. i'll be like i need those and i'll put him back. on and i'll just do him. again and just laugh dude. how about having a life. where you just think that. that's funny over and [ __ ] over again. we were watching blue's clues. the other day and the [ __ ] josh guy. was just going bing bing bing on his guitar. and callie would just go and then he would go ping ping ping ping and keller will go [laughter]. bing bing bing dude. that show it's i can't. even watch that [ __ ] these children. shows even with my kid because like it's like they make it's so easy. to figure this [ __ ] out and even though my kid doesn't even know how to. talk and all he does. is go it still is like we'll watch. bubble guppies and it'll be like hey we need to. it'll be like hey we need to.

[ __ ] understand who anyone is just by looking at their faces they need to. like look at their clothes and also see names. and hear their voices. okay maybe that's you if it is fix. yourself but still if that's how you are change it. and fix yourself but fine. my buddy swears that he has [ __ ] that and he's just like i don't know who that is man. i'm just like you've met him. nine times and he's just like i have that. thing where i can't understand. who someone is because of their face. i need to hear their voice. and i need to. see what they're doing i'm like all. right dude he also thinks he thinks he has that thing. where he can feel colors which is [ __ ] not. a thing so anyway this guy looks just like [ __ ] charlie hunnam. and he acts like charlie. hunnam and his name is jackson and charlie. hunnam's character in sons of anarchy. is named jackson k. and his last name is human. dude his last name is human. uh dude you changed your name. to jackson because charlie hunnam's character's name in [ __ ] sons of anarchy. his name is jackson and you changed. your last name to. human uh just do it just change your whole thing. to charlie hunnam that that. would be the [ __ ] dude if you legally. changed your name to. just charlie hunnam and you looked. like him but here's the [ __ ] best part. about the whole thing dude. he has a [ __ ] sons of anarchy. back tattoo that's the size of a goat. okay it's the size of a [ __ ] armadillo and it's on the back. and it says sons of anarchy. ha and that's all good but ha okay you got his sons of anarchy. tattoo sides of an armadillo on your back. now it's all good but also ah now choo doon and he's a [ __ ] stripper that's it. dude that's it he's a stripper and he did. a stripper dance to. one of the girls and when he did it. he [ __ ] came out with a slide. like an usher slide and his hair which was gelled. back [ __ ] jutted forward a little bit and i fell down i fell down dude nothing is funnier than a guy. who thinks he's the [ __ ] nothing is funnier. than the guy who thinks he's playing. it cool when he's not and he's the [ __ ] [laughter] dude. and on the british. love island there's a guy. okay dude you gotta [ __ ] listen to. me man this reality show. is the best [ __ ] reality show. there's a guy in love island. that is a [ __ ] dude he's coupled. up with this girl he falls in love with this. girl and he's so insecure. and he's always trying to. make sure the girl likes him. and [ __ ] and the [ __ ] producers of love island put the [ __ ] put his ex they introduce his ex on the island so now the x is on the island and he's trying to. make sure that the girl. is okay and he's all like no. it's cool it's my ex. i'm all over her it's fine. but we're all over everything's over. it's fine i'm with my new. girl now and he starts the way. he plays it cool. i have to play. you the just the audio of it. just the audio of it. i texted it to. my friends last night and i said this. is the funniest thing that has ever happened. on tv [ __ ] and i'm gonna show you it but i need to. give you context first so this guy fell in love with this. girl on love island and has been dating her. for three weeks and every now and then they introduce a new guy. or girl on love island. and it really shakes. things up because it tests. people's relationships obviously so three. and a half weeks. into this show this guy who fell in love. with this girl's ex. shows up on love island his current girl. is pissed naturally and he's trying to. make sure she's okay and reassure. her but this dude. obviously is really shook by. his ex showing up. and still has at least some feelings. for her so he's walking away. with his current girl. trying to make sure she's okay. and this is what happens. his name is tom so i'm just gonna play. the audio of it there's nothing i think is fun. that is funnier than this. type of thing i think if you listen to. this podcast you know that's good to. get back so is it. gonna bother you is it. gonna bother you not at all. hey everyone let's watch tom being not.
