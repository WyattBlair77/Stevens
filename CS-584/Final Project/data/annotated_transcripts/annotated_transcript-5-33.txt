plugged in it's out of here. but is that it i'll do it. so so one fire starting. off already and that's not it. okay well whatever its if it dies. it dies if he dies. he dies it's got some up. there we need to. fix it we get so nervous. is we need to. fix that we're having a [ __ ] technical difficulty you cuz you're [ __ ] wanna fire so we so so i was in la or no i'm sorry i was in what the [ __ ] was i when i was listening to. this watching this [ __ ] i was in i first of all i can't even can't tell you a house. a [ __ ] [ __ ] one fires looking trying to. get her on the studio. behind the camera to. try and [ __ ] plug in the the sound thing because he looks extremely submit. but uh i can't find what. you know what it is well. we got to find. it right are those gonna go he's gonna start. over okay so i was in where was that. when i was doing that. oh i stayed in philly and when i stayed in philly i. was like there was this infomercial. that came on called peabo bryson 'he's. classic r&b or classic. soul hits or whatever now. people bryson was an old singer. that looks a little bit. he was like the free. he looks like i don't know. how old he is now. but he did he was like a soul singer. and like a nate but like nate dogg. but like he look a little bit like nick. doll like he was bald. and [ __ ] but it would the infomercial that i saw do you guys watch infomercials cuz i watch him for merciless. man and i love watching. infomercials because they make me feel because i don't really have to. pay attention but also they're selling. some [ __ ] and i know they don't believe in it. now that's the best they don't believe. in that this one. is a little different maybe. people bryson did like a lot. of the things that this. guy was saying maybe people present did like a lot. of things that did these guys. made him sell but he he was selling. first of all compact discs and its 2018. now it looked originally. when this infomercial was created. and it was created in 2005. so this thing's 13. years old and they still did. the thing where they were like if you call. in the next 18 minutes. you'll get this free like no. man so you know. that those are [ __ ] you know those. are [ __ ] now you never need to. call the next one they're like if you call. in the next 10 minutes. you'll get you know those are [ __ ] because this was made in 2005. and they were still doing it. 13 years later so 13. years later you can be if you call. in the next 13 years. you can still get what. the [ __ ] it is you want to. get it was 13. years later now i watched this. [ __ ] now first of all you don't know here's the thing one fire go. the other way you know. anyway um i got to. do a little bit of a technical. difficulty here i got to. plug this in here so you guys. [ __ ] hold on one. second while we're got while you were holding on you. know what we're in it. we're in it we're in it. host hit his head so hard. on the [ __ ] thing god i wish you could see how it's a [ __ ] you want fire. lux trying to get around. the studio alright so so people preston is doing this [ __ ] and they're all the songs like by lionel richie and marvin gaye and [ __ ] like that and they're talking about how great it is but when you watch you ever watch like a football play that happened last week it always looks like it's from the 80s did you ever notice that if they're like do a show a little bit of a clip from a last week's game it always you're always like why the [ __ ] does this look like it was so it looks like a copy of a copy of a copy that's so grainy like but but this [ __ ] 2005 it's crazy how different broadcasting was in 2005 so first of all they're selling compact compact discs and they're doing it still in 2018 hey guys get with it okay also people bryson change your name of course peebo uh you know peebo bryson so so it really but the thing about it no i had a really emotional weekend and this is what started it off i was watching this infomercial and it was just so insane to. see this [ __ ] an infomercial i saw 13 years. ago to see how different the world. is now like you can't. buy a compact discs even. i don't know who the [ __ ] might like literally they're trying to. sell the last few that. they have to. the people dying tomorrow you know like a 90 year. old is just like i want to. get this i want to. get this cuz i like all those soul songs. and i've been looking for that. marvin gaye song you know and so i was sitting there watching these info. this infomercial and it was really affecting. me in a real way. i started thinking about how it used. to be when i was a kid. now by the way in 2005. i was 25 i was barely a kid. but it was just the whole nostalgia. of it made me feel like i was young. again and i was like wow. man it's crazy how much has changed since i [ __ ] we since in in in [ __ ] 13 years so now i go i do that i do a gig in new jersey which i'm from new jersey okay and i played trenton new jersey which is the college of new jersey which hey college i appreciate a name like that the college of new jersey if did if i had a college for that your god that when people are like nah it's cool to. have [ __ ] like i don't know many colleges. because i'm an idiot but like some of them. are called like like duke like what the [ __ ] you know pick wherever you are. that's what it's like when i say about. the band's like you're supposed. to be named the beatles. or the birds or the [ __ ] lions you know don't get all [ __ ] death cab for cutie [ __ ] on me with your college [ __ ] oh

then i went and i played dc which was fine. whatever then i went to. play carnegie hall in new york. and it was insane. here's the deal man carnegie. hall is the most traditional traditional most legendary probably venue. or at least theater in the in america. and it was in new york. they started it in 1891. and i was like trying to. get ironed out all the details. before i got there like oh yeah i want. to get i want to. sell merchandise i want to. want to do it. before the show usually my opener mike. he gets out there. and he sells merchandise he sells. our merchandise before the show. and he loves doing it. and he goes ourselves before. the show and then he sells it. after the show carnegie hall was. like can't sell it. before the show and i was like why. that makes no sense and i was like because there's an intermission i was like what. there's not intermission in my [ __ ] comedy. show and they're like no we got to. do it because they make a lot. of money a lot. of these theaters they make a lot. of money in intermission because the [ __ ] bar. sales in the intermission and i was like well i don't want to. do it they were like well then there's a fee and i was like go. [ __ ] yourself dude there's a feed they wanted to. charge me for not having an intermission at. so i was like no tell him. no and then my managers came. up to me as i saw. i tried and i'm like it's fine. about like we're gonna have to. pay so we're gonna have to. i was like alright that's fine. then i'm just gonna walk out afterwards. it's fine we could so. i said can we sell merch. in the intermission he said yeah. so i said ok good. so then then we're all good. they wouldn't let mike sell the merch. so they had the [ __ ] guys at carnegie hall. sell the merch so now. by the way i hate was emergency merchandise but i'm i'm a coda. i guess so they [ __ ] sell on the merch. and we didn't make as much money. as we usually do. which is fine but then afterwards. we sold the merch. anyway whatever it doesn't matter about. the merchant what matters. is i was getting pissed off. before the show i was like i know but about i hired. a photographer and they were like you can't. take pictures here here here. here here here here i was. like what the [ __ ] can you take pictures like in the back. or outside ah quite a. higher so anyway i'm paying this. guy a bunch of money to. shoot the [ __ ] night right. by the way everybody okay. so i'm pissed off. at the at the venue. right and they're like oh by the way. he needs to. come and do a mandatory soundcheck and i'm like what i'm a [ __ ] comedian. not the killers i'm not death. cab for cutie i'm not [ __ ] sparkle horse dude. did put out a monitor and a microphone. we're fine they're like now. we want him to. walk around this theatre and get a feel for it. hey man every shows. are the same i live in the [ __ ] what's that. bill murray movie over and over again. groundhog day i live in every day's the [ __ ] same i go i do my [ __ ] it's fine if i need to. adjust i do it in [ __ ] one bill. a second cuz it's from a job. so they they're like he by the way. he has to show two. and a half hours early. at the soundcheck which is the worst. shitty amount of time. because i gotta go. before i don't have enough. time to go back. to chill and then come back. so i just gotta hang there. for two and a half hours. but up pop by yeah. go [ __ ] yourself no but then in the back. of my head i'm like well i'm still got to. make this [ __ ] money so let's relax. so i'm trying to. get to the [ __ ] soundcheck i don't go two and a half hours early i go an hour and a half early which is fine. we we settled on. what negotiation [ __ ] you don't even need to. negotiate so i'm there and i walk in the theatre i walk into. the actual theater and it like hits. me that i'm playing carnegie hall. which by the way i didn't even. think about i told my dad. that i was gonna play. carnegie hall and he started crying because he's from new york. his dad my grandpa. used to sell newspapers. on the corner outside in [ __ ] new york. city and my dad said wow. i've only seen george carlin there at the [ __ ] eye carnegie. hall and i can't even believe you're gonna i'm gonna dat's the next time i'm gonna see you carnegie hall. is you wow and so for father's day. i got him a vintage george. carlin shirt and he looks at me and he starts. crying and he says i'm gonna wear this i'm gonna wear this when you play. carnegie hall and i said oh cool is it because you know why and i do know why because he's a buddy he'll told me again. my dad's a master of saying [ __ ] 75 times he was like because i saw george carlin play carnegie hall. and that's the only i know that's the only other time. no no but that's the only other time. i've been to carnegie hall. and it was in the step. no no it was in the seventy. but it was in the 70s. okay no i know that how do you know. that because you tell me. that four hundred seventy five times. he says well and he's crying. okay my dad is so sentimental. he cries at the end. of [ __ ] every tv show. he watches right i'd be like that what's going. on is i just lauren order. so so so i get to. carnegie hall and when i step on the stage on the stage to. do the soundcheck or whatever which by the way. this is the soundcheck oh cool one. two great works out right. so i get out there. i step out onto. the stage dude it's actually breathtaking. this stage if you've never been to. carnegie hall it's so [ __ ] annoying how goddamn beautiful it is it's annoying that you can't go in there with a bat i was like you know what i'm gonna go and i'm gonna talk to. the guy in charge i'm gonna give him a piece. on my mind i'd be like you care. saw merchandising the beginning that's so ridiculous. i get out there. and i'm like it's gold the theater. is golden white it's beautiful. and you don't realize how many times you've seen. it like on in movies. and on tv and [ __ ] like that i don't know how by the way. because i don't know how the [ __ ] they filmed. because they're not allowed to.

[ __ ] which started it off i'm telling you that started off my nostalgic. weekend my the crying all. my family members and [ __ ] be in there carnegie hall. i was i was just on an emotional roller. coaster right so then i go to. play montclair new jersey which is where i'm from and i'm playing montclair. new jersey and my best. friend from montclair new jersey. who i used to. live next door from people. don't get to. do this dude he hits. me up and he's like hey do you want to. get in to you or old. house that you grew up. in and in my head. i go like this no because it's gonna be too emotional. for me but i had already but joke's on you. that's that conversation happened. a week before i'm telling you. and i said yes already so it's like pulp fiction. now i'm telling the story you don't. know what the beginning is. and what the end is. so so now i go see the [ __ ] old house i grew up in dude. and i don't want to. give you the address. cuz you guys are crazy. and you'll show up but i go and i stepped it. now it's been 25. no it's been 26 seven. years since i've been in that house. 26 years and i step in and my [ __ ] i'm overwhelmed with emotion already. from the from everything. in the weekend and i'm in the house. i grew up in and i and all these [ __ ] emotions are flooding back. to me i'm like oh my god this. is where i asked. my mom if i could say the word. [ __ ] for the first time and she said ok and i got scared and i ran away. i said then at the in the dining. room i was like hey mom can i say. the s word it's a swear. word and she said yeah and i said what. really and she said sure you could do it. once and i said now i'm too. scared and i ran away like a [ __ ] [ __ ] ok and then i was like oh this is the [ __ ] these are the stairs i ran down during for when when we that one christmas and i and i ran past my brother cuz they told they told my brother to. let my brother go first cause he was. littler and i thought that was [ __ ] so i blasted. right by him and his head hit the [ __ ] side of the wall and he and he didn't miss the smile and we have video of it. dude one time i was running. now for christmas and my brother. my brother was running. down for chris was walking. every christmas he's going too slow. cuz he had little legs. and i was a little bit older. and and and they were like let matt go first. let matt go first and i blew right. by him and i hit him. into the wall and he was smiling. because it was christmas. and his head hit the [ __ ] side of the wall. and he didn't stop smiling and kept walking. and dude we laugh cuz it was so funny. cuz he was just he knew. he hurt himself but he was still. too excited cuz santa came. real [ __ ] dude that is real [ __ ] man so and i was like oh this was the [ __ ] part where i realized i had ocd this was the moment where i realized i had ocd because i was lining up my micro machines in a row and uncle vinny with the [ __ ] two wallets came over and sat down before underberg and he was like hey what's this when i really liked it and i screamed at the top of my lungs because he missed. he messed up my cars. he messed up my micro. machines man they were supposed. to be on the line. he picked one up and he wasn't supposed. to do that and in my little head. with ocd that was his fault. he picked up a car zone. he wasn't supposed to. and he put it back. because i screamed like a [ __ ] [ __ ] ass whatever dude it's what makes me me. no she did doctors will tell you that's not. what makes you who you are. because ocd is a demon. and it's not a part of you but i would argue it. helps with the creativity now is that a [ __ ] bad thing to. say to people who have ocd. yeah cuz maybe it will make your feet into. your own ocd yeah but don't do that. i guess but also if it could it could be gene okay. if you're [ __ ] if you have ocd and you were really into. math and that helps you do. math it could be jane. or it could be [ __ ] serial killer and keep [ __ ] heads in your freezer. so anyway i was like oh this. is the part this is where and they opened. up walls and they built. here's the other thing. too when you go back. to a place that you haven't. been to in 25. years it's so much and now it's so much. it shrinks i don't give a [ __ ] what people say. purely like oh but you were. littler and your memory distorted it nope. things get smaller i walked into. that house it was so much. [ __ ] smaller than i remember it and guess what that's not my fault. it [ __ ] shrunk my house. shrunk dude um i was walking. downstairs and i was like oh this. is the moment but this is the moment. where ice are i where i remember starting. the moment i know the moment. i believed i started believing. in god and i'm not saying i believe in it. anymore i don't know who knows. if there's a [ __ ] god or an afterlife i don't [ __ ] know and if you say there is one if you say there isn't one you [ __ ] idiot because guess what you don't know you know why you're live and anyone who's alive hasn't died. yet you saw a bright. light you almost died cool. that's your mind [ __ ] with you doesn't mean [ __ ] doesn't mean [ __ ] [ __ ] diddle in thenthenthen so um so now i am i remember the moment i believing in god when i was a kid one other kid i believed in god dude how [ __ ] kid is it to. believe in god you know. how i started believing in. god when i was a kid. i was uh i was looking for some i don't even. remember what it was but was it. was a toy and let me tell you something. it was very [ __ ] important. okay i needed the toy. and i couldn't find it i looked all over. the house and i was standing at the top. of the stairs in the basement. cuz i was on the east coast. and east coast have basements. and west coast don't have basements. for some [ __ ] reason but that's how it is in america. so i said god. in my head as a [ __ ] crazy little ass [ __ ] ocd ass [ __ ] [ __ ] i was like god if you just tell me where this [ __ ] toy is i will believe in you and right then i thought oh gods telling me god's telling me it's in the basement. under the end table with the lamp. on it and i ran downstairs. and i looked under the end. table with the lamp on it. and there was the toy and i sat. on the floor and i thought oh my god there. is a god i didn't realize that my mind. is my mind and i can come. up with those ideas by myself. in my head god put it now. here's the here's the thing people still think of [ __ ] like that and they're adults and they're not they don't live in [ __ ] like tribes. and [ __ ] they have like walls and toasters and an actual functioning society. and people still think god give them. ideas like that now those people you're crazy. okay you're a crazy lunatic. why because that's your mind. but i was [ __ ] eight and that's when i was like there's a god so i just want you to. know if you're an adult. that thinks that you're eight. secretly eight um but that's what i started. believing in god yep and then there was i was i looked at the [ __ ] back window. and i remember the back window. i remember that's where i got my first [ __ ] boner. dude i remember that's where i got my first boner. man where i started. to like chicks because i was what i was i was i was looking at the the glass windowpane i remember playing with toys in the glass windows. paint with my [ __ ] neighbor julie and she was a little bit older and we were playing with toys in the glass window pane and it looked the grouts the window pane shrunk dude it shrunk i didn't get bigger it shrunk dude and my memory is shrunk and so and so we're playing with toys and i saw the [ __ ] and i was like damn dude i kind of wanted to. like touch julie that's how i got my first boner. i was probably toys and a wit near the window. dude they redid the kitchen. they put another balcony and over into. the balcony i was like oh dude. they don't have this balcony anymore. they made it in they covered. it and i was part. of the inside and i was like this. is where i broke the indestructible. plate so i was like my mom. told me that the plates. were indestructible and that you could drop him and there britain they don't break. and so i was trying. to [ __ ] impress my friend keith. testa and i was like these don't [ __ ] break look and i came out. went outside and i took the plate. and i was like i dropped it. on the stone and it shattered into. a million pieces and i looked at keith. and i was like oh it's supposed. to not break and i was like my brother. unbreakable plates i just like you can't throw him on the [ __ ] ground. outside don't call him. [ __ ] unbreakable place that's how i started developing personality all sorts. of [ __ ] i got to. do ads [ __ ] but then i remembered also there's a park behind the [ __ ] plate i mean i remember everything man we used to. in the park we used to. [ __ ] bury dirty pictures me and my [ __ ] best friend matt we used to. bury pictures of girls with [ __ ] from playboy that [ __ ] thomas used to. take used to give us cuz he was the older. kid that had [ __ ] bad parents he had to. [ __ ] play boys. and he would rip out. the pages and he would give us us he would give us pictures. of nude chicks or [ __ ] those potato. skin treats that we you would have i would go and he'll be like y'all. give you a picture of this. chick if you [ __ ] give me your potato. skin bytes and i'd be like yo. say no more fam here are. my potato skin bytes let me. see that [ __ ] chicks teddies and he would give me them and i put him in my pocket. and i feel like [ __ ] thumb thumb thumb thumb thumb in second grade all around the [ __ ] school in the playground. through [ __ ] recess through language arts. i will be [ __ ] keepin titties. in my pocket dude. and i've got teens in my pocket. and the other one is touching my boner. later man so then i went and i buried the [ __ ] pictures of titties in a base in a baseball [ __ ] card box and i buried him in the back of [ __ ] jannik or brook park and the [ __ ] kid who lived on the other side of hannibal carr brook park this mother [ __ ] [ __ ] ass told my dad about it he came back and was like mrs. li i want you to. know now this is where i learned. some [ __ ] dude my my dad he told my dad. he was like i want you. to know chris and matt are doing. some bad [ __ ] and my dad. said oh yeah what and he knocked on this.
