it was like months later i think uh let me look it up in my texts here uh and uh i brought it up in the in the in the family chat it should be a here we go a screenshot oh here we go yeah and it was when was it um i don't know what it was doesn't say but i said just out of the blue this was maybe not even a month ago and i write you guys didn't react enough when i burned my eyes on christmas. and my dad said by the way. that no haha bubbles no love bubbles no. upper not even they didn't even. disrespect me they antirespected me i got the antirespect none of that. just give me a thumbs. down like i always say when you're in a [ __ ] room. and you're trying to. do standup don't not laugh. at least boo so i could feel like somebody laugh. sure but don't not laugh. don't be the guy at the comedy. show that's just chilling. you might as well have sunglasses on and you're like brought my date. what is it a ted talk. at least boo at least go. boom i want to. know how you really feel man. so um yeah i said you guys didn't react. enough when i burned my eyes. on christmas and then my dad. writes that's right we didn't and to. add insult to. injury to take that. knife that's been sitting there. for months in my chest and look me. in the eyes and push it up. to my neck someone gives him. a haha dude someone gives him a haha baba. so not only do i get no haha. bubble when i bring up. the [ __ ] hilarity my dad says that's right. we didn't and he gets a ha ha. bubble now i can't tell who did. it because it's a screenshot. so you can't click on it. but i bet that that person is sitting right. here in this room right. now and then someone says oh no then my mom. says and we never will. okay so let's just [ __ ] trace it back. you guys didn't i say you guys. didn't react out of the blue. nobody was texting each other all. day i said you guys didn't react. enough when i burned my eyes. on christmas my dad hits. me back with that's right. we didn't someone ha has him i didn't get one and then after that my mom agrees with my dad and says and we never will and then my mom gets a ha ha. okay now this is why. i'm really pissed it's because my dad. already did the joke. if you want to. give him a ha ha. and not me the ha ha. fine but don't give the person who does the same. joke after my dad another [ __ ] haha sure enough there's a ha ha and i have a feeling that the person who did it is sitting right here in this [ __ ] room right now and then i write doubling down stand on my ground dude imagine myself as a [ __ ] archangel sitting in my [ __ ] absolute positivity and i write back it really burned a lot i get nothing dude and then my mom writes what a doofus with an exclamation point have you heard someone call someone else at doofus in the past 25. years because i didn't i only heard doofus when the word doofus came out and for a month or two it was gone. after that my mom held on. to that like a sevenyearold me. and some halloween candy. dude i used to. hold [ __ ] almond joys. to next halloween and i'd be like mark can i still eat. this and she'll be like hey son that's stale. you doofus then my dad follows up. with my mom who already slammed. me and he writes good thing. you're texting about it now. though sarcasm now if you read that in a script. it would say dripping with sarcasm above. it no hahas then i write because i know. my son calvin agrees with me. and my mom says prove. it and then my dad. says a baby always recognizes another baby. and he got a haha and then i pretty much. it was done but then i said did. you guys believe that it hurt. so much and then i don't see what's beyond. that because it was a text. but it was a screenshot. what a [ __ ] [ __ ] i am for real whatever dude my parents made me um and i met calvin and that dude pretty much i'm sure understands why my eyes. were hurt so bad i'm gonna tell him. when he gets older. i'm gonna tell him you know. one day my eyes were hurt. so bad and then this happened. and then so that's what me. and my family were doing. i actually look i know who did the ha. has because kristen sent me the [ __ ] screenshot. and the haha are blue. which means that those are the ones. that she did for [ __ ] sake dude. i'm a detective i [ __ ] figured it out and when you figure it out. that's the [ __ ] best feeling. in the world oh your hahas are blue. well i know who did it. [music] um so anyway uh postmates. won't stop ringing my doorbell when i order. it all that happens. is i [ __ ] put up a sign that says don't ring the doorbell. please baby you're sleeping. and they [ __ ] show up and uh there's no way they don't see the sun and they [ __ ] ring a door about i know. why oh wait no so here's what actually happened. i [ __ ] put in the postmates. thing please don't ring. the doorbell a baby. is sleeping they don't read. the notes on postmates. apparently and i can say that. now because they're not sponsors of this. show uber eats drivers. read the notes i write. in ubereats hey guys please don't run. the doorbell have a toddler and every time i don't even. know who delivers the food. it's like a goddamn ninja. works for ubereats sometimes i'm just like i hear i'm like oh the food's. here oh what the [ __ ] the food's. here dude i think i just saw a flash. of a sword getting. in a [ __ ] prius um i saw a [ __ ] uber driver an uber eats guy with a dope. car today it was weird. as [ __ ] this pandemic is getting to. everybody um anyway anyway uh so i get so sick of this. and when when your boy gets pissed. he works he works on it. and he's been working on. it and he's been in therapy. for it over the last bunch of months. and he's trying to. not get pissed because he learned. that anger is a huge reason. for why he is the way. that he is and he wants to. just be chilling he wants. to be sweet and kristen. says be nice and i say you know. what you're right but when i say you know. what you're right i feel. heat bubbling in my chest. so i gotta get rid of that. so talk to my therapist. about it and i try to. be good about it but this. postmates thing it happens every time postmates. shows up ding dong 11a i love i tell dude. ding dong 11 pm good thing. my baby sleeps like a rock. um so yeah so i say you know. what i'm leaving a [ __ ] note i'll show it. on the podcast but i wrote a note. on half of a paper. towel with a sharpie and the note. was crinkled up and i wrote leave. food with an arrow. under it and then next to. that i wrote no ring like a [ __ ] i i mean. it's not a paper towel with a shart. with a half with a sharpie. that's running out of ink and it's spelled. like a [ __ ] japanese guy trying to. learn english leave a food. no ring live food. so i [ __ ] put it there and kristen opens the door for something. else during the day. and she comes back and when she comes back. she looks at me like it's raining. tomato soup cans outside and i say what's going. on and she goes are you. [ __ ] kidding me and i'm like this. is about the cheating and she's like no this. is about the [ __ ] this and she shows me the thing and it looks like a [ __ ] ransom note and she says this can't be on our front door and i say why not it's [ __ ] to. the point it's succinct and she says because it looks like a [ __ ] ransom note and i say well what the [ __ ] who cares and she says i care which is something that i just won't ever understand who cares it's just a sign dude she ordered one on amazon that says like she was like so she was like not mad but she was like you can't talk you can't have this you have to. talk nice to people i'm like even it's a sign. just like even on a sign. you can't just say leave food. no ring they're gonna be like oh the biggest jackass of all. time lives at the [ __ ] it looks like it's on toilet paper. to be honest it's just no. respect and i'm like they're not showing me. [ __ ] respect dude i come from a family do. you understand i come from a family. my dad's great uncle used. to go to this drug store. and get his medication and every time the guy. went into the back. room to get the medication. my uncle stole something a little piece of thing. whatever it was 99. cents it was probably four cents. back then because it was [ __ ] the year 1290 or however old it was when my dad had a [ __ ] great grandpa or a great uncle and one day my grandpa went in his brother that guy's brother and he said listen the drugstore guy said listen um my dad told me the story when i was a kid he said listen to. this to to my to. my grandpa my dad's dad. um your brother you know. he's i know he's getting older. and um it doesn't really it. doesn't really bother. me and i i don't want to. bring it up to. him because he's never really stealing. anything big but i know every time. i go back to. get his pills he he. he takes something from the store. and i don't want to. make a big deal out. of it but could you maybe just talk to. him and and get him to. stop doing it this was back. in the [ __ ] 40s or whatever. this is when people used to. just be like hey let's work. it out on our own. you know hey look i know. you're stealing from me. but you talk to. him and you talk to. the other guy it's a real. italian thing how about you just talk to. him and he'd talk you have a talk you have a sit down. you used to. sit down you get jimmy. to talk to. him and then paul you'll come in and you talk you have a good time. carmine's there he'll give you his blessing. and nobody be stealing from anybody. i could give him his pills. you understand i'm gonna have to.

a little more. buttons so badly because that's what the extra [ __ ] 50. was i hit a little more dude. that it's toasted the way i want. i'm just saying if it's a little underdone hit. a little more

my brother. that i did something stupid. so i'm now in this. position who did you suck. in this is me now. okay i took the bread. and i [ __ ] and here i am dude. johnny breaks it down because somebody has to. break it down and my family. breaks it down dude but when i'm with my family. i break it down no no it's not stupid. already man took the bread. okay here's me i [ __ ] cut it and i put it in the toaster i decided after i put it in the toaster. it was too big and i thought it was gonna get stuck. the bread was too big. my dad has a toaster and he buys. bread that's too big to. go in the toaster okay. so what johnny figures it. out does is [laughter]. i had to transform from. johnny breaks it down real quick to. johnny figures it out. [laughter] and then i had to. go from johnny figures it. out back to johnny. breaks it down it was like the quickest. episode of transformers you've ever seen all. right so now the bread's smaller. [laughter] so now the bread's smaller. all right so he came over. and he said that's my dad. my dad comes over and he says do you want. to make it only toasting on the inside. or what he wants me. to use the goddamn bagel. button on a sandwich bread okay. i don't need to. use the bagel button because it's not a bagel you know how i know it's not a bagel because it's too long. for the [ __ ] toaster and a bagel is a circle. okay let's keep it moving. and i said yeah sure and he said then hit bagel. okay so i just was not even. i said okay sure and he says then hit bagel. and he's so happy. about it right. so he said it's also too big. and i said yeah it's too big. so i took it out told me. the bread was too big. i already knew it was. too big because i already because i took it out. and i cut it dude. all right so he's telling me. some [ __ ] i already know by. the way i'm just trying to. make a [ __ ] sandwich and he's lurking in the background. like a goddamn you know. what i mean and everyone's coming at me. because the bread was already inside. yeah and i said hit bagel. if you just want to. toast these okay but you're saying something. out of order that's the thing. dude i wasn't even talking about. that my dad likes to. talk about something else that we're not talking. about and that's what makes the conversation. so convoluted and that's why i had to. develop into being so. good that's why i'm [ __ ] johnny's johnny. figures it out at heart. and this isn't pulpit you're doing it. like this is pulp fiction. and it's not it's a straight. movie because you just it's not linear. you're saying something out of order. and this isn't pulpit you're doing it. like this is pulp fiction. and it's not it's a straight. movie it's a narrative that starts. from the beginning and it ends. at the end okay. my brother the [ __ ] peanut gallery. in the background and i cut off. the little piece of it. and to make it. fit i put it back. in and i hit bagel. and dad says you you are. you trying to toast it oh my god. dude i cut the bread. i put it in the toaster. i hit bagel and my dad comes by. you know how [ __ ] annoying this is a 72 year old man. walks by while i'm doing my business. and says you trying to. toast it dude what the [ __ ] who are you [ __ ] what are you a baseball color. com well you try to. toast it here he's actually trying. to toast as goodly cut off. a little piece because the truth. is the bread was too. long and his toaster was 175. and it has too many. buttons it's toasted nicely in a bagel fashion. yeah and he says well then i hit toast and then he [ __ ] makes it like it's my fault. because he said hit bagel. no and then my brother. says he said you gotta hit start. he didn't say i had to. hit start he hit start. and then he said hit bagel. so now i'm going backtracking. it's like i'm just trying to. [ __ ] toast the [ __ ] i hit toast and then he says hit bagel i literally heard him say you gotta hit start and then you look down and said you're going to. tell me that he said i already. hit it that was his fault. yeah it's all his fault. yeah no no it's not my fault. what's my what was my fault. all of it except the very end. when he said was wearing after when he said he got hit. and he had already started your friend's. done no look then my dad. comes in again dude. how annoying is this. dude my dad comes in again. and says your bread's done. but in the middle of him. saying the thing before that. and him saying the bread's done. i [ __ ] you not he goes into. the garage for what looks to. be no reason dude that is so [ __ ] disrespectful that we are in a conversation. and he walks into. the garage and comes back. and then tells me something. that i already know dude. look at him that's the garage. door opening oh he's throwing away. a [ __ ] empty water bottle that's where they put the recycling god that's [ __ ] disrespectful your friend's done no i hit it so it's it's done it's done because i only wanted it lightly [ __ ] toasted okay well then you could push that lever down look see that's the thing is why i said i i hit the button so it would come up it's done because i made it done and that's when he said you could hit that button he was pointing to. the button that says a little more. dude he wants me. to use all the [ __ ] buttons this sounds going. to come out look tasting. like a [ __ ] trash it's going to. be like a [ __ ] uh a log at [ __ ] um uh uh what is that thing that i used to. do called what was that. thing i used to. do called my mind's going. i need ginkgo biloba oh yeah. dude yes i don't remember [ __ ] cub scouts not cub scouts but [ __ ] [ __ ] something guide indian god yes probably actually that's racist now shouldn't admit that definitely could get canceled. ah indian guides yes that's what it. was i don't there's too many. levers so many buttons do you want. a plate yeah this is annoying. now he's still here hovering like a goddamn parakeet. trying to land on a statue or a pigeon buttons do you want. a place yeah yeah i would like to. play man do you want. to help me get a player. he said do you want. a plate yeah you know where the [ __ ] plates. are dick dude. so this is how you get to. the postmates [ __ ] why can't i get a plate. on my [ __ ] self dude why don't why do you have to.
