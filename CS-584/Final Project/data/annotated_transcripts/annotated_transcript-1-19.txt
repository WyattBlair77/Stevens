i guess i'm ready. dude uh i'm gonna get into. it i don't understand. all the stuff online. about joe koy i don't get why. everyone is roasting the crap. out of him i don't get it. i think this is just a frenzy that people are doing. this because of one cutway to. taylor swift and then another cutaway. to maybe someone else that wasn't laughing. and they just thought you know. what this it caught wildfire dude. i watched it and not only did he not doo. bad he did well i don't i don't. understand m i mean maybe the barbie. joke fell a little bit. flat but this is always what happens. at the golden globes this. is always what happens. at the golden globes i. mean ricky d probably gave the best. monologue ever in in in golden globe's. history and i i don't know if people are comparing him. to that but there's all this. these gigs are terrible. these gigs are terrible. to do they're actors and actresses they're famous. celebrities that that don't want to. get roasted and this is what it's become you know they think they want to. get roasted and then and then and then they're like but like they don't dude you think margo robbie wants to. get roasted for what for what you think taylor like taylor swift joke. this the biggest thing the most annoying. thing was the taylor swift thing. dude the joke wasn't about. her the joke was about what cucks. the nfl areb in for showing the relationship. she should be happy about what. he did because she's like yeah. you're right the nfl is too it's too. much but she she she they they cut to. taylor swift and she was like. i guess not laughing which by the way. you know you never know. what's on these people's mind. she it wasn't like she was. like this she would just drank a dr. she might have been already on. the way to drink it. while joe koy was saying. the thing and then and then the camera. caught her wally did the thing. and then that's it and then everyone's like oh wow. she straightfaced him you don't. even know what's going on in her. head number one number two say she was pissed. off about the joke. it's not it's not about her. it's about the nfl. okay and also you think taylor swift. why would why would why would anyone want. to ever get roasted if you're taylor smith. taylor smith taylor swift. why would you want to. get roast everybody in her camp is on her. nut so dude nobody's ever. telling her how it really. is she worth bell she's worth. a billion dollars she makes $400. million in merch in one show. you know nobody's gonna be everyone's gonna be like oh sucks. what sucks what he did. in her camp sucks what he did. that was rude yeah celebrities they don't first. of all they don't know. what they want they think they're going. to go a fun. roast show and then dude the jokes weren't. they were not bad and neither was you. know you want to. say oh yeah oh people my favorite thing. is oh he missed. the point about barbie he missed. the point he didn't get barbie. dude he just made a joke. who gives a [ __ ] it's so weird. it was so weird i was i i look i rarely. look online so because i don't like looking at like hate. stuff for anyone and but i did cuz you know joe's. a buddy and i watched the thing. and i was like i can't that people are saying it's bad. no no i watch it. i thought i feel like i watched a different. monologue i don't understand i think it's just one. of those things that caught fire. and people are like all right. yeah you know the the swifties or whatever were like this. was so stupid this. was shitty because he made a joke. at her expense expense and then. uh everyone just kind of jumped. on board i don't understand. it maybe i mean i guess. i'm the minority i i don't. even know if i am the minority. cuz this is just online. like 3% of people are on are are are are are online. or on twitter whatever. the whatever the [ __ ] i i it's just we i don't know what people expect in the go. are people expecting rick and deres ricky what ricky deres did. was right time right place. he's he's so funny you know. and and and he was just being himself. and by the way i bet. some of those jokes. fell flat too in the room. cuz he was i the people who saying that. jokoy bombed i just don't understand it. because you can hear the laughter. it's so weird am i maybe. i'm i'm not delusional oh yo he didn't. make [ __ ] tom hanks laugh. or he didn't make what call somebody. else laugh or whatever. it is what timothy shalam didn't. laugh timothy sport chet. didn't laugh wonka did well. huh i thought wonka was going. to was going to. tank wonka made money right. wonka movie uh box. office i thought wonka was gonna. okay wonka is number one. box office again again that's crazy. who gives a [ __ ] f. about willie wonka's origin. story you know they're going to. have [ __ ] there's so many origin stories now they're gonna have dave from uh wendy's origin. story remember him when he was a boy. he had a thing for redheads and square fried. chicken and square meat bro wendy thought they were doing something different. with the square meat get out of here bro. that's disgusting cubed ass. meat cubed ass meat. [ __ ] [ __ ] you cubed ass meat [ __ ] f so rude um wendy's was like cubed meat um yeah dude i mean i don't know people are so i guess it's a slow news. day with this [ __ ] it's like with the jco thing. and then the and then how crazy everyone went. for the cat williamson. which i talked about in the patreon. episode i i just don't like people think you know. you can just become famous. by saying hollywood is a macrocosm to. anyone's to your work. right to your career. because everyone sees hollywood. so everyone pretty much is pretty much. everyone is a is a in in some way. a failure right. like let's just get down. to brass tax here you're not living. the life you want okay. you're just not i got news. for you there's people like brad. pit probably not even living the life. he wants okay and i know. i know oh but well he could take his $200. million and [ __ ] buy an island and just go there with you know whatever a bunch of babes. and and [ __ ] make you know grow weed. if that's what he wants. to do right. i i know i get it. but money doesn't make you happy. it makes things comfortable for you. um but people think that you can you know. buy your way into. happiness but that aside take the money. thing out of it. most people poor okay. so even if you do add that most people when it comes. down to brass tax. we're all failures in a way. right we didn't do the thing. we wanted to do. whatever it is and that's fine. and i feel you dude. there's stuff in my life. i wanted to do that. i didn't get to. do you know i love my life. but i get it um so there is then there's hollywood. you look at kate. blanchett you look at. jennifer lawrence you look. at brad pit you look. at tom cruz you look at you know. kevin hart you look. at uh whoever these people are they're held up. on a pestal by a lot. of people but we want to. see them fall so much. because they couldn't have got it. through hard work or talent. because then that means i have less of that. i have less of that. oh yeah brad pit. got that [ __ ] because of the way the elite uh work their magic and he's in the illuminati. not that i didn't work. hard enough not that the cards. didn't work out for me. not that i'm the kind of person. that uh isn't talented. not to say that. brad pen's the most talented. guy on the earth. but i you know he's a good. actor and [ __ ] but it's like people want an excuse so badly so when cat williams comes in and says hey kevin hart. is a plant hey. uh cedric entertainer does. this joe rogan does. that then all of those failures. think i [ __ ] knew it i knew it i knew it wasn't because i didn't get off my ass. five days a week to. chase my dreams i knew it. and i know it's hard. it's hard as [ __ ] to. chase your dreams bro people talk. about hey never give up. your dreams dude i'm the first. to be like hey give up. your dreams dreams are hard. to actualize that's why they're dreams. you ever fall asleep and dream. something that you could do yeah. sometimes you tell anybody about that. dream no why because it's not. interesting you tell people about. the crazy dreams because that's what's interesting. i had a dream to. become a standup comedian that [ __ ] was hard. as [ __ ] i went i did shows at la mats i did. shows in [ __ ] where w houses and comic book stores people's houses. and hosts i did. [ __ ] trash gigs it was hard am i living my dream. you don't know you don't know. you don't know what makes you. happy so when you look at a thing. like cat williams mouthing off on all. these [ __ ] you could be like yeah dude that's why that's why i didn't make it as an opera. singer when in actuality you. weren't working on your oh as much as you should have. you weren't working on. your as much as you should have because you were too. busy eating funions playing [ __ ] dark knight. or whatever video game it. makes too much it's there. will always be that feeling too. i don't know it's people love. watching people [ __ ] i don't know this is just me saying [ __ ] what the [ __ ] do i i i what what do i know dude i'm just a guy who posted a [ __ ] thing on threads that said something about uh sunglasses hey i saw a guy wear look at this look at this [ __ ] i posted on threads that that that [ __ ] instagram thing the facebook uh one third day in a row someone with sunglasses at the gym somebody write so um here look uh let me just go down and look at okay and like imagine writing just being someone in [ __ ] st petersburg florida you know and a comedian that you don't even like right like this person doesn't def you don't hate me they're just like this is a who cares response to. just write to me. a comedian okay and like they just [ __ ] crazy look at this. look at this third day. in a row you haven't. minded your own business huh. this is threats what do. you also the thing that the person. always gets mad at online. is always you can always direct it. back on themselves right like who asked you. oh i didn't ask you. oh you just sit on the internet. and [ __ ] about people well what's you doing wait there was one in here i caught there's a bunch of them here um look at this. look oh wow this is great. this one's great there's actually one guy. in the jim who wears them. every single time i'm beginning. to think he may. have an eye condition. though it just seems improbable. that he'd always wear them. but he's but it is weird. seeing someone bench with shades on. you know look at this. look at this some people may. have some people have sensitive eyes. i wear sunglasses most of the time. otherwise i'm my eyes sting. oh yeah dude is that right. is that right is that right. someone in bend oregon hey dude. okay hey did you get your prescription. of boring pills filled dude. look it wait there. was another good one though. most of these responses are. fine the lighting can be unpleasant don't judge okay. oh oh yeah i should just write. by to oh yeah there was one. maybe it was deleted but oh wild. guy i don't know i i don't know oh here we go. oh here we go here. here this is my favorite. yeah but some people with low. visibility and light sensitivity like myself don't need your rubbish. opinion about how it about about it. thanks you should probably well. first of all they say you should probably remind. your own business remind it hey dude. remind your own business also. so british to. call someone rubbish you know that's absolute rubbish. your your your opinion your opinion. is absolutely manal it's rubbish. me what is going on. i said makes no sense. let people mind their own. business let people wear sunglasses at night oh knows. what if he's a little boy. what if he's the little boy. in in anatomy of the fall and you just didn't realize it. was him what what if it. was the little boy the little blind. boy with the glass out eyes. with the cloudy vision [ __ ] in a in in in the movie. that was the

movies. where like that'll just be about a wizard. and sometimes i know that there are big. big movies about wizards and dragons. that i have no idea that. they are and i understand. that those are probably blockbusters. okay all right or if it's just a movie. with like mel gibson. that i've never heard of that. came out in the past. five six years i get it. because mel gibson people. are watching him number one. because they love mel gibson. and number two because they want to. watch a movie to. hate on because they think he's an antisemite. right okay so okay but when i see a movie that i have no idea. what it is and it's called. called something boring as [ __ ] like anatomy of a fall and it's number eight. and i'm and i'm on the i'm on the couch. i'm i'm on a couch picture. me

you. know um yeah dude i just i i it's so crazy. to me you know. i don't know imagine being in [ __ ] god imagine not imagine not like imagine something where you're in on trial. for something dude that's the craziest thing. is the people who are innocent. the people who go to. trial and then get cleared. and are actually innocent bro. they had to go. through that how about that how about being totally innocent. you ever think about that. but you got to. go through a trial oh no and then a lot of times they'll go. through they'll win and then they they go like this. psych we got to. do it again what bro. i was watching i was watching this. um trial on dat it. was like dateline it was. something with kei morrison you know. where he's just standing out. in a field for no. reason near a ladder well it was a beautiful. night for karen except for the fact. that she died it was [music]. raining so full of life. b deny that's keith morrison so full. of life of a d night when she took her last breath. i'm lester holt here's the guy. that'll announce here here's i'm lester holt. i'm the announcer of the show. that has an announcer this. is dateline today we'll discuss. a crazy case let me introduce. you to the guy. who's going to introduce you to. the case i'm ler i'm basically. dead space my job. shouldn't exist i'm like a segment. producer on chemel um but yeah i know. so i was watching the thing. this lady had to. go on trial four [ __ ] times until they convicted her hey dude if you don't get it right the first time i feel like it's done if you can't get if you're a prosecution and you can't get people you can't gather up enough evidence for the first time hey dude that guy deserves to. go oh well we're letting a killer. on the loose yeah well the prosecution was [ __ ] busy not working hard right. okay they didn't gather up. enough evid it's all uh what do you call. it uh circumstantial dude what about crafty. killers who get away with it can you be so good at your job. that you get that you do. like ninjas you know they don't get caught. imagine the ninja on. trial he'd have to. get like your honor. he obviously did it look. what he's wearing first of all. second of all he's so good. at killing and that's why. we didn't know it was him. because he's so good at it. and he was so quiet. there's no fingerprints of course. because look at his hands. he's got gloves i rest my case. he's like i and then the prosecution i i there. is no he has no alibi number. one number two there were hints of just fizzing. at the mouth ninja got with one. those or poison him. a day po po po po. poison him with a time. release capsule you know uh anyway what the [ __ ] i i just can't believe imagine going on trial four times for something and then f dude and that's what like 15 years of your life you might the stress dude you'd probably like i dude if you had to. go on two oh man. that's [ __ ] crazy dude anyway [ __ ] what a what a what. a i what a wacky episode. i i just came out the gates and that's good. but uh oh speaking of courtroom. drama this [ __ ] os oscar. pistorius was released pistorius pistorius pistorius olympic athlete. convicted of murder is released. it's crazy if anyone who kills anyone. is ever released by the way. how long do you think you should go. to jail if you kill. somebody i like what is this. 25 to life [ __ ] it should just be life or we should just come up with another amount like dude i'm sure killers don't want to go to. jail for 10 years just make it 10. years or make it life. don't the south african sprinter. whose trial for the 200 2013. killing of his girlfriend drew. intense global interest sered more. than seven years in prison. and he and he got and he got out. oh cuz it's in south africa. right they don't know what they're doing. hey let them out h. i don't know what what what was. he in for i don't know. look it up a [ __ ] it it's crowded. let him out um oscar. pistorius the south african athlete. hailed as an inspirational figure until he was convicted. of killing his girlfriend was. released on parole on friday. for more than after more than seven. years in prison i watched. the uh documentary on this. dude um yeah god i can't i i go. back and forth i have a thing that i do in my head. i have a game well it's not a game it's just like a you know. i have ocd so i i like i have like interest. of thoughts but i have this uh thing where i think because i don't know that i don't know the i don't know the answer. to this but ask yourself. this would you rather. kill someone or be killed yourself. now i get the kneejerk reaction is kill. someone because you don't want to. die okay and you have a lot. to live for i get right. i get it but deeply imagine killing. someone and i don't mean in selfdefense i'm talking. about you have a you have a choice. like if god or nicholas cage comes down. and is like hey you have to. make this choice kill. someone or be killed and they say like well who do you know. who do i kill they. say that's up to. you like you can't kill. it's not selfdefense it's not like you. have a threat i go. back and forth on that. dude i go back and forth. on that genuinely for a while all. throughout my youth up until i was like 35 i'd be like i would kill. i would kill someone. and then i was like i don't know if i could [ __ ] deal with that i don't know if i could deal with like i here's here's what i think i think i could block out the fact that i maybe i would [ __ ] it would eat me right the hardest part about it i'll say is i'd be walking around thinking like when are they going to. find out that is i can't. live with that when are they going. to find out when are they going. to find out i killed a [ __ ] the bagger at ralphs. you know i picked the oldest guy. i could i had to. like i he has a f. like i and and then just after like i was like in my 40s. i started thinking like i think i would just choose. to be killed because i don't want to. do that right and i was there. for a few years and then i was like no. now i now i'm at the point. where like i need to. be around for my kids like look at me. look at this this is what i this. is the [ __ ] i think of you. know how like you're at work. all day and you're like where are the reports. i got to do. this oh let me send that. email out this is me i'm here in this head space outside. outside of a [ __ ] aroan just like no you know what i'd kill. someone jesus christ got to. up my up my uh proac. intrusive thoughts for the win huh. um but yeah anyway i guess he killed her. he was convicted of killing. his girlfriend um oh yeah he's a double. ampute that's right cu he was a runner oh no no no the par olympic athlete. yeah wow man i need kill. someone with no legs they should they got to. let him out just for that. reason you know they're like well look we had to. put you in jail but it's pretty.

podcast you know these guys should even be hanging out let alone filming it aren't animals that's like a that's a c creature dude that's the problem of podcast now is is too many uh uh combinations of people are happening to. where you're like well they shouldn't even. be hanging out together people. are just like i want to. start a podcast you have a podcast. yet i got one yeah but you don't. you you got time to. do another one right. yeah let's do it what. it's a sea creature a fish. is an animal you can't go to. the zoo and see a fish. they don't have they don't have zoo. fishes there's actually so many fishes. there's fish zoos you can go. to a fish zoo. no there's so many fish. that they have their own. attraction called an aquarium. no they don't no that's these. guys have this what's weird. is these guys have the exact. same voice um okay i don't. know man you can have a pet fish. so another action card for us. to find and it looks like a good. one the first thing to. address is the gray. pants which tell us it's an away. game and instead of looking at the jerseys. let's identify the stadium we're in so we can see. what team the a's. are playing this guy just evaluates baseball. cars pictures of baseball car. trying to link the evan. williams brand to. something but obviously kentucky. doesn't have a pro. team the answer was actually right. there all along that would be the logo. for globl field home of the texas. rangers kemp played in nine games. that oakland was visiting the rangers. and the jersey lineup looked like this. so we can eliminate all. but two games now. he's listed as a second baseman and an outfielder so i thought this was a flyball catch it first somewhere. maybe along the warning track but thanks to. this panoramic shot of the field. we can see the entire outfield. has a yellow stripe to. indicate the dude this guy is just trying to. find find the day the baseball. card was taken the day. the baseball card picture was taken. this guy dude. there are too many. people in the world when guy can spend any amount. of time deciding what day. that i always did wonder that. though when i would see baseball. cards i be like how imagine you're doing. it you don't even know. what day that is like even if you're like you know hensley muin. or [ __ ] howard johnson you still don't know right. you be like i don't remember that. game that's pretty [ __ ] interesting what what what but this is who the [ __ ] that's clearly not in the picture so it looks like this this is taken either near or in foul territory he was super busy in the july. 23rd game but only had one popup to. take care of this. guy looked at the [ __ ] what happened. so guy's going to. catch a a base a baseball he's going to. see what games out of two. that he caught a baseball. like that a lead man. on base and garcia goes after the first pitch and that popup will. be handled by kemp. that one's just not even close. so let's look at the july. 9th match up where we get two. defensive outs but only one pop fly in foul territory here we go is it this one up the right fi that's the one that's the one that's the one that was way. more enjoyable than i thought it would be wow this guy they [ __ ] this guy needs to. be honestly he would needs to. work for the fbi he how many times is he gone. like this i'm way ahead. of you but has only been watching the blue. jays you know i'm way. ahead you it was john rood. i'm way ahead of you. wow incredible um we need to. take a break i need to. put my plug my computer. in it's going to.
