[ __ ] dude wow i love that actually [music]. we got the slides dude. boom very cool very cool. for the summer you get in and out of the pool. with that [ __ ] uh i'm a slide guy turns out i'm a slide guy i had no idea but you can also get the bucket. hat that we got i don't wear bucket. hats but we got the buck. hats got r a lot. of people wrote in where's the bucket. hat so we made bucket. hats dude life rips with that. og [ __ ] colorway with the bucket. hats though and there's a fly in here. dude and we can't even stop it. there's a fly in here. in this in the studio. the studio is small as [ __ ] okay and there's a fly in here dude and the fly's taking up too much. space so we got one. of these [ __ ] zap it things dude i said this is how we're gonna do because we tried to. [ __ ] get the the fly out of the thing and uh it wouldn't and we started the episode. and we had to. stop it because the fly was being so annoying. so what i did is i got the zap. it do it and i'm ready. now all i got to. do is push this thing in turn it. on push the thing in okay yeah got it. and then and when the fly comes i go. and and kristen's really good at it. and i'm so [ __ ] you kind of can't do it pop actually. that's kind of badass if i did it. like that but i don't i always end. up like doing it. like that and then go and then missing and then i catch myself. looking so [ __ ] dude but i got this. [ __ ] for the fly coming i don't know we'll see maybe because fly's live for like a day. and a half anyway right. so it's like maybe he died. already we don't know. but we stopped the podcast because it was so [ __ ] annoying he was like landing. on the [ __ ] thing anyway whatever dude chrisleya dot com for tickets. go to your go to. go go go and also if you like the podcast. take a minute to. just like and subscribe my babies you know because this is a [ __ ] this is a movement. all right i mean we're literally changing. the world with this. podcast um so yeah and my nose does. it work who knows who knows. if my nose works or not. it's been two and a half. weeks and they say by three. weeks it should be [ __ ] gravy and it's not even close to. gravy yet yay dude it's not all. gravy the doctor said keep it give it. three weeks and it'll be all gravy. it's been two half weeks. it's not even close. to all gravy yay dude it's not even close. to all gravy some people say. it takes a month. some people think say it. takes six months because there's a lot. of capillaries back there. and did calvin bonk my nose. three times this week yeah he did. he bonked it three. times this week dude. one was really hard and two wasn't that. hard um but it's fine. still feels like it did before. i got the surgery. maybe it didn't work maybe i'm one. of those [ __ ] 20 one out of 20. doesn't work the doctor said which you know. what that means 3 out of 20. doesn't work right because if a doctor says one thing. it's definitely more because they want. it to make it. seem like they're the [ __ ] artist. and they can do it better. than any other doctor but it's really more than one. because i looked online. and sometimes that said up. upwards of five out of 20. it. doesn't work yay dude. so we'll see that's one. out of four um but but you know hey look if we were going to. vegas with these odds. we'd come out with a lot. of money so hopefully. we'll come out of this. surgery with a lot. more air um and i sleep. better whatever um yeah man so like and subscribe. or whatever and make love to. that [ __ ] comment section go. in there and just make some love uh but yeah i really hope. this nose thing pans. out when i looked i looked and uh it's still very crooked my septum is still very crooked well now my septum isn't crooked. but the bottom of my nose is. still looks like it's trying. to point a certain way. um and i went in the other day. for my last uh what are they not postop but after the operation. checkup um a week a week a week. after and then another week after and then now i have to. wait a whole month. so if it's good in a month. i'm good he said the surgery. he thinks the surgery. worked though he saw it. and he's like oh yeah it. definitely worked he stuck. that [ __ ] thing up there dude so long so long numbed. it up nice stuck it. in there and i said are you going. to clean it out. and he said it looks good. and been thinking about that. since it happened because it didn't really. answer my question but it's all good. i don't know if it's clear. or not but uh i say you're gonna clean. it up are you gonna you're gonna clean. it out up there. and he said looks good. sir that's so bill. dalia how he answered. that [ __ ] question it's unbelievable. so bill bill delia how he answered. that question um i hate getting. my nose numb to. do it i think it's dude. i was talking to. my this guy i met he's a comedian. and um uh uh he's a comedian. i don't want to. give too much uh because it's kind of personal. information but he's a comedian. and he was talking about how he was like oh how did your nose. thing go and i told him. and he said yeah i said i'm he said i'm recovering from. a surgery myself and i said oh what he said. he got a vasectomy i i can't. a vasectomy i i i can't i mean. getting surgery in your head. and getting surgery in your pleasure. zone you know whether that's penis. vagina or anus right. and i said the clinical. terms so i can't get age. restricted here and we can't get demonetized because youtube's throwing that. [ __ ] out right but in your in under your penis and testicles. okay i'm very medical here. in this podcast because i don't want to. get age restricted right. so behind the testicles. and anus and or past. the penis right you get a vasectomy what they do. they they basically clip. your wings right okay you know. what i'm talking about you can't. get women pregnant anymore. and so he said he got a a a vasectomy and i'm like why. i i can't wrap my head. around someone getting a vasectomy i cannot wrap my head. around it okay now he's done. having kids he's had kids. he's with the same one. he's with his wife you know. he doesn't want to. have any more kids and that's pretty final right. so first of all there's the whole thing. what if you change your mind. okay fine you could just go. get another surgery and get it. reversed fine okay but also dude. just pull out all right. cause then they're not sticking knives. all in your pleasure. zone huh cause then you don't. have to have another guy poking around in your pleasure. zone with something sharp like an exacto. blade really do it really just pull out. little earlier and i said this. to him and he said well. the um the idea of not pulling. out and having an orgasm inside. my wife wow sounds worse. when you're clinical with it. really to be honest. i mean splurting sounds way. less gross to. me right um he says gets me so excited and i go huh. so excited to. have eggs to. have exacto blades sticking around. all inside your you're right. really close to. your anus and he says yeah and he said it. was three weeks later and he still feels. numb down there huh. just pull out dude i do it. so early right when i don't i mean. when we don't want to. have kids i do it. so early i do it. so early i could like read a magazine. in between when i pull out. and when i oopsy daisy i mean seriously dude. i read a whole magazine. of uh [ __ ] uh cosmopolitan pull out read a whole magazine. [ __ ] l magazine before i oopsie daisy you know what i'm talking about i mean jesus dude i swear to. god i'll pull out i'll read a whole. app i'll find out what's wrong. all in the back of highlights before i upsee. daisy dude i swear to. god man i'll pull out i'll do the new york. times crossword puzzle not even on a sunday. before i oopsie daisy that's the hard. version sunday's easy. one but i mean god damn dude. how are you bad at pulling. out you know why you're bad at pulling. out cause it feels too. good you chump back up. back up dude still feels good. what's that i mean. bacon's amazing it's not even like the difference between bacon and turkey bacon. turkey bacon [ __ ] sucks dude turkey bacon. sucks the only realness with bacon. is the real bacon dude. if you have crispier [ __ ] and by the way dude you better crisp that up that's like that's like squirting all up in it crispy bacon. dude pulling out early it's still kind of it's like bacon. that's not that crispy but it's still banging. it's not even like the turkey bacon. it's not like eating turkey bacon. dude it's not like eating. vegan cheese it's not like it. dude because you're still splurting i could. never get a surgery. i would never get an elective an elective. surgery i guess no mine. was medical i needed the doctor said my life. would be shorter if i didn't get it. so i got it he said i could die. later on he said you want to. be around with your kids. way longer i said yep. so i got it but i just can't. imagine getting a vasectomy dude. i'll just pull out man or stuff. some cotton up there or whatever. you know what i mean. it's like [music] put a split or where you. know condoms you know what they're not. i mean i would work you know. i would do that i mean. surgery dude crazy also they don't always work imagine you. got the vasectomy and it didn't work. dude you got the vasectomy and you still splurted and then you got a kid. and the kid shows up and you're like well we did. we

[ __ ] mouse 5 or whatever. and the robot's like the kid. mommy i am sorry. but you pissed me off. moscow ap i like how the [ __ ] [ __ ] always reminds you ap always reminds you that it's ap we know a chess playing robot grabbed the finger of its sevenyearold opponent and broke it during last week's huh you know the robot broke the child's finger sergey lazarev president. of the moscow chess federation told russian. tass agency of course this. is bad oh dude. you know i mean so russian. to have no the robot. broke the child's finger of course. this is bad if we get new child. soon no that's not the shouldn't we no. we get new child the child. has broken finger we fix. by getting new child a video shared on. social media shows the robot. taking one of the boy's pieces. and then grabbing his finger. as he attempts what the [ __ ] that move. is illegal mom now what will you do little [music]. sevenyearold crybaby um four adults then rush in struggling to. free the boy before leading. him away from the chessboard lazarev said the chess federation. had rented the robot that. appeared in many previous events. without incident well he didn't play. with a brat probably he said the boy. was able to. play again the next day. and finish the tournament with his. finger in a cast. i mean jesus dude. this is insane what did you just say. to me tommy me [ __ ] you crybaby [laughter]. that move is legal but it sure. isn't nice [music] crybaby unbelievable. dude that's it we gotta pack it. up ai this is the beginning. of the matrix um how about the fact. that this [ __ ] you know it's like this. whole thing about trans uh. with the dave chappelle thing. he's obviously like you know. one of the best comedians. ever uh he's really [ __ ] a dog with a bone with this trance stuff which you know do what you want man. and i get it it's a bigger. issue it's about freedom free speech but this [ __ ] dude this is so ridiculous they canceled a show in minneapolis first avenue is a theater thing they cancelled a show. in minneapolis um hours. before it started and then they apologized. for booking him dude this. is hilarious in the beginning. of the the in what's this. uh this is the link. bounding into comics. i don't know it seems dave. chappelle just hasn't been able. to catch a break following a recent. netflix special last year. i mean honestly dude. you know he made so many tens. of millions of dollars. but still like i i hate that. shame dude i hate when people [ __ ] shame people um but like and you know he's doing fine i think but like um they apparently they put out a somebody signed there was a petition and 882. people signed it and that. was what did it 120. 120 128 i'm dyslexic. yes 128. dude that's not even. i thought i mean either way. it's 128 people signed. this [ __ ] petition and they canceled. the show more people were going. to beat the show that's unreal. to let this the fact that 128 people signed. the petition which means if there. was going to even be a protest. it would be way. less than that which means the people in the pro. because never anytime there's like some sort of protest there's always like the people that actually care and then there's like not everybody. actually cares some people go. because it's a thing to. do you know like you can't. tell me that every white chick. that joined the black lives matter. protest [ __ ] actually gave a [ __ ] they just wanted to. go and take an instagram picture. of it you know. what i mean and that's real [ __ ] period. okay i'm not saying it's not a noble. cause i'm not saying it. is risen i have no [ __ ] idea about black lives matter. i have zero idea i have no. idea if that lady bought a house. with the funding six million. dollars i have no idea that's what the press. said but i have no [ __ ] idea because we don't what trust suppress we don't know we don't know. [ __ ] about it and i'm not black so i have no [ __ ] idea i'm barely white so um so my point is people like so they took the show away they're letting these fringe people who who are doing this protesting dictate because they think their bags are gonna get [ __ ] taken i guess but boy did they fumble the bag dude and i don't use that kind of slick talk but boy did they man they just [ __ ] did another theater it's like dude it's a whole. thing if you can't beat them. join them just let them. [ __ ] play let them talk people acting like this is like violence. towards trans people what dave chappelle. says [ __ ] off man you know what's violence violence. i'm so it's so annoying. oh this makes people die. dude i tweeted something about [ __ ] this was years ago. about uh pit bulls about how like you never read. any [ __ ] articles about like uh uh uh whatever the [ __ ] dogs are uh havanese is killing anyone and then i said that but that's what pit boy pitbull owners always [ __ ] going to. bat for people saying that they're the sweetest. [ __ ] dogs but you never see what the [ __ ] tweet was and like dude whitney cummings called me crying and [ __ ] like you're leading this is leading the [ __ ] people uh pit bulls dying pipples are gonna [ __ ] die. because of this tweet and i'm just like ow so i she used. to be my friend so i took the [ __ ] tweet down and it's like violence is violence. dude stop acting like i'm out there. with a [ __ ] ak47 about to. shoot a goddamn pitbull because i tweeted. about how pitbull's [ __ ] take legs off of [ __ ] kids and yeah you know what if havenesses were bigger they'd probably do it too i don't [ __ ] know man they were bred that way i don't even give a [ __ ] dude i don't even give a [ __ ] man violence. is violence it's so annoying. when people think that because of what dave chappelle. said that some group of people. are now just like in the fire. at the end of a firing squad. anyway dude this episode is definitely getting [ __ ] age. restricted and demonetized but whatever the [ __ ] man it's like it's enough already dude enough. man wear the dress cut your hair who gives a [ __ ] i don't give a [ __ ] do it um i do also think that you know he's like a dog with a bone on the other side it's like now he's just trolling right. like now it's like you made your point. and now you're just trolling. uh but it's [ __ ] funny though. you're not gonna convince people. it's not funny dave chappelle. is [ __ ] hilarious and you're not going to. convince people are always going to. see them you know why. capitalism they're going to keep going. to see them dude. he's going to keep making people. money and he's going to. keep making money and people aren't going. to stop you are fighting. a [ __ ] losing battle. if you want equal rights. i get it dude. you know but i i think you have them. or do you i don't know. i guess they're trying to. overturn the [ __ ] some supreme court. justices like they don't want gay. people to marry and stuff. i don't really know i'm too. dumb to know any of that.
