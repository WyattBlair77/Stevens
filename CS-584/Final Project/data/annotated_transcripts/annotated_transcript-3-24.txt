guy. i'm not a fat guy. i'm not even close. to the fact i'm joking but honestly. i just feel like maybe it'll just be more. fun you know like maybe it'll just be more. fun maybe i'll just eat pasta. and ice cream and pizza and you know i because the thing. is in the daytime dude. i got no problem eating. healthy the worst i'll do is a turkey. sandwich and that's the worst. okay but mostly salads stuff. without bread in it maybe some quinoa. a little dash of quinoa. um and then uh when night comes all hell breaks. loose dude all hell breaks. loose my babies that's it. hey time for hell to. go like this i got the keys. hell's got the keys. at night hell's got the keys. dude hell hell. goes like this there's ice cream out. there [music] how it goes like this. wait there's pizza out there. hell goes oh it's it's thin. crust then i can eat double. hell goes pizza and ice. creams out there holla. hey guard come here. good guard against the bars. huh always wanted to. do that hey guard come here. come on into. the thing that's a that's a real badass. move dude and then kiss them. um but yeah dude. uh uh so yeah i don't know. man i just i maybe i'll just be a fat guy. at some point i don't know sometimes. i see people and they got older. and i haven't seen them. in a long time. and they're just fat and i'm like you know. what i'm like i'm i don't i guess. some people are like well you look like [ __ ] i'm just like dude. maybe you figured it out. like how much does. how much is this cancer. you're getting worth it worth 10. years i don't know i mean. some people just see 85 and they're like you know. hello sometimes you people who are not 70. and they're just like hey but sometimes people 75. are jumping off desks and [ __ ] you ever see jack lalanne i think he's still alive. he's 150. um but yeah man. you know eating leaves. how much fun are you. having you you put too much. dressing on you get a diet. cancer anyway so it's just like you know maybe i just want to. be a fat guy. or just like a an out. of shape guy you know i don't know man you know i like to. keep it lean but also ice cream so good and then also it's just like watching everything on like hulu and amazon and amazon prime and hbo max. and and netflix it's just like dude. maybe i'll just maybe i'll just maybe i'll just give hell the keys. because there's so many things on like i watched. that watcher show and then i watched. i was done watching the watcher. show and then i watched just so many like like even kristen. the other day was like let's go. see lyle crocodile with calvin. and i was like yes dude that sounds like such a nice. family outing but then all of a sudden i was like think of all the couch sitting i won't be doing think about that. think about all the food. and i don't mean popcorn. i mean actual food. i won't because i like to. be comfortable just like the next. person but when you get too comfortable. involved when you get the couch sitting watching that's three. comfortables involved the couch sitting chilling. watching a tv show or a movie. chilling and then also putting food. in your mouth chilling that's three. comfortables right so the more comfortable. is involved you can't have too. many comfortables right you. definitely can't have too. many comfortable like if you're on the couch eating. watching the thing and somebody's giving you an otp. hj not good too. many comfortables right i would. argue that that's not even a comfortable. that's a pleasurable you can't do a pleasure. feeding eating is a little bit. of a pleasurable but it's more comfortable. if you couple it with right. watching a tv show and then also setting an account. couch that's too comfortables. and that pleasurable turns into. a comfortable right but if you add a note. to phj absolute too much. that's that's too pleasurables that now. connect each other and become a bigger. pleasurable so that's really too comfortables. and too pleasurables and they cancel each other. out you might as well be standing in the middle of a field. right but my point. is you know you link. these comfortables up you. feel real nice you. link these pleasurables up it's too. much it's distracting it's like that. guy who always was having orgasms. what that what's that condition. where the guy just can't. stop having orgasms and he'll just be like and he told the press. and the press was. like so what's it like and he was like well you know. i just sit and uh you know. it's it happens every few seconds. and if i'm lucky it'll happen. every minute uh but yeah i just can't. i simply cannot and you're just like sitting there like that's too. many pleasurables right like you wouldn't want. an orgasm all the time but um anyway dude. so we went to. go see lilac crocodile. i the here's the thing okay. we saw lala crocodile. i thought it was going. to be absolutely bonkers. because i'm gonna go group. with cap but because i was like because i was like i'm missing. out on couch setting time but like let's do this. for the sun because i want calvin. to have a happy life. and i don't want to. see crocodile but he wants. to see a lot. of crocodile and what does. that make me do makes me. want to kind of see. la la crocodile because i want to. share the experience with them. right now i don't live for myself. i live for someone. outside of me never thought. that would have happened in 2016. yet. here i am but the couch. sitting time right and i can still kind of get couch. sitting time with calvin but she's like but let's go. and i'm like what about the couch. setting time but then she's like i pick. movie theaters and i'm like oh she wants to. lay down get a blanket. and press a button and have the waiter. come during the whole movie. but do they have but do they have pretzels with with cheese. yes they do yes they do but do they have chicken tacos. yes they do oh yes they do they have pizza that. they make yes they do dude. the ipic theaters you. can go to a movie. and be in either big be an even bigger fat. slot than go to. amc you could literally chillax dude. and i'm just like i don't even know. how much it is it's probably. it's you know it's it's like a whole date. night if you're gonna go. but i went with kristen. and calvin and we went to. go see a lot of crocodile. first of all there's a book. called the la crocodile that. i read actually that was one. of those books that i skipped over. even when i was a kid. i've seen it but i skipped over. it right but when lilac crocodile. came to the movie. i was like oh i remember this. [ __ ] but then i'm like why don't they just call it lyle the crocodile. as a movie like it's cute. for a book but for a movie. with javi bardem so i'm like let's watch this. movie who's in it that constance woo. woman who you know. and also the skeeter mcdeeter or whatever. the hell his name. is scoop mcnary right good. actor so i'm like let's go see. lala crocodile then uh. we get there and calvin is so excited. at the ipic theater he sits. down he's waiting and and dude. this little kid comes on the the before. the movie preview and he's eating a hamburger talk. about all the food. at i pick calvin sees. the kitty can't stop laughing. at the kid we're eating a hamburger. dude he's just laughing. at the kitty the hamburger. so i'm like this could be great. dude he's about to. see a singing crocodile. he's going to have the time. of his life he killed it. at super pets he killed. it at bad guys he killed it. at saying two the dude. was locked in like he was ready. for ready to test. gforces i mean my son. watched movies the whole time. like he was ready to. test gforces and i don't mean. he was like testing gforces. i mean he was ready. like okay guys anything could happen here i might pass. out i might have the time of my life. and i might celebrate afterwards. but here we go that's how my son. was watching these movies. super pets bad guys and also sing. too now i wasn't there. for sync two that was his first movie because it kind of snuck it on. me felt bad that i didn't go. to his first movie so she left. the theater and then we went to. go see bad guys all good i want. to be there for every one of my sons first. is that feasible no but i want to. be but he wants to. be right i want to. be there for every one of my sons first. why because i'm such a [ __ ] good dad and i had no. idea i would be yet. i am yeah here i am. five years later out. the flames loving the [ __ ] out. of my son and my family. that's how locking back up. and going you know i'll stay. in here for a bit um so yeah. la la crocodile starts and um you. know i don't want to. do like a review of lyle lyle crocodile. because this is a podcast. for adults right um but uh sucks. donkey ball sucks donkey balls. sucks donkey balls and um even for a kids. movie it makes sense these kids movies. dude for real they don't have to. make sense but but but hey hey though hey though. also do me a favor. right hey guys you can make it make sense. you know how i know the english. patient is a movie. okay so just do a kid. version of it making sense. of that it doesn't have. to make sense because my son. will watch blippi it doesn't have to. make sense because my son. will watch b b this is the letter. b [ __ ] song i i this is the letter i uh uh igloo w w. this is the letter w. why is this my career. wha why is my life. my wife leaving me i'll do it. that's a killing that. that song rips for real. dude you'll be singing. it later on your kid. watching it and he's just like liking. it you're like this is [ __ ] and then later on at the bank. you're just like [ __ ] jay just here to. make a deposit so uh but my point. is universal touchstone doesn't even. exist anymore columbia pictures orion do me. fave pixar seems to. have a handle on it. thanks but do me. fave if you're making a lot of crocodile. i get my kiddo just watch literally a crocodile. singing and dancing but you know. what though dude movie hey hollywood do me. fave okay because honestly i'm sitting there. and i'm like jesus christ. now what do all of the movies. that calvin have seen have in common. super bets bad guys sing two. animation what does this one. not have one of these things is not like the other lilac. crocodile live anime live uh. live action so we're watching it. and i'm noticing calvin watches. it for a little bit and then gets restless. why because nobody is literally a cartoon singing. in his face do you like mushrooms. do you like mushrooms yes i do do you like popsicles. yes i do do you like mushroom. popsicles yucky no i don't. so now my son not only has to. see a crocodile singing. and dancing he's also got to. see an actual real life. constance woo say well we can't. tell your father he's got to. see javi bardem he's got to. see 60 year old javi b over there. like this is going to. make me lots of money. right and my son doesn't care how many colors javi bees got on he's sitting there like where's the mushroom popsicle. so now not only is he you. know doing tumbles in his seat. all laid back not. only is he running around. throwing the chicken fingers that we got from ipic. and the ranch sauce only. dipping fingers in his not even eating the chicken right not only is he doing that but i'm sitting there and i'm like hollywood's doing me no favors by just having this crocodile not taught the crackers i can't talk you can only sing dude if you can sing you can talk right if you can sing just do the easier version of that and do it or if you can sing how about you like she'd ask him like what's going on today and he would just be like and then when she needed help with cooking he was like you grab the spatula and then you just did the pancakes it's like dude you can sing how you are today too dude just sing everything be like james corden he [ __ ] doesn't he sing like i feel like james corden sings 65 of the [ __ ] that comes out of his mouth so it's just like i'm sitting there and hollywood's doing me no favors and [ __ ] calvin. sitting there rolling around. throwing [ __ ] cheese fries and [ __ ] lila loud crocodile is an abomination of a movie. all right and i mean that. also even as like a who's it. for who is it for is. my question super pets yes. sing two uh bad guys the bad. guys with the [ __ ] fox and the snake. and [ __ ] that's for kids. because they get to. get my sons too he's locked in. i told you lala crocodile. where the crocodile only. sings and there's only one crocodile. in it and the rest is live action and it's like who's that. for my twoyearold's all over. the place is a nineyearold gonna want to. watch that no in nine years. gonna want to. watch hawkeye dude foreign god. it's so much better

watching this movie and i'm just like it's bad the acting is bad the [ __ ] which means the directing is bad if all of the actors are bad the director is bad if all of the actors are good the director is good period that's how it is okay javi b shows up dude all right javier bardem javibe shows up dude now javi b shows up in a [ __ ] outfit that would make like charlie and the chocolate factory go like you're wearing that all right [ __ ] willy wonka javibe shows up dude and this guy and i'm not this is not a joke dude he arrests you you're in the theater and he arrests you dude you go where are we going because i'm on a ride dude he's so good in this movie and then i realize javi b is one of the most absolute greatest actor greatest actors of our time because i'm sitting here watching javi b and his florida gators shirt and hat with the [ __ ] pubes coming out the sides right pretending he's hanging with a crocodile because it's not real but he's i mean this guy is just like doing all sorts of oh you know dancing and grabbing his hand and twisting with the [ __ ] big ass crocodile laughing like [ __ ] is really funny i mean this dude's on another level man and i'm watching this and then i'm like and i i actually have a thought wait a minute hold on i thought this guy was in no country for old men but maybe he isn't because this guy's different i had to google it afterwards for those of you that don't know if it is or it is it is him he completely envelops the character javi b it goes like this dude christian bale let me tell you something dude there are actors that cannot people i'm gonna point i'm gonna. name three actors that do things. that actors just can't do all. right there's not many of them. there are more than who i'm saying. but these are the three that come to. mind all right christian. bale sean penn daniel daylewis. and javi now let me tell you what. when i say javi because here's the thing. those three actors can do things. that nobody can do javi b main. like there's a guy who can do what. javi b did in um la la crocodile. like you know nathan lane. or [ __ ] you know uh the guy from will and grace the the the the really flamboyant one. that dude would kill but could he be. in no country for old men no. dude imagine nathan lane. in no country for old men with the [ __ ] like shooting the cow in the head with the [ __ ] well it's time to. die how pain you know. but dude the range though. but that range that javi b has that range that javier bardem goes like i would like to. play lilac crocodile. that range but and then it goes. are you sure you were no. country for old men and he goes like this. watch how i show up happy. as [ __ ] pubes coming out the side of the [ __ ] top hat florida gator shirt. on suspenders all the way. up just like where is. the crocodile it doesn't matter. it's not here i will still. have a good time. i pretend like it is. here his [ __ ] is phenomenal. dude i am telling you. right now and this is no joke. he deserves to. get nominated for an oscar. for lala crocodile along and i don't. think he should win i think austin. butler should win but he should be i mean dude i haven't seen all the movies i get it. and everyone's talking about oh like this. and that the other thing. and this movie is good. like somebody wants me to. see kate blanchett and [ __ ] tar. and i'm just like past dude. you know pass that movie. is so full of itself. i can tell by the preview i'm sure she's great. also that's a different best. female performance but you know. my god javi b that guy's one. of my favorite actors now and i was sitting now i'm watch. and when javi javier shows up the wall. according i'm like this. okay good good thank god i mean. this guy hollywood do i mean. no favor but boy are the [ __ ] this spaniard comes in and he's just [ __ ] saving the day i love javier bardem and i don't mean to. make this whole podcast. about javier bardem but sexy is all get out. i mean come on dude. at least sean boy when sean penn played i am sam. i go like this this guy you know. how christian bale loses weight. or gains weight and does that [ __ ] remember we need advice and he played uh what's his name the vice. president what was his name dick. cheney played dick cheney. and he just cursed about. just like great i'll just say pizza. and hot dogs i mean. he was giving hell the keys. for that no doubt dude. and he just plumped the [ __ ] up and he probably pulled his hair. out too same for the american. hustle but then he got really skinny. for the machine machinist and they got really skinny. and then beefed up. right afterward for batman i mean. dude what christian bale does. with his weight honestly for acting i swear. to god sean penn. did with down syndrome and i am. sam that dude got it for three. months he [ __ ] got it for three months if you watch dude look at this. here's how you know. if somebody's a good actor or not google. a still image of them. in a character ah dude. google is still image google is still image of the person. in the in the movie i'll put a still i'm gonna put a still image of somebody. writing of sean penn right. here in i am sam. it's gonna be right here i haven't get rid of gonna do it. look at that look at that. image dude and the oscar. for best still image goes to. sean penn and i am. sam this is sean penn's first still image oscar. for playing a downside look. at that picture he obviously. has has incredible strength and a big head. great we'll get [ __ ] flagged for that. but you know what i mean. dude you know what i'm saying. it's a comedy podcast. we already can't [ __ ] get it. gang what's up with the subscribers youtube. it's because we got caught. in the name or whatever. whatever do we write. it out you can't keep us. down [music] and the and the award. for oscar for best still image this. year goes to. javi b for lyle lyle crocodile. him with the suspenders like this. and you get it. dude if

just kind of gardens it is it was like one of the only things right besides you unless you want to. go to a pumpkin. patch but those are all closed. at [ __ ] nine so she's like i got tickets. to go from nine to. ten so i'm like what is this. gonzo gardens what is this halloween. thing and she says i don't know. and i said well you looked it. up right and she's like yeah it's like they got like you know halloween stuff. and i was like so but what is it. and she says oh i i i i i don't know. and she says stop asking me i don't. really know and i said well we're going we should know. what it is anyway. we didn't it wasn't like an argument. but i'm like whatever and then so i said calvin. will go ask mommy what. it is so she'll answer. you because she won't answer. me and she goes and it was a little second moment. but it's all good so we went to. descanso gardens and our tickets were from nine to. ten i don't know why you had tickets. but you just i guess it would get overcrowded. and let me tell you something. dude my son had such an uncle blast. dude he saw so many pumpkins man. there were so many freaking pumpkins. so many beautiful pumpkins that they carved you know. they had like a um but i had like a moment. there that was totally unexpected that i was blindsided. from we get to. this kind of gardens. and we're walking around a little bit. my my son's saying like you know. i got pumpkin pants on. and he does they're glow in the dark. i got a pumpkin. shirt on she's another girl with a pumpkin. shirt on he says to. her i got a pumpkin. shirt on it's cool. it's called carved is. what it is at uh uh verdugo. i keep saying jesus. descanso gardens verdugo hospitals. right next to. it and don't know why. i keep doing that but um so we are walking. through it and the this. kind of gardens is like this. really big setup area. that's also it i mean. it's like there's stuff that's built in it. like like like benches and like a small outdoor stage and then there's like you know um like stuff that's like obviously planted like a bit of flowers and there's a huge beautiful. tree that if you chopped it. down you'd probably get like [ __ ] 90. years in prison and uh and uh it's it's just like there's like lights. and stuff that are put up. and they really deck. it out for halloween though. and there's like i mean i'm talking about. if there's if there's a hundred pumpkins there's there's got to. be 800 pumpkins lit up. like jackolanterns i mean right. some of them are carved in like with like movies. like they got a batman. one they got a [ __ ] you know encanto one for kids. and [ __ ] my son's looking at the minions. one uh uh and uh i'm walking. with calvin and my calvin's. just having a blast i mean. he's really visual. it's not like a lot. of crocodiles like he's [ __ ] arrested. watching sing too like really. locked in like about to. go for that geforce testing and he looks at these. benches almost like pews and this outdoor stage and there's this big skeleton on this. outdoor stage and uh candles and all this [ __ ] lit up for halloween and calvin looks at it and he walks towards it and he keeps saying what what he takes. four or five steps and he says what. look at this skeleton what and it's hysterical. okay because i'm his dad. it's it's honestly not that crazy. but it's blowing his [ __ ] mind or he's seen me. do this about something and now he's just recreating it. i don't know either way. it's hilarious and we're passing these. pews he walks all the way. up to the skeleton and he's just saying what. what and i'm sitting next to. him looking at him. right up at the skeleton and then i i don't actually look at the skeleton because my whole. thing is when i'm watching a movie. with my son or we're experiencing something. new i don't watch the thing. i watch my son because i want to. although experience this with him. i really want to. take in how much he loves and is experiencing. this new thing so i'm looking at him. and kristen is standing behind me. and i realize her energy changes. and it's not a big thing. but it's like a very small minute. thing that i think honestly only i could probably feel because i'm her. husband and she puts her hand on calvin's. shoulder and then i look up at the skeleton and it's got a bunch of pictures of children. on it with candles and i realize that. these are children. that have passed away and kristen says okay. calvin come over here. and we go to. sit down on the bench. to i guess you know pay. our respects you know. i didn't realize it was just it. was odd because calvin's saying what what and there's comedy. in that but there was also a very weighty sadness. that i wasn't even aware. of until i was aware. of it and calvin was never aware. of it and um we sit on. the bench and calvin sitting. with me and i'm i'm just hit with like. this very um strong mix of feelings. of how of how lucky i am. that i have this and how sad. this is um and how i'm well aware. of this and calvin isn't to. me it's to. him it's just this big. skeleton that's just incredulous and calvin. walks away with kristen and i sit there and i just start [ __ ] crying dude like it all hit me about how like just blindsided me. about how sad. this is that this is the reality. that we live in and i'm so fortunate and you're so fortunate to. live every day with somebody that. you love because that could be just [ __ ] ripped from you. and at any moment. and so we did that and that was kind of in the beginning. of of uh of uh the descanso. gardens thing and you know it's like when i say life rips. it's like those are the moments. where you really have to. [ __ ] take that in um and then we leave at the end of it we were there. for about an hour. and we leave and then we drive home. kristen goes to. bed a little later and calvin. i we put him down and and i went downstairs. and i just started thinking about these children. and these families of these children. uh you know this is uh after i watched. the movie till death. with megan fox uh it really. has no bearing on it. just kind of like the just kind of [ __ ] them give the big. idiot i am you know. what i mean just watching a [ __ ] megan fox. movie because it's on netflix. and i'm just and i just go oh give it a try. and uh after this movie i just i'm just sitting and i'm like should i eat something. i start thinking about these children. and um i just i get so sad. and i and i start crying again. like um because i i i i i i realize i'm i i live in uh i'm i'm i have this. fear of um of this. world being so chaotic. and i have this fear of like being a father. and a parent in this. world when there's so much craziness out there. and i start panicking and i had a i would say a panic. attack not a fullblown i've had bad. panic attacks before. a few a couple uh but this one. was right up there i mean. i i started crying and like i couldn't understand. why i i i i i should feel fortunate you know. and i was just i was literally crying. because i was scared. which i don't think i've ever. done before unless i you know on since. i was calvin's age um and it was just a really. weird unique experience and um i i you know. i cried for like [ __ ] 30 minutes. and then i went to. bed and i couldn't fall asleep. and i finally fell asleep. i was just like i hope. that i wake up tomorrow. and i feel okay and i woke up the next morning. and i felt better but not all. better and then that's today um and i kept thinking how am. i gonna do this podcast. but um i did i just you know. and i think it's going. well and it's fun you know had a lot. of interesting things to. say about javier bardem but and and and and and and quartile but uh it's just like real life. [ __ ] keeps happening dude that's the craziest thing. you know when i was in before. i was really like in in therapy. and really dealing with like my my self. and my emotions and [ __ ] and just kind of living uh for pleasure. uh and selfishly um i would have never thought. about this [ __ ] and now that i do it's so [ __ ] uncomfortable for me um but like i also i also had therapy today and it was brutal. like i was like really like emotional. during the therapy and then afterwards. i felt a little better. i feel a little better. now um i don't know man. i don't even know what i'm trying. to say it's just like [ __ ] i mean we deal with all these emotions as people and like even as like a funny we're having a great. time and then a sad. time and then a [ __ ] another good time it's like even in this. podcast like you know this podcast. used to be [ __ ] silly. goose times strictly and now. it's silly goose times [ __ ] absolutely 75 of the time. but every now and then i gotta tell you how i'm feeling. dude and i gotta tell you how i'm feeling. because like uh i don't owe it. to anybody but i just want to. i'm 42 and i implore you guys. to [ __ ] do the same man. you know somebody called into. lifeline lifeline my other podcast. here on super call studios and they were talking. about how their husband uh it. won't do therapy and um it's just like i think it's really. beneficial man i was talking to. my tattoo artist the other day. about therapy um i got this the elevator with the heart. in it people you keep asking me. what it means i'll talk about it. one day but it does great. work man huh. does great work man. so now i told him. either i'm like this or like this. in my podcast you'll always see one. of your designs the dude's good um yeah it's a crazy. world out there i did. watch that movie till death. of megan fox dude. and i'm not i like you know. megan fox and machine. gun kelly they're dating and it's super annoying. but um you know i i love. i love machine gun kelly. i love uh uh well i don't know. anything about megan fox right. um except for she's dating. him and she was in transformers. and um and that movie jennifer's. body um and i know nothing about her. at all and uh i'm always annoyed. when two famous people are dating. and i have to. see it all the time. right so uh and so i'm watching this. movie till death i just put it. on and i'm like this. is gonna be [ __ ] shitty just because most. movies are shitty and that's going. to be a safe bet. and then i [ __ ] i'm gonna start watching it dude. you know megan fox is a good. actress she's good she this. movie was a fine movie. no it was a fine. script and the way. that it was directed and the way. that megan fox did it. tonally she elevated the [ __ ] project dude. congratulations to [ __ ] megan fox. for real she's good she was [ __ ] good dude in this movie i don't know if that [ __ ] is something to. even talk about but it's just like dude. congrats to her i guess kanye's buying parlor. this guy it's like this. guy just can't stay out of the [ __ ] media. media stop it i guess. it gets clicks this whole. [ __ ] playing parlor because elon musk bought twitter you know kanye west bought to. buy conservative social media. platform parlor because he was locked out. of twitter and instagram. for antisemitic posts who wants. to be this the thing. to me it's like when i when i when a when a white guy. says the nword or like when anybody is. antisymatic antisemitic like freedom is. speech i understand but why. do you want to. say the nword so bad. like it's so easy just just to. not do it yeah but freedom. of speech okay fine but why. though that why who cares. that much if you care so much. about free speech to. that you're like i should be able. to say the nword on twitter. then you're it you may not be racist. but but why do you care. that much so it's like it's picking out. a little bit i get words. are just words but also why like you can absolutely. just say the n word in reference or hey. somebody said this and say it and not be racist. but why do you want to. say it so bad is my point. if i say hey he said the nword. and don't say the n word. and i say the word that doesn't make me racist. but i can easily say the nword. that's the whole thing i don't get about. it it's like he's going. on an antisemitic now. granted i didn't read everything. you said i i saw a few. things it seemed like he was saying. stuff against jews so the fact that he's like [ __ ] that i'm gonna go to. parlor so i can say. this stuff why though maybe look inward. maybe look inward right. we all should look. inward like you can be on parlor. and not be a piece of [ __ ] i don't think that like it's got the media. has this [ __ ] you know biased against parlor. because you know it's got this. whole like you know bigot. connotation which i have no idea. i've never been on it i have no. no idea but like you can be on par. you could get the part. of that be on parlor. and it doesn't mean you're [ __ ] you're a bigot right. um but if you want to. do antisemitic [ __ ] or say the nword. it's super weird you know. like i was kind of gonna feel when the guys. are popping off with the nword on. parlor i'm going to. get parlor uh how big is parlor. is it big how many people are on parlor. i'ma look how many people users on par here we go uh how many people use parlor. 2022 what oh that was 2021. um no. last year it was 32. 000 new downloads. so here earlier 20. maybe so the current stats. of parlor shows that there. are over 16 million registers users registered. users in 2022. earlier in 2012 social media. platform was 20 million for its own. continuation since its return to. the apple store it is oh wow. they went back i didn't know that. it has experienced 32 000. new downloads overall the first 10. days of january saw 870. 000 new years across apple. devices okay so it has so that's so many different. numbers what does it have. you know can you get you i guess. you can't get banned from parlor. um a million active users this. movie that came out in 2017. urban. myths i saw this. the other day and it's just like hi. hi can i help me. i'm looking for that. okay we're watching it okay. he plays bob dylan. pretty cool ben shop and could carry grounds guy. plays samuel beckett all good. fine whatever you guys playing adolf hitler. okay that's fine elizabeth taylor marley. brian cox plays marlon brando hey though joe joe fine plays michael jackson have you seen this yet 2017. dude he plays michael jackson here it's got to. be here i sense. the dangerous [music] sounds. bruce was trying to. kill his monkey through. games what the [ __ ] bro twice i mean just a white guy dude in 2017 i made this movie isn't it crazy how and how much five years have changed who the [ __ ] if they were gonna make a michael jackson movie. they would have to. get a black guy to. do it right which is hilarious. because he's so he's white he's whiter than a white. guy it'll be so much easier to. just get a white guy. and do a little makeup you. know but they'd have to. get a [ __ ] an actual black guy wow. insane and honestly i would argue that that's insane. in the membrane this is the thing. okay so this was anti. antisemitic kanye west tweeted. this i'm a bit sleepy tonight but when i wake up. i'm going defcon 3 on. jewish people in caps. wow the funny thing is i actually can't. be antisemitic because black people. are not are actually jews. so you guys have toyed with me and tried. to blackball anyone who opposes your agenda. dude my favorite part about. this tweet is i'm a bit. sleepy tonight what there's. so many things like you don't like how about how about just don't tweet. this and go defcon. 3 on jewish people tomorrow. you can still do that. like people are going to. be reading that and be like oh well honey it's gonna be hard. to get some sleep. tonight why you see this. kanye tweet he's gonna go death. guess deathcon three on us. also i'm a bit like saying your sleep. what grown man says he's sleepy even you just say. i'm tired i'm a bit sleepy tonight but when i wake up. i'm going defcon 3 on. jewish people what's deathcon 3. um what is that is that like a star. wars thing the death convention. military thing wow not going. military just a rapper. a guy who makes shoes. a guy who's making a guy. who makes two big clothing. death counter i just hey man. you can't sit on twitter. again [music] can't be added to. semitic dude that's the whole. thing i don't think i don't like when people say. white people can't be racist. that's like saying like black people can't. be at this matter dude. why wait wait no sorry. people say you can't be racist. against white people is what they say which is my whole. thing is dude it's got to. stop at the point where if anyone's being judging you. because of the color of you. or something like that you're i don't give a [ __ ] dude. you're racist i don't the history is. bad i get it i get it. it's harder for black people. 100 but dude you can. be racist against white people. period i know that we actually can't be there's people like scholars will be like yes you can't be because i go like this. uh and honestly that makes me. go defcon 3. i would go. death come forward to. that but i don't know. how many death cons. there are but i would do the maximum death. i would go right under the maximum death. count for that if somebody said you couldn't be racist. against me um so that's that let's look. at some of these uh deserve it. scales which really be peak in my interest. you know what i mean. because of how people fall down. and we love it. my son blocked his head the other day. and he almost cried and i hugged him and i said it's gonna be okay it's okay it's okay and it was okay. and you i should take a deep. breath he goes and he didn't he didn't cry. and it was [ __ ] so awesome. he was in the middle. of our crocodile i keep talking. about la la crocodile but you. know what dude we were watching. it and i had to. take him out for a little bit and he said let's go. out there i went out there. and then as soon as we went out. i had to pee i peed. and he said let's go. back into the movie. theater and i was like okay. and he went
