[music] let's see who's back. actually you know i talked about this. guy a long time. ago i can't remember his name. but uh um he talks about having sex. well not sex but like sexual. every anyone would offer would would would say that. this was gay but he's saying it's not gay. it's just men being men and this. guy i talked about him a year ago. maybe more and uh um i think since then he's blown. up because of how crazy and outlandish he is but also i think he was on your mom's. house and there's clips. of him on there i'm pretty sure um and this is his new video. so i just went for run. did some workouts some pushups i'm just pulling. back my forkin and i'm just oh okay. so the matter of fact. is absolutely just unreal. i i sorry i have to. listen to that again. i i i'm sorry so i just went for a run. did some workouts some pushups i'm just pulling. back my forkin and i'm just waving my hummus cannon. around that you know dude. waving my hummus canyon cannon. around first of all started. you don't ever if you have to. say forkin you don't start. it the sentence with so all right. unless you're a doctor so i went for run. did some pushups about hummus. canyon so i for a run did some workouts. some pushups i'm just pulling. back my foreskin and i'm just waving my hummus cannon. around that shroom i'm that shrp now there's a very subtle. pheromonal primal secretion of aprin pheromones underneath the forkin and from the sides. of the glands bro do you hear this. this is a guy that would be on like joe. rogan and then and then he would and then joe rogan. would have him on and then there would be like 40,000 people. that agreed with him and the uh what's it called. the scrot sack and it's really the what's it. called the scrotal sack. interesting because in ancient sparta the men. were constantly working out with their four. skins forward they would wear dude this guy always goes back to ancient sparta he's just like yeah i just went for a run by the way the men in ancient sparta used to suck each other off for um for nutrients this little thing called a kme k y n o d s m which in english means dog tie and it was a string to tie their foreskin forward and then the foreskin underneath would get very very sweaty during the workout during the naked wrestling etc and then they would go and shower together and they would pull back their foreskins and you get this very rank primal masculine pheromonal release from all of the mushrooms in the bath house bro from all of the mushrooms in the bath house that sounds like a movie that like uh uh what's her name would be in um what's her what's her [ __ ] name uh where um hold on i got it no uh daisy edgar jones would be in it is that her yep where the yep that's 100% daisy edgar jones would be in that movie war skins and you get this very rank primal masculine thermona release from all of the mushrooms in the bath house after they wrestled what the freak i put stop it there was a timer going off whoops my bad sorry guys try to limit that sound naked in the gymnasium gymnos means place of male undress gymnos means place of male and also who cares you know hey if the ancient [ __ ] ro if the ancient spartans used to pull their forkins back so they could smell them that's part of history that we don't need to know about you know dude you know why because i wouldn't need to know if my friends were doing that how about that if i don't need to know if my friends were doing it i don't need to know about it in history okay i sure i need to know if there was genocide i need to know if you know uh uh there was uh uh a killing of a queen or a king i don't care if spartans tied up their foreskin and got them all sweaty and then pulled back their foreskin to expose their mushrooms to smell rankness i don't need to know that and so i find it really interesting men are really missing out on that aspect like there are you know hockey dudes who get naked they. pull back their forkins and they'll shoot. their hummus onto a. cookie sorry what there there. are who are these hockey dudes. but it's always done in the dark. in a sense of like in shame. and and secrecy let's bring these rituals back. into the light back into. the sun let's get those mushrooms. out and sniff sniff sniff and bring in 5d. right we need to. activate the pheromones into the olfactory sense. dude it's so uh the internet. is not it shouldn't. have been made you know. like it shouldn't have been like it's not this. guy that is the problem this. guy's great he's great it's a guy. that he will influence to. take his mushroom out in like a [ __ ] outside of shoppr right on the patio just like i'm getting vitamin [music] d so i just went for it is weird that people will just talk about everything online i mean i look i have a podcast this has almost been 400 hours of this podcast and i've also done a lot of other podcasts i've said some crazy [ __ ] but that to. believe it and say that. and to believe it. is absolutely bonkers but what the [ __ ] do i know man. he's like why don't we need. to bring those ancient. rituals back no we evolved past. that we a we evolved also it. didn't happen i'm sorry. i know there are some weird. things that go on in throughout history maybe maybe i could imagine a world. where you're like you have to. wrestle with guys so you tie. up your penis because of a weird. kind of you know the you know. back then they thought the devil. walked among them and like. you know there were oh people still do i guess. but like then they got well now you you have to. untie the shaft and take a shower. if i even showered but what. a trip man don't do that. huh ew how about this. ew h what a deviant. see out there to. smile now listen carefully to. the off camera voice that has to. tell her to smile. honey nancy car what's this for nc caran so over. it to most of the stations. across the country that are eager. to hear about him. we have an attitude. problem here during a parade. do we have an attitude. problem here carrian complained to. mickey mouse it's so corny so dumb. i hate it the most. corny thing i've ever done. she says it's so corny to. mickey mouse look at him. looking at her just [music]. waving this is the most corny. thing i've ever done. and says saying it to. mickey mouse hey also it's a parade. all parades are corny as [ __ ] and did she won a medal right. for skating and you know. it's like i guess you could you're you're you're allowed. to be in a bad. mood but also now it kind of explains. why your [ __ ] kneecap. got bashed in you know. and i'm not trying to. be a dick but like we get we you know. it's like look everyone's this. is the thing about victims it's like at some point. you got to be like look you got your knee bashed. in and that sucks yes 100% shouldn't have happened. but maybe you shouldn't pit.

[ __ ] and i was like man this movie is just i say it's just great. and she says it is and i was like yeah. because i told her what it. was about and i was like it's it. doesn't you can make anything good. you can make any movie good this. is why i don't understand. that they make like top. priced big budget expensive. actors uh paid pay writers millions of dollars. to make this absolute horeshit. hollywood is so they make time. and time again horrible. movies but for them. to make some a very simple. movie with a simple story with no. real moments where it's like oh it's just straightforward. about about about a a dad. trying to get his locket. back you know and it's really good dude. the first of all the gore is. crazy and i'm not a gore. guy i don't care if something's gory but the way. they did it i don't even. know how they did it. it looks so real they kill. one guy with like a uh it's like this. drawn out scene with like a a log splitter and they just like the killer. just puts a guy's head on it. and he and he just cuts. his head off and i'm just like that's real. life that's uh really documented they. did that i don't understand. like ai and this wasn't ai. but the fact that special effects. can be that good like it's one. thing to have um you know. cyclops ibeam uh an air a spacecraft cuz you don't. really know what that looks like you. know in real life you don't know. you can't really imagine what that. would look a a a a pegasus. on fire flying in from venus. you don't know what that. looks like okay you you know. but you kind of can gather. based on all of the other uh things you've seen in your life. what it might be like for somebody's head. to get lopped off by a a log splitter and i'll tell you dude. i' be damned they nailed it. so it's like they can do that. you got to see this. movie dude i'm watching this.
