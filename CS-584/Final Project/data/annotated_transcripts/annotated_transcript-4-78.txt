some dates on this. followtheleader tour for [music]. for a san diego put up. one sold out very quickly. put up another one. sold out very quickly. put up a third one. sold out not as quickly. but still even before. the show started all good. okay now i was ready. i was ready dude i was ready. for some [ __ ] combat comedy you know what i'm talking about and i don't like combat comedy. a lot of

anybody large or small male/female. don't care i don't even. care if you have disabilities everyone gets. equal slams it doesn't matter you all feel. like a person if you're gonna [ __ ] you know what i mean step into. the octagon now you're gonna get a denny's. grand slam if you [ __ ] so i'm ready for some comic holly i don't like a lot people think i do because they do it i take it to. the [ __ ] streets of twitter i take it to. the streets that you know. i'm i laughed laugh actor youtube. people are heckerling heckling and you got the videos. and i'm just [ __ ] talking [ __ ] people think i like that i've weaned it out over the time because i have netflix specials in a [ __ ] comedy central special and people think that now that okay he's actually legit comedian it doesn't do although only a clap acts but that i'm ready to. take it to. the streets at twitter but i did. not want to i'm like one. of those [ __ ] syrup i'm like one of those serial killers that's just like i don't want. to do it you know. but i have to. no not even that like a hit man. i don't want to. do that but i need to. feed my family the feeding. the family in this. case is me showing people. what's up that's the most for a thing. for me showing people what's up. people say chris but don't be mean. but i say but look you need to. know right they said but chris don't take him. to the streets of twitter but i say but he needs. to know but he didn't tag. you that's right because i searched my name but isn't that petty i don't think so i think more. of it is that he needs. to know you understand. if this is the internet and this is what the internet. is then that [ __ ] needs to. know what this internet is so that's it. okay somebody did it just right. now it's a parking somebody. tweeted something i just lamps whatever it doesn't matter dude my point is i was all ready for some combat comedy first show went off without a hitch. second show went off without a hitch. third show went out now. i throw a guy out. but it was still not so bad. for san diego it was fine. did i throw out a guy. yes did i do it. very quickly yes did i do it. in the part of my act where i the only place. i could do it yes. did the [ __ ] security escort him out. yes did he [ __ ] throw down a trash. can in the lobby when he was escorted. out yes did he try and fight the security. yes did they call the cops. yes did the cops come yes did. they put him in handcuffs. yes did his girl try and kick the cops. and then the cops slammed. the girl to the ground. yes is that san diego yes but still once. in the three shows in that bag. so san diego i've come around. dude dude i've come around. man i had a good i had good three. shows now one guy that was surely. stockier than he is tall and had a backwards. [ __ ] hurley hat surely. and had a flannel. buttoned up all the way to. his [ __ ] neck surely and a girl with a group with a body that does it. isn't that good but isn't pretty passable for not working. out surely was trying to. ruin it but that the cops. come and do a [ __ ] osoto. gari and put her on the ground. and cuff him up and put him in the [ __ ] drunk. tech yes so san diego. i'm coming around dude. still to those people but also sad. i've come around i'm a morning. dj my babies i got a [ __ ] keyboard dude. and i use it. but that's it dude. so i had a good time. so san diego dude. i stayed at the [ __ ] penury hotel. and usually when i go. into [ __ ] a town you know in my head i'm like don't talk to. me when i check in i don't want people saying [ __ ] i don't want to. [ __ ] id you know i don't like to. be bothered with fans i like them. when they like me from afar. i don't like them number. one staring if you look at me. dance the way if you see. the 50 cent sign what's the 50 cent line. if you see be a public. don't stare be mine whatever the [ __ ] it is i don't know whatever the [ __ ] it is i used to. think that was weird. but now i get it. because almost famous is 50. cent so so i see it i don't like to. be doing this [ __ ] but then when they say when was i saying so what are they saying. then they get yeah so but secretly i'm ready. for it wasn't happening. so much in san diego. i was i guess because i'm close. to la and it wasn't because i was close. to la it was because i wasn't even. close to the most famous. person staying at the hotel. because it was the san diego. international film festival now why do they call it. the san diego international. film festival when it's [ __ ] 30 minutes. away from la it doesn't need to. say it's international even though. it is international because you they accept. [ __ ] movies from all over the place. i get it but don't say it. trying to make you [ __ ] sound better. it doesn't matter is it. very sandy aegon yes. but i was in the elevator and i saw the guy. from [ __ ] chernobyl and i told my dad i saw the guy for the lead from chernobyl. and he said oh which one from chernobyl. and i said the [ __ ] goddamn lead. and he said well which one is that and i said did. you see it and he said yes and i said well then the guy who is in it. the most and then he said oh and they said the guy's name. and i didn't know what his name. was and my mom said yeah. and that whole conversation. is interesting because it didn't need. to happen denis tan my dad's the king of that. [ __ ] dude yeah i saw the leader noble. and the in an elevator oh which one is the lead. well you're a [ __ ] director and a producer in hollywood so you surely. know what a lead is right. well yeah but which one was it. well did you see the show. while i only saw the first three episodes. okay so the guy that was in those episodes. the most then he said the guys. named jared harris and then i said yes. conversation over did we need to. have it no people need to. get their [ __ ] together but i did that too like father like son the apple doesn't fall far. from the tree and it's not my fault. did his dad vincent do it. probably i don't know but did. [ __ ] my grandpa everyone called him isn't him i we called him grandpa. bam everyone called him bam. because when he was a kid. he was skinny as a bamboo stick but he wasn't skinny. when he was older so it was always confusing. for me as a kid. my grandpa bam anyway. it's a [ __ ] new york in the fifth [ __ ] 30s. to be an in vincent but also go. by bam you know what i mean. like that old [ __ ] like the old [ __ ] like hey bam yeah don't call me that my name is vincent yeah you're skinny like a bamboo stick yeah whatever i don't want to. be called bam it. doesn't matter and it's stuck. and it kept sticking and then just a montage of him. growing up hey get in fights. [ __ ] and [ __ ] hey dylan and that's where i was that's where i was everyone knew me as bam you know it kind of grew on me than just him [ __ ] dealing drugs so anyway damn my grandpa bam so whatever the [ __ ] dude so anyway what i'm trying to. say is san diego i've come around. but uh it's all good. and i was in riverside. everyone always talks about look when you say you're going. to riverside everyone always talks about how riverside they're like oh man you stay in the night i hope not dude. it [ __ ] ripped i did riverside i loved performing. in riverside stayed the night. in riverside okay i stayed the night. in riverside man that's an hour. and a half away. i stayed the night. dude do you understand. me and i stayed in a hotel. that was not good fine. now did by the way. there was some kind of [ __ ] [ __ ] parade in riverside or something and it really pissed me off i woke up it woke me up in the morning. i heard people go like boom. little uluru and then i was like i'm saying. am i dreaming this. and then they just heard coming closer. closer and then i just kept hearing. blue and i was like [ __ ] riverside dude it does suck man. but then i woke up and there was just some i don't know what [ __ ] parade. was going on on saturday. or friday or what was it. i guess it was friday. morning who the [ __ ] has a parade on friday morning. riverside that was the best they could get they were like can we get a saturday or sunday parade and they were like nice riverside. man parade they're moving they get to. san diego in la by. by [ __ ] it's saturday and sunday all right. let's just do it friday. and then so they did their parade. i don't even know if there. was a parade i just kept [ __ ] waking up by the time. i woke up woke up it. was it was done. it wasn't really a pretty. but definite was a parade. though it was like just people marching around. and [ __ ] but then i went outside. and i got some coffee that. was good and i got a breakfast. sandwich that was good there was a coffee. bean and tea leaf. right there there's cute little town dude. i feel like riverside is. on the come up man. but had a good time. in riverside the crowds are always good. in riverside i don't know why people are always like yeah but that's because they don't have anything to. do bro they look like they're doing just fine. also some places that don't have anything. to do their crowds suck. like in north battleford when i was in canada. and every piece of artwork was a [ __ ] tan. and aquamarine eagle so but ya know so i did. so riverside show was [ __ ] awesome. and then we went and we got it. ah dude my [ __ ] both of the guys i took to. open for me craig and mike. were dude they took all the mercy i packed all the merch in they didn't even pack it they put it in i said i'm getting a sprinter van. for the weekend and they were like ah cool. and they usually pack up. like three suitcases of merch. and stuff it all in there. and instead they didn't they just took the boxes. of merch and put it in the van. on the way to. riverside and we got out of the car and i was like what the [ __ ] and there were like eight boxes of merch and i was like what is all this [ __ ] and they were like oh we're just gonna leave it in the van and i was like what and they were like we're just gonna put it in the van right and i was like no what are you talking about and he said we're not with this van isn't with us for the weekend and i said [ __ ] no it's not dude now let me explain why that's stupid now everybody if you like me your bloods boiling right now even just reminiscing about it okay i want you to. just take a sentiment all right. would you just relax. i want you to.

i go in and the [ __ ] air is always blaring first. thing daddy does is turn that. [ __ ] off i let that i let the [ __ ] mechanism rest for about five minutes and then that he turns that [ __ ] heat up bro 76 at least you understand me okay now my opener mike is a fat [ __ ] alright now we know about fat fox dude they get what say it together if you're in your car you're in your cubicle everyone said together they get what sweaty okay their hands are all clammy and they're [ __ ] you know what i mean it's all [ __ ] sweat he's got all sweaty sweat they sweat on there where everyone say it together forehead everyone stay together [ __ ] sweat where everyone said together under their under their nose in their lip you ever see that [ __ ] butt when you were remember that one kid when you were in a like fourth grade that got this sweat above his lip what the [ __ ] was wrong with that kid bro i could sweat i could be in the sahara desert with a [ __ ] parka on and snow pants and straight up a ski hat and if and i would never get the beads of sweat above my lip dude that kids was always so [ __ ] that kid i would stare at that kid man when he would talk and be like why are there beads of sweat above his lip with the [ __ ] sweats on their lip bro grow up hurry up grow up and grow a mustache hide it dude i'd rather see someone with a wet stache than a [ __ ] beat it up her lip ill dude ill bro anyway he's like oh it's so hot so we turn on the air fine you know you know like with cars i've literally if you can get your temperature perfect in your car. i straightup don't believe you it's either. too cold or too. hot that's how cars. go because you're in too close. proximity to the [ __ ] air conditioners of the heater. all right it cramped up. you're basically in a [ __ ] little thing you know you're looking this. movable large embryo anyway so so i went. so it was cold. and then so it was cold. and then and i was like it's too hot. i was too cold. so i put the [ __ ] on and dude when i turn the air. off the thing still counts. what degrees it is so. i turn the air off and it quickly. ripped up to 82 degrees. now guess what i am happy. and i'm serious and i'm not sweating. i'm chilling you'll have. an iron deficiency maebh. i fall asleep for a little bit. now sometimes mike will [ __ ] sneak the air. on but that's when i get rip. roarin matt okay so he didn't do. it this time i wake up. bro he's naked he took off. all his clothes except for his. [ __ ] spanx underwear and i look over and i'm like this. [ __ ] really has underwear. on and that made me happy. because that's how you do it. you don't [ __ ] around dude. you don't change the air conditioning. for the guy who's paying for the [ __ ] van. by the way craig was on my side. he was like i like getting high anyway. you can't [ __ ] get your air. right in the car what was the deal. with that everyone's log said about tesla [ __ ] prius and all that [ __ ] bro get the air right man that's what i'll be happy so i'm trying to. [ __ ] and i'm cool with my sexuality man. they could do some events. i don't give a [ __ ] man. diggs flopping around don't care. forgot him i was back. for a little bit oh bro. i wanted to talk about this. this made me laugh. so uh oh also wait hold. on we were in san diego. oh man this made me laugh. we were in san diego. mmhmm and we went to. go get a lunch me and the three it. mean the two of us. craig and mike we sit down we're at a bar. it's got like a bit of a bar. menu find whatever okay i get the turkey. wrap it's got a wheat wrap and your boys. trying to keep it healthy. okay it's fine mike. goes like this i'll get the the frank. sandwich and i say oh cool. in my head and he says and she says okay. right sit down on her. pad and then she and then mike. says is that a cheeseburger. and she says yeah now we all know. it's not we all know. it's hotdogs because nobody would ever. describe a food as a frank when it's not a goddamn hot. dog right if i was eating. a cheeseburger and i said hey man. this ballpark be frank sure is good you'd say quick get that guy to. the hospital cuz he doesn't know. what words are all right. so by the way what the waitress. did was correct he said. that's a cheeseburger right and she said yeah because you wouldn't want. to make a guy who's obviously lost. his mind or broken his brain. upset you just agree with crazy. people it's like when a [ __ ] guy on meth. is on the sidewalk. and says you know jesus. is coming right you just say yeah. yeah yeah so he said i'll have the franks. and she said great. and he said that's a cheeseburger. right and in her head. this was a crazy. guy on meth with his pants. around his ankles saying you know jesus. is coming right and that's what i thought too i. thought oh how sad. mike's brain broke keep it. at bay she said yes. i wanted to shake. her hand but i didn't make a big. deal now cut to. obviously way too long. later because it's a bar and bar food always takes. too long she puts. down two big messy. hotdogs and i look at mike's. face and it's not good. not because he's [ __ ] a six but because his face did something like what the [ __ ] she leaves. and he says i don't want this. and i said huh. and he says i thought it. was a cheeseburger and i said huh. and he said did you see. me ask if it was a cheeseburger and i said yeah and then she said yes it was a cheeseburger and i said course and he said but it's hotdogs and i said yeah gosh and he said why. did you say it was a cheeseburger. and i said cuz she prays. broken your franks. you ordered some
