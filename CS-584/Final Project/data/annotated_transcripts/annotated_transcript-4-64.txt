as good as the right side of the shits and then i check with one fire one fire legitimately said said to. me today before we started i don't think it's a problem. with that i think you have i think have ear. problems and that was the most disrespectful. thing i've ever heard all of 20/20. so far so it's all good. but that's you know that's legitimately. what happened so i got your problems already. and i'm not even 40. my dad says what so. much and he's 72 sometimes my dad. says so what so much. that he just gives up. sometimes and i could see his face. just be like oh i'm just not. gonna hear that and that's gonna be the thing. i'll say something like do you like spaghetti. and he'll be like i don't lay. all he has no idea. even that i'm asking a question. he's just pretending to. hear what i have to. say and thinks it's a statement. all good dude but i'm gonna do that. too and i'm probably gonna end. up doing that when i'm [ __ ] 42 because left ear. already gone my babies so anyway i'm doing what would the [ __ ] was i gonna say god. damn life rips were all back. so go get that [ __ ] gonna sell out and i also got an argument with my opener last night he doesn't know turns out it's a main segrand story you can check it out for a few more. hours turns out he doesn't know. what it means when i say or when anybody he doesn't know. the phrase bull in a china. shop now that's the dumbest now. i didn't know there were levels. of dumbness that went that deep. hello but here's a dumb. shovel you diggin what dude you don't know what bull in a china shop means i said to. him you're like a bull. bucking around and he said well. that's a good thing i said yeah. but you're like a bull. in a china shop and he said a china. shop and i said do you know what a china shop. is and he said yeah. it's a shop and i said full of and he said china. you know he said china. things and i said hey man what's china and he said glass dude. he didn't know what it. was got mad blood levels rose. okay he hits the table. so much when he talks to. it it drives me nuts. man and i got all the other guys. on board with it. too they understand that. he hits the table too. much when we're talking when he's talking he'll just be like talking. and hitting the table and [ __ ] and my elbow. is already on the table. because i don't need to. be keep hitting them. cuz here's the other thing. too if you're listening to. me great good for you. if you're not you don't get some hot. lasagna you don't get a conversational. plate of hot lasagna and that's on. you because what i say it's free. right now i get paid. to speak so if you're not listening. to me that's on. you all right so this. guy's [ __ ] so i don't so that's how i do it you know it's like the whole mobster thing. it's like the loudest. person in the room his guy. doesn't say [ __ ] at all you know that's probably in every other [ __ ] mob movie the loudest. in the room sometimes it's the most. silent that's definitely a line. in some [ __ ] student film you know and that that somebody's that somebody's uncle says and and so he's [ __ ] always hitting me and touching me and hitting the table and [ __ ] the guy so he so wishes he was from new jersey and he's from a place that's even more new jersey than new jersey and that's florida uh so he was doing all that [ __ ] and that was pissing me off and i [ __ ] called him out on and we were all laughing me and the other guys were there craig tonin mark hayes and anyway that's the [ __ ] story from last night found it do my coffee being closed the [ __ ] down man so sad but life reps they're not gonna stop me from having a good time kickin it at a cafe that i like and sipping some iced americano. dude i got one right. here in my batman cup. at a home but they're not gonna stop me. dude these people come up. to me and they're like aw. man your coffee being closed. down what are you gonna. do cuz it's turning. into a starbucks bro. starbucks tastes like the back. of a cow's mouth. y'all know it found a starbucks. though found a starbucks that i go to. in the meantime and it's it's it's fine. a cop pulled me over. on the way there the last time. and it was the [ __ ] dude because the cop. pulled me over and i was like please. be young guy please be a young guy please don't be 70. because if he's 70 he doesn't. know who i am but if he's 35. there's a chance he'll let me. go and he comes up. to me he says hey man. and i say hey man. sorry and he says oh it's all good. are you the comedian. i said yeah he said i'm a big. fan i said i'll cool. he said well i'm can i get your license. and registration i gave it to. him he said all right. man well don't worry about it. and i was like [ __ ] in kept on rolling dude. when a cop doesn't give you a ticket. you feel like [ __ ] dj khaled you're just like another one anyway uh yeah dude but news news. guess what guess who's a [ __ ] real daddy now i had my baby. boy everything is completely healthy. and everything is great. and i'm in love i'm. in love with this boy. do you understand that do you understand. how somebody could just come out. all of a sudden you love. them like you knew him. 15 years do you understand. that do you understand. you can just love somebody. immediately bro i'll hold him. i would hold him if my back. hurts and it does hurt. and i still hold him. he shits i check it. with my hand boom around back. i don't need to. open it up i don't give a [ __ ] if i got [ __ ] on the hand i go wash it that shit's from me anyway dude i love him so much immediately and i'll hold him and i'll [ __ ] kiss his nose it's so great wow do you know what it's like the experience when you have a baby wow i can't believe i'm saying this right now but do you know what it's like the only way i can describe it cuz everyone describes it and you're like oh really i guess i don't know what it's like cool you know if you don't have a baby a lot of you guys have babies out there a lot of you guys don't have babies and that's fine and a lot of guys will have babies in here like i wonder what it's like let me ask. let me let me hit let me. list let me listen. you know here's a hot. plate of [ __ ] conversational lasagna you might like everything in life you can compare to. something else in your life. everything from a really obvious. one like if you play football and you play. baseball before you like there's a little bit like baseball i'm running. around trying to catch a ball. too living in an apartment. there's a little bit like camping. you can draw from it you know. if you were an alien that came down to. the world and you were like oh some people camp. and live outside and some people live in apartments you wouldn't think it. was much different you'd be like this. is just how they reside do you know. what i'm saying but having a baby. is not comparable to. anything else there's not something. you can draw from in your bank. of experiences when that. person enters the room you know. you just immediately sit back. and you are you know. what you're doing you're pondering dude. you're just thinking and you're barely thinking. though you got like a little bit of a blip boop. boop that's you thinking you're. like i get and then you're just looking. at the baby and you're stupefied cuz you're thinking because you're live. but you're not really thinking of actual things. you know you've got this worldly [ __ ] it's like this sunrise is happening. inside of your head and you're holding. your baby and you love. him it's not even love. it's the next thing it's like when you when you go. to the east coast. if you learn about attics you know. like oh we don't have those. out west oh but that's the [ __ ] love up there you got [ __ ] higher you go back to. you could be from the west coast. you go back to. the east coast you're like oh you got another floor. on top of the top. floor that shit's where your baby. is in the attic that's love. and then just chill him. with him in a rocking chair. man it's so beautiful. man and it's awesome. the youngest man alive finally has somebody younger than him. and i love it i'm not even. 40 how are young he's beautiful. too man he sleeps about [ __ ] 26. hours a day and what is that. surround sound noise that babies. make it's like it doesn't come. from their mouth what is going. on it's like all of a sudden. you have headphones on and you just hear you're like where's. that coming from do you know. what i'm saying a baby. will just be chilling. his mouth would be closed. and they'll be like and you're like how did you make that. noise [ __ ] hey dude how'd you make that noise. oh dude a baby. can make a noise with their mouth. closed and make it sound. like an open mouth. noise babies are [ __ ] crazy and their mouth is closed to. do it it wasn't coming. from hey baby where's that. coming from but he was good he was a he's a little bit. he was six pounds. nine ounces and he [ __ ] broke he's drinking milk you know from the titty i don't like how to. i don't know how to. say i don't like breastfeeding. and this [ __ ] you're supposed. to you're supposed to. go you you're born and i don't know if you know this i didn't know. this but you're born. and then you lose the weight. and then you're supposed. to be back to. your regular weight in two in two weeks. so if you're 6.9 or whatever. the [ __ ] then you lose the weight. and then in two weeks. you're 6.9 again this [ __ ] in five days gained four ounces. he's a fatty you just keeps drinking. that teddy milk but he loves. it do it he loves. it whatever we're gonna do man. i think he's gonna have a good. body when he gets older. i think it's gonna be jacked cuz we have good. bodies man this dude's gonna take the best. of both shits you know. you're gonna be like oh we thought. daliyah the dad had [ __ ] mountains. on his on his back. we thought they filmed. lord of the rings on his back. bro this baby [ __ ] a trilogy this. guy's got a whole series. they're doing a tv show on his back. but yeah it's a great. bonding experience too if you're if you're with with with. your whoever you're doing it. with your wife your girlfriend. whatever it is it's just amazing. it's just weird and then also i cried. for [ __ ] three days straight straight up cried when he came out never stop put him skintoskin cuz i do that i saw the rock do it on instagram but i would have done it anyway and i put it on i didn't copy the rock but i put the baby. on the on my on my chest. and it was so a [ __ ] sorry i don't mean to. go on about as a comedy. podcast but dude [ __ ] y'all this baby's this [ __ ] and also he's cute. and i think that you know. sometimes i think your baby. is so cute no. matter what i think also taking myself out of it. if i looked at the baby. like that's a good one. aesthetically pleasing but i put him. on i put him on my my chest. and it was and i started crying. again oh man. there was one time where in the middle. of the pregnancy the nurse. was like sometimes the baby's heart. rate drops and i got to. hit this button and a lot. of doctors come in and don't be alarmed. it's very common but it is. very overwhelming and don't don't worry about it. i got to hit the thing. i got to hit this. button it's the button to. let them all come in and when they come in there's gonna be like 25. of them and they all do different. things so it's an important. time when i hit this. button and i don't know what's wrong. exactly so all these doctors come in. and we all try to. figure it out and and that's what happens. and i was like okay. okay i hope you don't have. to hit the button but if you do okay. and and they were like doing it. and they were like okay. and something happened and i was like i didn't know what was going. on and i could see the nurses face and she got not worried. but concerned and she's like okay. a lot of doctors are coming. in so the [ __ ] went down the [ __ ] happened the heart rate wise is everything. okay and they said the heart. rate dipped a little bit. we got some doctors come. in dude do you know. do you know how many doctors come in okay. first of all they put oxygen on my girl. my girls looking at me. like is it okay. and your boy doesn't know. because i'm a comedian. i'm the only person in that. room that doesn't make any difference you got nurses you got doctors you. got [ __ ] doulas by the way what's that mean is that a midwife i don't know i don't even know the midwife is i barely know what a wife is all right and so they hit the button dude and all these [ __ ] come in my girl looks at me like is it okay and i'm like mister and charge always in charge of everything and i'm um i'm like hey for the first time i think and so many doctors came in dude it was a joke. it was like one of those [ __ ] japanese subways where they were just like put we need more doctors in there were dug. by outside just putting pushing. jump running and jumping in cuz they couldn't fit here i come and then dude. they kept coming and dude. it was like the [ __ ] the the coolio video. where all the people kept coming out. of the trunk it was. like that i was like come. on dude it was absolutely. ridiculous it was like this. there's a button in this happen. [music] doctors came in with their stethoscopes fantastic. voyage heart rates dropping drippity. drop her trace tripity tripity. drop in come on y'all. let's start to cry. wow it's too [ __ ] overwhelming come alone. the hearts drippity drop in by remedy by hopefully they [ __ ] kid survives and i'm just like jesus. christ hi i'm doctor dude and the doctors were so young. they could be friends. with the baby that came out. the doctors were so young at cedar cyanide they were literally they look like djs. they just came out and they were just like hi. i'm doctor you could just call. me steve actually i'm not even. done with my [ __ ] my name is steve just called me steve. i'm gonna help out i may be i swear. to god what are you oh. i'm the dj i didn't know if they needed. did they need a i could play something. well what are you gonna play. are you [ __ ] kidding me.
