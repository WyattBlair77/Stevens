like a whole stadium and he did he not. say anything just weird weirdness. and here's the other thing. too because he's very talented. but people will now be like oh gotta be weird. to be talented. and just [ __ ] up the whole game. they've been doing that by the way. people think just because they're weird. they're talented kanye's sending the wrong. message out there damn that's sweet. he named it donda that hits. me right here dude. head smaller i watched ice road that movie. with liam neeson because i had to. because liam neeson is in it. i'll tell you right now. one thing i noticed in ice. road and that i think i noticed before. in other liam neeson movies. but i wasn't equipped to. understand the magnitude or idea of it. because sometimes your brain births. an idea and sometimes you don't realize until you fully understand. that that idea was already given. birth before you even thought about it. do you understand what i'm saying. i thought i thought of something and then i realized it's a truth. it's out there and what i'm about. to tell you is the idea and the truth. liam neeson has the sexiest nose out. of any man i've ever. seen in my life that's it. wrap it up we should go. so podcast is over so it's all good. so we figured it out. so anyway let's let's pack up. and we should uh we should probably get out. of here how can i go up. from there liam neeson has the sexiest [ __ ] nose out of any not only action movie star any male there that i've ever seen that's it we should all right let's back up let's back up we got to. go we've figured it out. we figured out we did. some real work here on this. podcast let's go have you seen. it it starts in the middle. of his forehead his nose. starts here strong it's like a fist. that just pops out of his forehead. and then just goes straight. down at an angle of like i'd say whatever. that is because i'm not a mathematician. and it stops in the middle. of where a nose and a mouth. should be and though. that's where his nostrils are. and it's so [ __ ] strong it's just basically. two fists and it's so sexy. dude and i'm man. enough to say it liam neeson's. nose you talk to anybo. here's the deal you talk. to some guys that'll be like oh how can i tell i'm not. gay i can't do take those guys. out of the equation. those guys i don't understand. when guys are like what am i gay. i can't tell if a guy's good. looking one time i asked. my friend oh yeah is that guy. good looking i don't because i didn't me. i was like yeah what's his deal. was he tall is he good. looking he's like i don't know. if he's good looking i was like what. do you mean he was like gay. i'm not attracted to. guys he's like bro. what are you talking about. you know if a guy looks like cool. or if he's like hello. with a like bringing a [ __ ] slushy that's an ugly. dude i brought my own. uh snacks to the movie. like that guy's ugly as [ __ ] but if you look like [ __ ] you know what i mean if you got your vacation shirt on your hair quaffed back and you're looking at literally no one and you're a tall drink of water. then oops oopsie daisy you're good looking that's why. i gotta practice not making eye. contact bro cause i gotta get sexier. you know what would you say. just looking what do you say. they're right here what's that. what are you saying what. are you saying so you know take those guys out. because i don't believe in those guys. all right at all you're out. i don't know if you're homophobic or what it. is those guys are gone. you take a check and she's like i mean. yeah it's all right you know. she lying what is it what. what about the twofist thing. look he's got two fists. and they just come out. of it they stop there's a big. nose and hey you know. she lying it's all good. but you know that now the reason. why i knew in this. movie versus other liam neeson movies. that he had the sexiest knows of all time. was because a lot of the time. the camera was in the passenger. seat and he was just driving. so you get to. see a nice profile shot of liam. neeson and that [ __ ] [ __ ] knows dude he is just that [ __ ] nose is fire i've got a dick on my face the problem is you don't think i'm sexy and i'd agree with you except for one thing i'd like you to. take a look in between. my eyes above my mouth. and below my hairline what is that before. you answer no it's not two. fists get a little lower get in a horse. stance look up do you see those two saucered. holes no no no no exactly if i breathe. out right now you'll die. if i breathe out slowly. you'll die slowly. if i get in a horse. tents too you'll disappear. into my nose walk. away do it quick because i'm going to. turn my head and if i do and you're not fast. enough you'll get hit with my [ __ ] nose and fly off that cliff. dude i love this podcast. that's it you know. i love it i get to. talk about leave me some nose. for 20 [ __ ] minutes and you guys just listen and npr's out. there like well you know technically. you got to yeah you're not sure. in space and time. continuum and [ __ ] every time i turn on npr the funny. thing about the space and time. continuum what the [ __ ] is that dude. i googled space time the other day. i i swear to. god i real i was like i got to. know what it is i'm 41. i got to know. what space time is okay. it can't just be something. that one of my friends. says too much i have one. friend that says it way. too much everybody has the one friend. that says space time. too much and you're like dude. all right but how about this i want to. learn i want to. be a better person. so maybe i am the problem. maybe i should look up. space time and maybe i should understand. what space time is now. i'm just a lowly comedian. podcaster right i'm not even a [ __ ] i'm not even close to. a scientist i don't even know one scientist. so i was like let me just google. spacetime you could google. everything that's on me. if i don't know what a term. is that's on me. you could understand it and as my mommy says i'm smart. so i googled space time. dude 11 minutes okay i give up. i give up dude. you got me internet. i'm done i tried for 11. minutes i actually tried less. than that i tried probably for like six minutes. dude i'm out man i read space. time over and over again. i googled it i looked at websites i watched. videos dude i'm out if something's that. confusing bye bye if something's that. confusing see you guys later. out of the [ __ ] airplane pop the shoot me me after i [ __ ] bail from looking at spacetime playing on fire zipping by me a bird just smacks me in the face me after i look up spacetime for six minutes dude i don't know what the [ __ ] it means look up look at the the [ __ ] definitions that they have for space time just let me let me look it up and let's try to. understand this together dude. space time look at this. i'm googling space time. all right space time. noun physics noun space time. i don't know why [ __ ] dictionaries always do that. by the way you look up. car it'll be like noun. car car car noun. automobile car car and you're like i already. know what the [ __ ] i'm looking up. oh really carmen's car. it's so stupid and you know. what the [ __ ] i'm talking about i'll look up lebron lebron lebron the brawn french for the brawn. um here it is space. time the concepts of time. and threedimensional space okay. okay the concepts of time. first of all what the flying. [ __ ] house are the concepts of time do you mean time stop being so cocksucky when you're right in the [ __ ] dictionary dude narrow it down the concepts of time dude imagine you're at a dinner and somebody just says well you know the concept of time you would [ __ ] take a plate of potatoes and make them go vertical you'd be like oh did you just say did you excuse me did you say concepts of time yes by any chance do you like vertical potatoes they'll say no but i just want vertical potatoes all over your face the concepts of time and threedimensional. space regarded [laughter] has to. be the stupidest [ __ ] thing i've ever. said in my life like like checking with the guy. excuse me sir do you happen. to like vertical potatoes boom. because he says concepts of time. dude that's the stupidest.

you what it's about a lot of you probably don't know the movie's about a woman who has an anger problem and she's also because of that anger problem so strong i don't know you're looking at me like what chris i don't know is it a superhero movie or is it just a movie where she's actually i don't know so some kind of genius guy creates a device that isn't quite ready yet really but it's not quite ready yet and it's not sold to any markets yet but he hooks her up with a [ __ ] goddamn garage door opener and she every time she gets so angry she just start beating the [ __ ] out of people she'll just click the [ __ ] garage door opener looking thing and then she okay she's out on a date and the guy a guy's like i don't know i don't know says some [ __ ] and she's like and her eyes dilate and she gets all pissed and she clicks the garage door opener and she's like snaps her back into reality and it's not a comedy that's the movie and it's not an adam sandler movie it's a kate beckinsale movie about how dude these movies were i'm sorry but these movies where women do spin kicks to [ __ ] like like guys that look like big thumbs like you just it just make it a superhero movie the movie

stallone was in it and that dude can really bang the [ __ ] show sex life kristen put it on a little bit and then on the third episode the guy shows his [ __ ] you know it really hit me like a ton of bricks because i was like because the guy in the the show is cheesy and the guy i don't watch i watched the first episode and then she sent me a video of her watching the third episode where the guy shows his [ __ ] large [ __ ] and i was like what are you watching taken and she i said oh sorry i thought that was liam neeson's nose and um and and uh this guy's naked he turns around the guy is cheesy in the show he might be a good actor you never really know because the whole. show is cheesy so it's the director's fault. it's not the actor's fault. if everybody's good it's the director's fault. if everybody's bad it's the director's fault. you know what i'm saying um and uh so he's just being cheesy. and i'm like cringing i'm like that guy's so cringy. and she's like he's sexy and i'm like oh i'm way. off all right i don't get it. okay all right okay this is your deal. here this is your deal. let's watch it let me. watch just the part of his [ __ ] and i was like and she was like

oh so it. is real i was like dude. that means if he's if it's not. his real [ __ ] that is the worst way. to answer that question. because sancy the mayor of cincinnati. you're so insecure dude. a gentleman never tells it's not. my [ __ ] you know what i mean. a gentleman never tells my [ __ ] is a lot. smaller than that but like you can't. so i looked it. up and then i looked up another

[music] it got drunker. and answers my eyes so we can see it. why where is where's space. involved in that dude neil degrasse. tyson has the way he's trying. to compute you know what dude. you basically have the smartest guy and the stupidest. guy talking you know what i mean. and i'm not saying website is. the stupidest guy but pretty much. anybody is the stupidest. guy if you're talking about the crosstalk. and he's just like there's hold on. a second where's space and all that. is space in my eye. um it entered your eye. at a time and at a place. right here wow that's all that. that's all that's about that. is that's all well once. you have formalized space and time. and know that they're conjoined. then you can make all kinds of fascinating. calculations well what is all. that the trains going. down there i'm walking down. the train i'm walking on. the air and the time. and the training of james. what is all that that's all. the consequences of thinking. about space and time. how bad are both of their. breaths for real you can tell because of the room. they're in as conjoined but it's confusing. not only is it the universe. is under no obligation to. make sense to. william shatner okay no. but it's just william shatner's under the obligation. to make sense of the universe. as is you are doing and and and and why do why. do i slow down as i approach the speed. of light it doesn't apply. to a photon no you want. to freak out i don't you know. i don't want your head. to explode ready i'm ready. i'm ready okay the faster. you go around turn around. and check this out look the cosmos. say that again the fast. as seen by others right. as you approach the speed. of light time continues to. slow down yes at the speed. of light time stops which means for a photon moving. at the speed of light. when it is absorbed in your retina it. is the same instant it was emitted. at the big bang 14. billion years ago that's what i thought. oh it is guy oh it is some guy. dude un [ __ ] believable dude jeff bezos. was like hell yes. [laughter] dude unbelievable this. guy neil degrasse all. right i guess okay okay. no the other ties will do anything. dude he'll come to. the [ __ ] opening of a jack in the box. well i i mean you know. what i mean well i heard you get two. two tacos for 99. cents do you know if you had four tacos that. that's 1.98 cents and six tacos i've come here. to tell you that there. are billions and billions of tacos. that have been made and billions and billions. that could be ever made. and an infinite amount of hot. sauce that you can put on those. tacos and eat them and if you're chris's friend. from high school you can eat 20. of them at a time. it's disgusting it's an infinite amount. of absolute disgusting disgusting.
