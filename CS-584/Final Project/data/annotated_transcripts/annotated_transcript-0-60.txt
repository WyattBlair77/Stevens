what my buddy. tells me but who knows uh green bay. de moine and then you. know auckland new zealand new zealand. might i got in new zealand. um so yeah so that's just a little bit. of what's going on in the travels. of crystalia i went to. dude i was on the plane. the other day and we were texting. in a group chat. and my brother's like where you. flying from and like where you flying. home from and i i was on the plane. and i couldn't remember so there. we go so i'm at that. point in my life and i like that. cuz it makes me feel like i work. real hard if i don't know where i am because i'm a toring comedian. and it is kind of the truth. if i don't know where it's like that. the fight club when he's traveling so much. at the end because he's trying. to get in a plane. crash because he keeps traveling and traveling. to different places that's how my life. is um but yeah i was in uh augusta and north charleston south carolina. north charleston south carolina which i don't. think should be a a words. you say together how about that. north charleston south carolina i always. i i've said this before. i think on this podcast. uh i don't like the north if you call. a place north something and then you're there's no south something or east or west. there has to. be all four if you're going to. call it something right. uh but the problem is maybe there's not a maybe there's nothing over. there right like if you've got charleston you got north charleston maybe south charleston isn't is just you people. call it charleston right but if it goes below. maybe there's nothing there. right or to. the east maybe it's just a field. you know what i'm saying so this. is all stuff that we have to. think about um but i did go. there augusta is not my market yes dude augusta. is not my market neither is north charleston yes. dude so had a lukewarm. weekend yes but i will tell you this. though the crowds were awesome. and by by by it not being my market i mean. it just didn't sell out but that's okay. hey dude i am i am. not the kind of person that gets his self. worth from everyone telling him. he's funny is that a lie. yes okay but do we work out. in therapy yes and does it. help no but it's all good. right it's all good because it doesn't help. at all and so um so yes so it makes me. feel bad so it's all good. um but then you go to. place like florida and you sell out and you place. like victoria bc you sell out. you the place like anywhere in canada. youell out you go okay okay okay okay okay you just seattle. youell out okay okay it's all good um but yeah so uh i was in augusta and people are just like in augusta well. augusta has places that are so many business you know it's one of those places. in the south well it's one. of those places they're not. just in the south but it it's the southern. version of um uh like department. stores that you'd go in and you'd find suits that uh dl hugley. would wear in 1993 and they're all. too big you know even on the mannequin. and like the mannequins are sagging. and you're like who the [ __ ] is this. for and when's the last time. anyone's been in this in this. in this store and it's called phas or something. and like and and and and there's just a guy vacuuming in the front. of it and you're like why. are you vacuuming right. nobody's coming in and even if they are they don't. give a [ __ ] if there's dust because place absolutely sucks right and deal huy shopped here last person came in here was d huy and bernie mack and so uh and this was all good but those are lot of people that came in here and they bought hats you know um so it's in augusta and augusta's crazy dude augusta is one of those places look at the straw i got spooky halloween straw spiral because i because calvin. likes it remember these straws. the silly little swirly straws as a kid. i used to. think they were fantastic. and now i don't like them. and i'll tell you why takes longer. to get to my mouth. um and it actually is a a trick. on my brain i've been i know how fast the liquid. goes from the bottom to. the top of the straw. and on this one. i don't so it plays. a trick on my brain. and i don't like to. puts on my brain. um anyway uh augusta is one of those places. that uh is and i don't look. it's not my market i don't want. to bash it i everyone's like oh you're going. golfing if you're going to. august you're going to. golfing because the masters are there. right well okay now i don't even if a place. is only good because of golf. then you think okay well there's other places. that are you know it's got money. not downtown i'm sure the places. ac you know a little bit away. or nice but downtown first of all. is it racist that. they call it the masters. tournament is that is that like a a thing. for cuz anyway and a you go to. augusta it's just one of those places that feels racist okay. and you go there. and the reason why is because i i i found out when i was there. i was only there for you know 24. hours but the the statues. there's statues there. that are still there that you're like why. didn't they knock these down yet. like you remember when they started knocking down. statues of like i don't know. where i fall on that. like you know it is kind of weird. to have like you know. you got the people who are in the towns that. are like you don't get rid of these statues. this is history and it's like yeah. but dude was scalping you know what i mean. right right right right right. it's it's history but dude was hanging in scalping. you know what i'm talking. about about right right. right right right like we get it. history but he was lynching and scalping. am i right so it's like and i'm not talking. about tickets so it's like uh yes sc. head so he so it's like but but but but he was splitting. wigs do you know. what i mean right. so so take this so so i understand. why you want the statue. down because you want to. be reminded of getting your dome. piece taken off right and that's all good because two things you don't want to. be reminded of in your ancestry if this has happened is getting hung and also getting your dome. piece ripped off right now and that's just baseline. okay so i'm looking at statues. and i'm finding these statues and all. the thing this is what i don't. like about statues this. is the main thing i don't like about. statues okay uh that there's always some [ __ ] phrase. on like the thing that the guy's standing on. that you read and you literally never know. what it means you know. what i'm talking about it's like over. the ocean where we came from. the light hearkens down uh uh and that alas will be where we settle and you're like what. okay and it's just some dude. like holding a flute and you're like what. the [ __ ] who is this and then someone's like that's james madigan. iii he was you know he started with a violin shop. and then he and you're like uh and then and then you're like oh really and you're like yeah. yeah yeah oh and he also lynched. and uh and uh and uh and scalped. oh okay so it wasn't really. just about violin shop yeah but we don't you. know we like this statue and it's really. a lot of people did he lynch and scalp. yeah but he had a violin. store and i yeah that overshadows the violin. store thing man he was a violin. maker would he sell it. to blacks no oh okay h. why not well weren allowed. in his store cuz he you know. l scalp so um okay but there there was a thing in augusta outside of one of those [ __ ] deal huli hat places. that was like had like four statues. on it and under it. it said it literally said something. like a white society will. be the greatest thing that yada. yada and then the next thing. it said under it. was something like all else will fail. if not and and or something like that. and i was like oh and i was like well certainly it doesn't mean. hey hey look i'm white. and i don't buy a lot. of the [ __ ] that people say is racist that. it's not racist you know. and i think it can be racist. against white people i don't like when some people are like well you actually. can't you ever meet that. person that's like you actually. can't and it's always a white person. you actually can't be racist. against white people and do you know why. because they're not oppressed and it's like i yeah but i you know. it's like you can't tell me. amanda seals is not. racist you know what i'm talking. about so it's like i watched. a little bit of her. on the shannon sharp interview and i was you. know i don't know i you don't want to. diagnose people but she's a lunatic. and so you um but you know. h maybe she's not she's cool. i'm sure she brought me up. one time on stage as a white. guy so that's cool. but uh you know i what was i even. talking about so so i'm like yeah surely. you can't have this uh this. this statue up and also it. can't be racist right. it's not racist and then i stood i looked at the statue. and i realized it's just definitely racist. and just still up. you know i trying to. make excuses for it i'm like man. i got to knock this. [ __ ] down huh. then i went and got a coffee. and let me tell you i got two. coffees in a gusta and the [ __ ] was so good dude. who knew that they had. really good [ __ ] coffee and guess what dude. one time i went to. a bar and got a coffee. and it was mad. good dude um anyway enough. of that you know north. charleston was good had a good time. um but it's not it's not you know. what's up with this. drake kendrick lamar. beef i don't i just i they've each made 46. songs and it's like dude. i i i i'm just like i know. i'm 44 and i'm just i i listen. i'm listening to. this [ __ ] [ __ ] and i'm like in while i'm listening i'm like these guys need to. stop like i'm just like oh you guys. are just being really rude. you guys are being so rude. it's too much and don't say. all that stuff about each other. you know like when when when when kendrick's like i'm a hater. i hate you i don't like you it's just like oh god. and then he calls them. all this like uh oh and some of it's corny. right some of it's corny because they're just at the end of the day. they're rhyming you know what i'm saying. at the end of the day. you're basically a hyped up. gangsta version of sesame street. do you know what i'm saying. at the end of the day. you do what snuffaluffagus. does do you know. what i'm talking about do. you know what i'm talking. about drake you know. what i'm talking about kendrick. lamar you know what i'm talking. about you guys who battle. rap yeah but it's for the for the culture. yeah it is for the culture. but you sagus sopus is it. what is it snuffleupagus okay. well whatever it is it's stupid. snuffle up i guess it's for kids. but it's like some of it's kind of corny. because it's like yeah it's hardcore. and you hate each other. and you're a hater and you're bringing up. issues and you know drake says he's planting. information and kendrick is like yo. but but you have a daughter that's 11year old. it's like just for no. reason you know and then drake's like haha. i told somebody on my camp. to tell you that i had an 11yearold. daughter so you would use it. so we knew that you would do. that and you're like this. is all just too convoluted. man hey d hey hey guys stop hey guys you're both. super rich just make songs. you don't need to. be so you're rhyming. dude you do what snuff. alus does you got a red. trunk you got four red. legs in a red trunk. and pop out eyeballs no. dude just [ __ ] stop yeah but i hate you one time you lock your keys. inside your car for an hour. and a half that's so annoying. irresponsible it's like dude. and then when and then when kendrick lamar. does that [ __ ] like like he's rapping like he's like doing a voice and it's like hey gu guys guys guys guys guys guys calm the [ __ ] hey relax dude. drake's like and then i wonder. why you so obsess. with me and i would never have sex. with a minor and then it's like but wait a second. i was talking to. my mom and i was like mother. i mother i oh wait. a minute then i had a thought and it all made sense. and it was like okay. i realized that it was. like you were molested as a kid. and that's why you so obsessed with all this. pedophile stuff i would have been arrested. if i was a p. and you're just like what the [ __ ] hey guys guys guys guys guys can you make a song about just do a song about how you got a plane. do a song about drake. air you know i swear to. god i would have been arrested. i'm way too famous for that. it's like what what is. happening guys hey hey you're snuffle up. gu dude hey you're a care. bear you're rhyming. hey dude you're a blown. in a booth yelling. at a microphone you. know and then people are like oh at home. in their houses or in their car. and i love i love dude. i love i love people who are like at first. listen you know these these were the bars. that hit and it's like yeah. mhm it's like yo dude.

attention. this is a police woman in colombia that. is just i mean she's jessica rabbit. you know she's look she's attractive. okay she's uh i don't know. what the what the she's how what's like a now. a like a very nice way. to say it she's a uh pretty beautiful. you know what do what do. women like she's she looks like a th okay she looks like a thought and uh she's a cop. you know freeze just like all. right so all right. so and then the players believe it. or not many women were angry. about her work oh yeah. oh imagine this woman coming. to your house over a domestic. dis dispute and then a [ __ ] colombian woman be like just i mean this is just the oh hell no the most colombian alexia narz who is not only an excellent policewoman but also influencer is often called upon to. ensure security in certain stadiums during. football matches this is crazy. cuz why be a police i guess. she loves it right. but but also um yeah i don't know hey props. to her honestly cuz women ha don't have. to do [ __ ] you know what i mean you know what they can do they could just lay around. attractive women can just literally they can. just be places and win. you know what i'm talking. about they can just chill. they could just sit on a chair. as long as they want hang out. you ever see sometimes like a hot. chick just like oh my god my day. is so busy and you're like what do. you have to. do like i got to. go here i got to. go i got to. fix i have to. fix my nail i have to. go there and then i have to. go say hi to. this they're all they're hanging out a pool. and i got to. and you're just like you're busying yourself. you got nothing and that's okay. but stop acting like you're the ceo. of mcdonald's but her typical colombian woman's beauty. you know but her typical colombian woman's beauty. just so attracts attention. wherever she goes to. the point that she says it's common. to hear things like she can pin. you down she takes me. by the reigns and even with her i'd give her. a ticket per. week i mean i don't even. know what that last one. means she can pin me. down is that's you. know indeed although alexia is an authority she has never stopped taking care of her. physique and beauty but her presence. in the stadiums has not been well perceived by women who claim that their husband watches. the police woman more than the match. and to say that. such a woman should not be in the police. and should be on the corner. the police so that's how the [ __ ] [ __ ] got real colombian you know what the [ __ ] is she doing here man put her on the corner for
