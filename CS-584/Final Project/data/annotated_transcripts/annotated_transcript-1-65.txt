you gotta break right. maybe i should just only get the minivan. and that's it and just we should just have one. car that would be [ __ ] kind of ill. and just honestly put furniture in there. they're big dude just kind of live. in it you know. you can straight up get minivans. with like [ __ ] honestly furniture in there you could get them first of all optioned with seats. that are like you could either have them. like six seven or eight. seats and then you could have some seats. like facing the other way. you could have a desk. in there with like [ __ ] sconces and then there's one with the kitchenette that i think honda makes it doesn't have a full you know thing like no garbage disposal but you could very much just open the window and toss the chicken buns out. um so that's me about
