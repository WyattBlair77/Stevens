died and then we all laughed we had a good time but that's the kind of [ __ ] humor we do here at congratulations studios and uh and it was great do it and you guys weren't here and i really told it and this is one of these stories where i guess he had to. be there and it's true. and that's why i'm telling it. i don't like to. guess you had to. be their thing you understand. because of course you had to. be there that's why i'm telling you. the goddamn story why would you why. would i tell you a story about something. that happened that i don't think you should be. there that's a bad story so saying i guess. he had to be there. it's mood oh oh you're you. know what you are you're a slow. breeze you don't matter you. don't push [ __ ] around you're a slow breeze and it's already. 72 degrees be more memorable baby right that's why i say this [ __ ] don't be some guy that just comes out and says these terms that are around make up your own [ __ ] like yolo right i don't you know yolo is old but and you know if you say yolo now honestly it's probably cool you're probably [ __ ] cool if you say yellow now because that was what 2014 i don't know what it was but yolo dude i say yolo now and that's [ __ ] awesome i gotta wear sunglasses more man it's just [ __ ] my [ __ ] is so bright. um but yeah yolo dude. and and who knows even if yolo. you might live more than once. you you only live once you know. em maybe you live mylmto lim i can't do it i gotta [ __ ] type it out goddammit maybe you live more than maybe you live maybe maybe you live more than once milom toe dude that's my new [ __ ] dude [ __ ] yeah dude milam doe twice because maybe you live more than once dude milam toe anyway um that's not funny at all but i did it and uh so yeah dude yeah dogs are barking dude there's too many dogs in my house man not only do i have my dogs but i got [ __ ] friends over and they got their dogs and [ __ ] and uh anyway dude uh what was i saying we got their ears done dude have you ever gotten your ears unclogged you go to. the doctor and they just put saline in your ears. and you keep your ear. to the side for a little bit. and then you just dump it out. it seems pretty archaic but when you dump it. out dude it's like you blew your nose. it's gross and it's terrible. but it feels so good. and i don't know if it actually. feels good or if one of those things that feels good or if it's one of those things that you think feels good because you could just hear better i don't know if it actually is a feeling i suppose if you have a lot of real real hardcore pressure on uh your ear maybe it does make it feel good but uh when you get it out but i don't know i don't know and it doesn't matter either way but you should get your but i i did that and i could hear way better once and uh and so i got to. do it again and i think that uh and kristen just did. it and then also one fire. is going to do. it so if you can't hear go get your [ __ ] ears. unclogged but uh who cares anyway i'm gonna be at the [ __ ] oxnard oxnard improv. january 14th to. 16th i'm gonna do crystalia. and friends that's what i'm gonna do. you know your boy's building. his material

then all of a sudden. he's doing that [ __ ] movie where you're like whoa. okay and he's [ __ ] at the end of his career. now i'm not saying justin poury is the end of his career. he's a young dude. but you know the end. of a ufc fighter's career. is like 32 years. old and i think he's 32. years old but the guy just stepped up into. the hot sauce game dude. and that is where see. that's the thing dude. you got to get that. extra thing to. make you outlive a young. man's game and dustin poirier took [ __ ] hot sauce. and elevated this [ __ ] and he sent. me some and it's good as [ __ ] dude he sent me the hot. hot [ __ ] which i use it's very hot and also the nice mild [ __ ] and i use nice mild chip when i kind of want. to take it when all my taste. buds say kind of take the day. off

[ __ ] and he's like i don't really eat pizza. that much i got what i eat. i start every day. i write something lovely. to my wife and i'm just like whoa. this guy's got it. all figured out he really. does rob dyrdek has it. all figured out in the best. possible way and when i meet a guy. that's got it all figured out. like him kevin hart the rock. i go like this oh wow. i give up i didn't. realize no i don't give up. i'm realizing i gave up because the second you know. whenever you meet a guy like that. that's so good at talking and being engaging. and [ __ ] has hundreds of million dollars. or whatever the [ __ ] it is and they're always working what do you think you always think immediately the first is like huh. i wonder what my version. of that is i bet. i could do that somehow and then if this. is the thing the the amount of time. that you sit with that feeling. is how big of a [ __ ] bullshitter. you are you know what i'm talking. about like i meet rob dyrdick. and that guy has it. all figured out and i sit there. and i'm like wow that's amazing. and i i actually think huh. i you know i pride myself. on not being a big. bullshitter i like to. shoot you straight right i like to. shoot people straight so sue. me i like to. shoot people straight that's what i that's what like my one. of my things is right. if somebody says look at these shoes. and i don't like them. i'm going to say. they're all right unless i you know even if i don't you know. i tried to cultivate this. whole personality where it's like. i'm there's no bullshitter. guy so if you meet me on the street. and the guy and you're a fan. of mine and you're like hey dude what's up. i'm gonna be like yo bro. you're making this mad awkward. let's just chill and you can just laugh. at it cause you know. that's what you're gonna get right. i'm raw what you see. is what you get so i like to. think i'm a straight shooter but not. everybody is a straight shooter 100 of the time. you're bullshitting if that's what. you think so just try to. shoot as straight as you can. and you try to. shoot a straight and here's why. you can't shoot as straight. as you possibly can 100. of the time because you can't. even shoot straight with yourself it's too. hard to shoot straight with yourself. because not lying is easy. to do on the whole but you lie. to yourself right you. do you get oh this. is not gonna be that. bad you know right. you know you're stepping into. an awful party and you're just like oh this. will be all right i mean. you're tricking yourself yeah you know. what maybe it won't be that oh you. know dude right so when rob dierdrick. is like i do this. that this i write it. all down and i check my calories. and i do this and i got this many. hours of sleep last night. and i'm going to. get

i thought was me but i was probably. just 16 and i was like um i know i i had this. mentality like everybody's the same. they're either gonna let you down or like [ __ ] with you and this is coming from a guy who like had a great. [ __ ] upbringing i don't even know why i adopted this. [ __ ] i'm a bit embarrassed. by it but my dad. told me you know. you say people are all the same. but you're you're gonna be so shocked when you get older. how different people are and i thought yeah. you just don't get it. you just don't get it. when i was 16. i thought dad you just don't get it. it's so sad you lost. your way and uh i'm 41. now and i'm here to. tell you i was right. no i was not right. uh people are different and it's [ __ ] crazy now they all will do the same [ __ ] as people i think what i was trying to. say is like people are the same. when they're all together. they're pieces of [ __ ] but like an individual a person. is completely different than another. person i'm so different from rob deirdre. and frankly he's better. he's better oh dude. one time i was [ __ ] when i was i was i think i was 21. and i went to. a christmas concert. hate concerts but i went to. a christmas concert. you can go to. a christmas concert. and that's okay you know. because you're like you're doing something. different because it's christmas. time and i was watching the christmas. concert and i was with my girlfriend. at the time and dude. they were going i will never forget. this they were going. merry christmas to. you what this was the end. of the concert and they were going. merry christmas to. you all merry christmas. to you all merry christmas. to you all and they were saying that. way too [ __ ] much like so much just merry christmas. to you all and this. girl with really frizzy hair that was in it. and my eyes were just locked on. her for some reason. she had the frizziest hair merry christmas. to you all they started. walking down the sides of the auditorium on. the on the [ __ ] on the stairs. merry christmas to. you all and they were just and this. woman was merry christmas. to you all merry christmas. to you all going down. the stairs merry christmas. to you everyone's so jolly and not me. dude i'm like what the [ __ ] are they doing why is this woman's hair. so frizzy merry christmas. america down the stairs and she's going. down and says merry christmas. to you all dude. she [ __ ] stumbled dude she fell so [ __ ] hard in her red sweater. merry christmas to. you all and dude. her frizzy hair just went up. in a puff and she goes merry. christmas to you oh and she tried. to grab someone else dude. they went down with her. and boy for me. then did it become a merry [ __ ] christmas. dude and that's my [ __ ] christmas. story to you and i tell that to. calvin every christmas eve when he goes. to bed and i scream. it like i'm screaming. now he didn't really pay attention. last year because he was [ __ ] eight months. old but this year this motherfucker's. gonna understand me boy. merry christmas to. you oh dude i'll never forget. that dude i will never forget. that it was so funny. i wonder who that. woman is she was probably 50. then nah she was probably like late. 40s that's the greatest age. to fall down the stairs. you know that's like the perfect age. of falling down the stairs. is late 40s because any time. before that you're like ah they're all right. and any time after that like 55 you're like holy. [ __ ] this could be the le this could be the end of that person but [ __ ] that sweet spot of late 40s. falling down is perfect dude you'll watch somebody fall down the stairs. all day when they're 48. you'd be laughing. the whole you won't even help. them you're just like holy [ __ ] there goes frank just stumbling stumbling stumbling like a goddamn cartoon just stumbling falling oh it's [ __ ] hysterical but when they're [ __ ] 19 or like 30 you're like ah they're gonna be okay it's still funny but [ __ ] [ __ ] man 49 is when they do that oh [ __ ] and you're just dying the right amount of pain for that [ __ ] so she went so when she merry christmas. to you all she was at that. sweet spot where i just fell. the [ __ ] off my chair dude. forget it everyone i'm like you don't get it. dude she's at that sweet. spot falling down the stairs. late 40s right like if my dad. fell down the stairs. right now i'd be like this. is the end that's it. there you go he's 73. yeah he's agile but dude. he's 73. if he bonks his head in the wrong. way he's gone um yeah man. i was sitting on the couch. with my dad and calvin the other day. uh they were over for family. dinner and i was i was talking to. my dad and my dad. was like um had calvin in his arm and i was next. to calvin so it was like the three. of us and uh my dad. was like hey calvin me. and you he goes like this. hey calvin me and you we're both. in the same boat and. uh i thought about what that. might mean you know at first. i was like oh they're delias. we're all in the same. boat but then i was like. [ __ ] man he's 73 and my son is a year and a half. you know it's that thing. like my son is becoming this [ __ ] person. like every day it's a new thing. i think tamar is going. to wake up with stubble. like it's so new everything. is new and he's learning. to do [ __ ] like i said the other day. he said sassa and now he says santa. he's learning [ __ ] he's got a t and not only can he do it he can do it in the middle of a [ __ ] word that's something new he didn't used to. do that [ __ ] he used to. just say mama when mama was downstairs. and now he says mama dances. one day he's gonna wake up. with some goddamn stubble. right he crawled out of bed. the other day it was hilarious. we have friends staying with us. so we put [ __ ] calvin in in his bed. in our room bro it. was [ __ ] hilarious i gotta get back to. my dad talk about my dad's story about. my dad but dude. he he was in his crib. chilling and um kristen went in to. go to bed and uh he woke. up because she was tiptoeing in and i was still [ __ ] busy. you know keeping it real. italian watching gamora till 3. a.m because that's how i [ __ ] do it and i was i was just kneedeep in [ __ ] mafia killings and drug drug runnings and uh and then i came in and when i came in he was still awake. it was [ __ ] four three o'clock in the morning. and he stayed up till 4. 30 dude and i kept trying to. bring him back and put him in the cause now. he doesn't have the walls up. because he's got the bed. the wall came out right. we took the wall the crib. wall down and now i'm like he can crawl out. of the bed so i'm like i'm in my bed. in the same room as him. and i'm looking at the [ __ ] nanite trying. to fall asleep but looking at the nanite. because the room's so dark. and i see him with his [ __ ] you know what i mean. like with his [ __ ] night vision eyes. just staring sucking his thumb. moving his feet around. i'm like this motherfucker's. not falling asleep but i'm watching. the nanite and um and i [ __ ] and i and i i decide okay you know what i'm putting the nana away. i'm just gonna sleep. and so i put the phone down and because that's keeping me. up too so i'm going. to sleep and i'm like i don't even. know if calvin's sleeping or not and he is uh not making a noise. because he was going. like this for like an hour. like for an hour. just whoa whoa and i'm just like jesus. christ this [ __ ] better be on a goddamn seesaw when i turn the lights up and uh and i look and and so i'm like oh he's quite but now he's quiet so it's like a little bit like in the front part of my brain i'm like oh he fell asleep but in the back part of my brain i'm like but diddy he could be [ __ ] quietly making an omelette or some [ __ ] for all i know right you got to. watch out for these babies they just [ __ ] they'd be doing [ __ ] right they could be falling down hitting their head and that's why they're quiet they could be quietly [ __ ] the other day he was eating a candle just straight up eating a candle like it was the [ __ ] snickers and i go kevin what are you doing and he walks over me like this he goes and i just open your mouth and he opens his mouth and i'm like trying to. scrape the [ __ ] wax off. of his tongue and he's like ah and i'm like what. the [ __ ] you did it. bro don't be eating candles so i left. the room took the candle. came back guess what he's eating. another [ __ ] candle so my point is these babies be doing [ __ ] with it without you so i'm like maybe i gotta check on him i should check if he's sleeping or not and i got the phone down already i didn't want to. wake up so i skipped the nan apart. and i just sprung up. and i couldn't see it. was really dark and i crawl over. to the foot of the bed. to try and go look. at calvin in the bed. crib i said bed. crib again because there's not a wall on it it's just [ __ ] three sides and he is not only i'm focusing on where the crib is and then my eyes focus in i'm like at the foot of the bed my eyes focus in in front of me about eight inches and in focus my son's face all of a sudden and he quietly says ha data if you think it didn't scare the [ __ ] out of me yeah out of your mind he goes ha tata don't be so creepy calvin not at [ __ ] 3 a.m when i'm i mean dude it scared the sh i'm like oh my i got so scared i didn't you know what i mean when you get those there's a levels of scare to. scare you like oh that's kind of scary. yeah wow and then there's oh [ __ ] you're like oh you jumped that's the scared. dude there's a level past that where you don't. even move and you just are like okay. okay cool i got to. go check if i if i [ __ ] myself um anyway babies be doing [ __ ] is what i'm saying so so uh so now i gotta go back to. the story where my dad was he said. we're in the same boat. and i'm like i let my mind. kind of wander what that means. the you know babies grow up. and they become people and moms and dads. and grand grandmas and grandpas i should say. it's like that benjamin. button thing you know it's like grandmas and grandpas get to. that age where they're like [ __ ] the they look like they're a third. of the way into. the movie benjamin buttons into. the movie you know what i mean. it's like a third of the way. where you're like the old guy. but you're becoming young and you're like oh it still looks kind of weird. because you're short and old and [ __ ] you know it's like a third of the way into. the benjamin buttons movie that's what [ __ ] grandmas and grandpas start to. look like when they're on their way. out and so i'm like [ __ ] dude that's a boat too you know at some point you just pass. each other the grandmas and the grandsons. the grandpas and the granddaughters. you just pass. each other on that way. on the way out and on the way. up and you're just like we're basically the same. at this point right. i mean i saw when my when my grandma. died it was like she didn't. know who anybody was my grandma. died and she uh was so messed up. in the head she had cancer. and she didn't recognize anybody she was. in the hospital and uh and she was uh she didn't know. who like her grandson was and that. was uh that was a tough thing. to [ __ ] see but also like i mean my aunt brought a card from jordan uh and jordan was how old must have jordan been when he was when my grandma died must have been the age to. where it was hard. for him to write. his name but he could do it. you know he did it. with a crayon he wrote a note. for her and my aunt his mom. put it in an envelope. and uh gave it to. her gave it to. his mom to. give it to. grandma because he wasn't going. to go to the hospital. because also it was very weird. like she couldn't really recognize. people and she was you know on her. way out and um and he uh and it said and he wrote his name on the thing. and my uncle his dad. gave the um the note. to my grandma carmella satalian but that's her. name and we called her. karmzy it's italian and um when she gave it. to him he said she opened it up. and she read it and she said oh that's uh so sweet. it's fr she looked at. the name and she said it's from it's from sherrod. and my uncle mike said what no it's from your grandson. and she said and he said no your grandson. jordan it says jordan and then my grandma. said well then who's sharad. and that's hysterical but it's also sad. um because [ __ ] charade is goddamn no one you made it up now we gotta act like sharad's a person. now every now we always [ __ ] stand our family who's charade if we have a laugh man. [laughter] um so yeah man my dad's doing. well i'm not trying to. say he's on his way. out he's not but like uh it just got me thinking you know there is that moment where the [ __ ] grandson and the grandfather have to. look at each other and they're like there's that's there's that. moment where you're where they look at each other. and you're like oh [ __ ] we're the same at this point but i gotta leave and you gotta [ __ ] become wow that's pretty crazy um i would still honestly trust my dad driving more than calvin. driving though so we're good we got some years. left we got maybe we got at least. a decade left maybe um i just wonder if secretly that. was the boat he was. talking about let's do some misconnections. and then let's wrap this. up huh i should say. go to crystallia
