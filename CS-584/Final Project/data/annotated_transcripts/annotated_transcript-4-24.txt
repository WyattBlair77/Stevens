[ __ ] it's 100 all [ __ ] this is [ __ ] dude it's a hundred percent. all all [ __ ] the whole deal is [ __ ] the dude got fired for saying something i don't even honestly i don't even know what he said but i'm sure he was trying to. joke or whatever the [ __ ] i know he was trying to. joke and he said it. on a podcast a decade. ago or some [ __ ] and by the way. everybody knew so here's what happened. a guy since alex trebek retired. or did he actually he passed away. did he pass away. yet he did he died. and i know that and i'm not a bad person. but i do know that. and it's not that i forget. that i knew that i just secretly i don't. know something something happened so i'm not a bad guy. i do love alex trebek. i think that he's great is. it alec trebek or alex trebek i know i'm kidding. so um we do jokes. here so alex trebek uh passed away. and that's very sad. he was a very very beloved. uh host game show host and he hosted jeopardy. and he made the show the show you know. and when he passed one. of the producers stepped in they weren't. sure uh if they were going to. keep him or what they had like guest. hosts and and whatever it turned out. that this guy happened to. be um the uh the the um the ho. the best job to. fill the the thing now when he got the job. of course he's a white guy. and everyone was like oh [ __ ] white guy shouldn't have got it whatever he actually was you know a a a fine host for jeopardy. i think he deserved the job. because he produced jeopardy. for a long time he was one. of the executive producers. of jeopardy i believe executive. producers which means top dog on. jeopardy if not producer but whatever either. way he were behind the scenes. jeopardy became the host and it was all good. until people got mad because he was a white. guy and they the the powers that. be on the internet or whatever. drummed up all everything old in the past. that was gonna [ __ ] them and they did and they said oh look what he did. what he did he called. uh i don't even know. what he did i don't even. know what he did honestly. i i didn't look that. up because i don't give a [ __ ] the problem is he said. it a decade. ago and it was on some podcast. or something like that and all these [ __ ] angels on social. media are now attacking him. holier than thou and saying he can't. be a host on jeopardy. and here's the deal. dude the guy the guy. stepped down now here's my problem. with that okay here's my 100. problem with that first of all. the powers that be the angels. that are infallible that are online. and you know that they're infallible because they have twitter. and you know that they're infallible because they have read. it and nobody ever on reddit or twitter. has ever said anything bad or done. anything bad because even if you do bad. [ __ ] why would you hide out. on the internet under a [ __ ] pseudonym like lim bizkit. 68 or some [ __ ] these are the people. who are trying these are the infallible angels. that are trying to. bury some game show host that has a past. like waldo all right. so jeopardy buckled and i say jeopardy. buckled because the guy mike. richards the host of it stepped. down now we all know. if you have half a brain. we know all good we cough and we move. on but we know that. he did not willingly step. down we know the powers that. be what network is is. jeopardy on the powers that. be abc this is abc's. fault [music] the powers that. be at abc told the jeopardy. people we have to. protect the brand we've got to. remove him rather than us. firing him he needs to. he we're giving him a chance to. step down so the guy stepped down. now here's the thing [ __ ] you jeopardy. and i'll tell you why you want to. make a decision you eat. it you eat that. decision you eat that [ __ ] decision. and here's the other thing. mike richards you make them eat that [ __ ] decision. but you can't though can you no. you can't you can't can you mike. richards and it's not it's barely mike. richard's fault even though we can say. well why didn't he make them. fire him then because they were dangling the executive. producer title over his head. they said well either you quit. or we fire you. and if we fire. you how can you be executive. producer now that's the dirty. [ __ ] game that jeopardy. played that is the dirty game. that abc played you can't. trust these [ __ ] they're buckling to. outrage they are buckling to. outrage and that's bad because everybody even the infallible angels. they all have [ __ ] pasts so dude be careful. who you come for lim. bizkit68 [music] because one day they'll come. for you [ __ ] that man all these corporations. and companies they're holier than thou dude. these [ __ ] [ __ ] out there you know what networks do do you know what agencies do do you know what these [ __ ] hollywood types do they rob you [ __ ] they rob you they rob you they make it hard for you to. make money they try. to [ __ ] make the most money they can and suck the most blood that they can and not give a [ __ ] they turn a blind eye. when it suits them. and they stare right at you when it suits them. everyone's afraid of everything. dude who the [ __ ] hasn't been on a podcast. and talk [ __ ] about someone else i have [music]. cancel me again dude. everyone needs a youtube channel. everyone needs a twitch stream everyone needs. a [ __ ] whatever the [ __ ] i'm getting only fans dude because you need that mike richards getting only fans [ __ ] levar burton only 60 sure that he also was in contention to. be a host not sure so if he's not not [ __ ] levar burton and even if he's not or if he is not [ __ ] the barber and we did that for comedy so yes dude we're firing on all syllables and it's only been eight minutes. can't see it over there. so i have to. look at my computer and my contacts. are blurry because i'm passionate. dude when i get passionate. my contacts get blurry. it's like my super power it's the worst. superpower ever but that's what happens. dude i get [ __ ] angry. like the hulk and i don't get big. and green but all of a sudden. my contacts just go. and then i can't see so basically i'm daredevil. but it's like dude get it. together stop buckling to this. [ __ ] [ __ ] infallible angeled up. mobs man everybody's fallible dude. you could you know what. if the pope did a goddamn podcast could you imagine i know guys who are [ __ ] 50 60 40 years old that are like i think i might quit the business because they anybody has said anything mike richards what was the guy from jerry seinfeld's name michael richards great cool so we canceled now two guys named mike richards that's when you know the [ __ ] is bonkers we gotta [ __ ] get back dude you're gonna cancel so many [ __ ] people you're gonna be left with a [ __ ] you know what i mean a soccer ball and some french toast french toast is gonna be on the [ __ ] thing this is in jeopardy just a piece of [ __ ] french toast with glasses. on and a tie sorry. they canceled everybody. i'm french toast here we go. let's go to. the soccer ball soccer ball. what is it taco bell's. like what is bottaswana yes. we have to end it. we have to end this. early i gotta get up early. because somebody needs to. eat me for breakfast this. is ridiculous get it together. dude it's 10 000 people online. that are just destroying people's lives it's 10. 000 people online that are destroying. people's lives but what the [ __ ] do they care they're lim. kit 68. they're hiding behind some [ __ ] ass that's the other thing too i think it should be illegal for somebody to. have a dummy account online. i think it should be illegal. you know how many [ __ ] try to. kill themselves because another person out. there is calling them fat and they don't even. know who it is it's [ __ ] anyway dude i'm getting hot. i'm getting hot one fire got an air. dude every room in my house. has air conditioning got central. air my babies and that's great. except for this room and it's a podcast. room and why is that bad. now it is bad because why. is there one room that doesn't have central. why the one room that doesn't have. any air conditioning that's bad. but also why is it. that it's the only room that we're gonna use to. have [ __ ] crazy lights in it and it's so hot now one fire was like let's get a [ __ ] air conditioning uniform so we did we got one of those one with the long dick hoses that you [ __ ] put in and you they scooped the air from the other hou from the other area and they put it and they cooled it from the new area and we did that but guess what he didn't think of oh we have to. close the door and that bigass dick. hoes thing can't be in with the thing. and it's also too loud. so he [ __ ] up on two occasions. and that is why truly won. fire and that's fine. he's still one of my best. friends if not my best friend. however that is why one fire. so now it's hotty.

better. than me um yeah we still don't. know when uh we still don't know. when donda's coming out and i'm fine. with that i don't really care. you know kanye's kanye and he's [ __ ] losing his mind and that's fine. uh he makes killer clothes. and his music is you know. it gets worse and worse. but that's because of his you know. mental disorder and also he's focusing on fashion. i'm sure whatever and that's fine. dude and guess what the fact that. there's kanye west is fine. um [music] one of my friends. was like you know taking him. to task talking about how bad he is. for the world whatever dude. for some reason all bets are off with musicians. for for some reason all bets are off with musicians. but that shit's going to. come out donda the thing. about music that is the most annoying. thing and i don't know. if it makes it better. or worse but it's definitely the most. annoying thing is that music. is not about the music. it's not about the music. anymore remember when beatles. were all like we all live in a yellow. submarine and now six nine. is shooting people and [ __ ] coloring his hair red rainbow rainbow. bright right it's not. about the music. anymore it's about what [ __ ] kanye. said it's about the fashion. it's about what lady. gaga wore oh ever since [ __ ] bjork was that her name with the swan. that was the [ __ ] that did it when bjork wore the swan. it became not about the music. anymore she got so much. publicity wearing that [ __ ] swan. that it didn't matter. she was just [ __ ] dude the cranberry saw that and they were like what about libby on her. head what about libyan hey what about. zombie what about all that the pretenders. proclaimers proclaimers or pretenders no the other ones proclaimers are what about them they're like what about walking 500 miles and then what about walking 500 more what about walking a thousand miles and thinking about it when bjork showed up with that extra arm on her hip it became not about the music and now kanye does [ __ ] like stream at a party about how they almost killed their daughter. and aborted her before she was. even born sad get him. some help but it's not. but that's one of the that's the reason. why he's the biggest artist. in the in the world that's the reason. because it's not about the music. anymore kanye is fabricating and drake. they're fabricating this [ __ ] beef that they have or they really have beef but either way it's not about the music you know drake did a line that was vaguely shot at kanye. in a rap uh in a rap. song and then kanye tweet or uh. instagram drake's address too. far don't dox world stars it's too. far and also it's not about the music. anymore when you're out. there doxing [ __ ] you don't have to. [ __ ] [applause] you don't have to. do that you don't have to. double inside inside when you. can just [ __ ] wear a swan. you don't have to. why do you think janet. jackson pulled her [ __ ] titty out why. you think jt pulled her. [ __ ] titty out because they knew where music was going you couldn't this is why people are screaming. hip hop is dead dude. it's not just hip hop it's all. of the hop so it's like you know and by the way comedy's becoming that way. too comedy is becoming shock.

we were talking about drawing. and my buddy said and my buddy. was saying like i i used to. like drawing and i i was pretty. good at it and somebody said my friend's. a better artist than you. are i said really he said yup. because it was me and aristotle we were the two. guys who would draw well. me and aristotle arisata was way better. than me he really was um as a matter. of fact i think he grew up. to be like a [ __ ] architect or something. we got to draw. real sh like crazy shading and [ __ ] um anyway uh somebody was trying to. get at me and they were like they were trying. to like you know make you know. make me take me. down a few notches and they were like i know. a guy that goes to. a different school and he draws [ __ ] way better. than you and i went [ __ ] no he doesn't he said yeah. he does he could draw. bart simpson better than the guy. who draws bart simpson and i was like dude. i may be in third. grade but you lost me. do you know why nobody can draw. something better than a person. who created the thing. and i sat in that as a third. grader i sat in that knowing i sat. happy as a third grader. in the point that i made that i knew was correct and even though. they were trying to. get at me and take me. down a few notches with this. real or fictitious character that they said. could draw better than me. i knew they lost the argument. once they said that. once they said my friend. could draw bart simpson better than the person. who draws barcelona so first of all. you don't even know matt. groening's name second of all. i sat back and i relaxed. because i just [ __ ] laughed and i knew it. was right i knew i was right. how can you draw. something better than somebody. and i still to. this day to this day i still feel how i felt back. then
