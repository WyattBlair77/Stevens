[ __ ] but like don't have that it pokes. in the side right. and you never notice. until you're out and nobody has a scissors it's all. good it's all good. my babies um this is the whatever episode it's 300 and something i don't even know. i can't even believe how how many episodes. we've had and calvin came in earlier. obviously and messed with all. the levels on the headphones. cuz we couldn't hear anything. and then we noticed that. all of them were turned. down to a certain uh level. and that was definitely that. calvin that did that because he comes. in here and pushes the buttons and my gosh. i only feel love about. that you know if anyone else. were to ever do that. i would get i would get mad. but calvin's really kind of opened me up. and made me think about things in a different. way dude i tell you right. now this weekend this this weekend that we just had the past. weekend was dude so i was a little sad. on like thursday i think you know. some days you just wake up. and you're like okay and the whole day. you're just all right okay. i guess i'll go to. bed and and see what happens. tomorrow the next day wake up and you're like all right oh okay you know um the weekend was just bonkers connected. bonkers good great mood good. attitude and i'm just like dude. what is this what it's going. to be like today not bad. now it's monday right now. and i'm just like where's the bad. mood coming now i'll let you in on a little secret dude. i've been taking satala pram. for 17 years okay i didn't know. this but apparently what my psychiatrist. said not my therap not my psychologist my psychiatrist. i got so many ah it's hard. to deal with things. she said that they have a she said. sorry to use this. term but a poop out date now i don't know what it. is but i love learning. about poop so what is that. she says there is a time. limit on these ssris on. these medications i didn't know. that and i've probably i'm well past. the poop out date i'm well p. past the the medicine. going kut okay and i'll tell you why. think that because i switched i went. to do a little bit. of a switch on the medication. now do i wake up. anxious sometimes because of it. i think yes is it. because the therapist is it. because the psychologist said maybe it would happen. and maybe it's psychosomatic and she shouldn't have mentioned it. yes it could be right. but it's happening i wake up. a little bit anxious. and it's all good okay. and then i get really good as the day. progresses on thursday have a little bit of a saturday. and then friday and saturday. and sunday super connected now. did i start with 10. milligrams of prozac yeah he did and then a week. later did he go to. 20 milligrams of prozac yeah he did and then a week. later did he go to. 30 million proac yeah secrets out he did okay and while he was doing it what was he weaning off. ofr yeah he was okay. and was it 40 milligrams of cell. yeah it was and then was it 30. it was and then was it 20. yeah it was and now would at 10. so now we're doing 30. and 10 and i'm just like oh all right. need to make that louder. and and it's just like may is this. what life is like because i'll tell you what no. buzz no nothing right. look i've taken a vi ans. before i know what it feels. like it feels like you do. a relic coke all right. because it's basically riddle. which is basically coke. all right yeah can i pay attention. when i did it oh yeah. but when i took viance before i'm like remember when i took it when i went on the boat. there was an episode where i talked about. how i went on a boat. i took a viance because i thought that maybe i was going. to have a rough time. being on a boat with a bunch. of people because i didn't want to. be on a first of all didn't want. to be on a boat. second of all didn't want to. be with a bunch of people and we were going. to marry the two oh god. so took a five ants and i was the life. of the i was the lot. and when i say i was the life. i mean i was the life. of the party okay so i know what that. feels like it feels like you do a rail of coke. okay all right now i don't know what coke. smells smells like feels like but i know what viance feels like and i did. it felt like i did. a rail of coke. okay which is what i think. what coke is but whatever anyway. i don't feel like that i feel like my intrusive. thoughts are still there but they didn't matter. that much you know like i still think about you know. if i walk down this alleyway maybe later on i'll get cancer. but i go like this. whatever maybe it won't be for a long. time i go like this. there's the alleyway if i walk down. here ah maybe my mom will. get throat cancer ah she'll be all. right so i'm just like all right. so maybe i've been living wrong. for like 5 years with the i don't know. when the calan pooped out and look this is not this. is is a health and wellness podcast. but this is not a medical. podcast i'm not trying to. be like yo you guys. should take prozac yo. you guys should take you know. think but think about your ssr. man if you've been doing that [ __ ] for 15 years wof you might be in your poop out. date and i hope that this right. i i was saying it. to my therapist i was saying to. my couple's therapist i got so many i have so many therapist so i was saying to. my my couple therapist oh god. i have so many dude. and um and i was telling her. i was like i really hope it's a prog. prozac and she's like well you know maybe it is but don't worry if it's not. we'll get there and i go. all right you know and then she was like look in your wife's eyes. and tell her why how you feel and i was just like oh anytime. you got to do. that in coupes therapy if you're in couples therapy. look coupes therapy is great. because you know what that. whole book men are from mars. women are from ikea whatever the hell it. is um like it's unbelievable. how much it's hard. to be on the same. page with anyone now take into. a account a woman right. if you're a man if you're a woman. then a man right. so therapy couples therapy is good i do it. now do i want to. do i go like this. every single time we got to. go do it yeah now afterwards. do i feel better half. the time half the time i feel worse. but then i start to. feel better i guess so what happens. is therapy's fine when i'm talking. to the therapist cool sitting next to. my wife all good. but dude when i got to. [ __ ] turn when she says why don't you now look at kristen look in her eyes. and i go this is exactly. what i don't want to. be doing dude i love looking. in her eyes but i don't want. to be like looking in her. eyes and have her looking in mine. and be talking that that that step. is fine the look in her. eyes is fine the her looking. in my eyes are are good good. great love that let's stop it. right there because after that the me talking about my feelings. part oh no thank you. so chr why you look. in her eyes and tell her. how that makes you feel as a man. no thank you but you got to. do it because you're there. right the [ __ ] costs whatever it costs i don't know. they just char me every [ __ ] month and um i did it and she's like doesn't that. feel nice and i'm like i guess. dude but it's so [ __ ] uncomfortable man you know you know g like dude i was watching ice age. earlier and like the [ __ ] woolly mammoth was like took the spear from the caveman guy and he was going to. stab him and [ __ ] and then the and then they had the kid on the top of the woolly mammoth and was like look here's your kid. and they thought they were never going. to see each other again. but now they are and now the kids's. walking and the dad wasn't even. there but the animals. taught them to walk. and so it's like all right. but then they play the music and i'm like oh [ __ ] man like that really makes me if i let it feel if i let it i can feel very very deeply about that but dude i don't let it do i no no because it's [ __ ] ice age. dude because i'm not going to. let my feelings pour out of me. looking at a [ __ ] cgi woolly mammoth right but then i'm like man is that a problem like it feels so uncomfortable sometimes when you listen to. certain look i know. i talk about how i don't like music. sometimes look i heard a song that i used. to hear in high school. and it was too. much for me dude. and i go like this. oo maybe it's nice but i'm not. there yet and i know i'm still really. young 43 but like dude. it was like really [ __ ] me up. and i can't really listen. to something's blocked off. whatever dude you know i'm glad. you're with me thank you. for listening because who knows where i would be without you. guys and without therapy and without i think probably. my life would be roughly the same. name except for well. i think without therapy i'd probably be [ __ ] underground. um so uh but whatever dude. i keep it cool at the gym. i was at the gym. and i was killing. it okay as i do some some guy. comes up to me and says hey man. what's the progression how did you get to. where you get to. uh with that exercise. because what i was doing. is i was going. down on one leg. single leg touching my other knee to. the ground and rising back. up now that's very hard to. do it has a lot. to do with balance. and i was doing it. with 40 pb weights oh. god damn it dude. but i was though right. no lie no cap stop the cap. don't we have that somewhere right. stop the cap no stop the cap. so uh yeah dude no i was i was legitim imely going. down on one leg. touching my other knee to. the ground holding 40 lbs stop the c. and um and the guy comes up. and he says like dude. can i ask you what's the progression. like what's it like to. get to there and i said well. you started with no no no weight. and he was like well that's interesting. because it must make it. a little bit harder. but then you can put and i tell him. all about it and he goes like i walk. out i'm like dude. guess what that dude. asked me about uh advice. hey dude the icing on. the cake he was fit stop the c. dude he was fit okay. so i go and then i look at him. and he's fit and that's my [ __ ] confidence man. just growing up like i took a mushroom. and i'm wearing [ __ ] red overalls just loving it. man you know and i go and i text. i immediately text my wife. and our friend together. in a group text dude. fit guy really i fit guy. asked me for advice. and they go oh my gosh. okay guess what dude. the next day i'm working out. same dude comes up to. me ask me about for more advice. and then i'm talking to. him and i realize oh he's just kind of a [ __ ] crazy guy oh he's talk because he's talking to. everybody so i go oh [ __ ] he's not talking to. because he wants to. advice he's talking to me. because he's running from something. oh for [ __ ] sake dude but he was fit dude. and i'm going to. hold on to. that man i'm going. to hold on to. that cuz it made me. feel so good um i don't know. oh yeah i got this.
