restaurants or the or the or the or the starbucks. before the checkin you're a communist. us happening in your life. that you go to. the airport and eat before. you checkin first of all. the good [ __ ] is all beyond. security they know not to. who opens a restaurant who opens a chili's. do it before the checkin. what [ __ ] goes and thinks woo got to. the airport let's chill. before i get pissed off. security sucks get it all over with and then go to. chili's if you're at chili's before. you're [ __ ] taking [ __ ] out of your pockets you're a legit sociopath. dude i did it. once because i got to. the albuquerque airport because it's so small. cuz nobody wants to. be there cuz albuquerque absolutely sucks. donkey balls and i got there a little too early. and i ate there at the restaurant. bro they have a restaurant. a fullon restaurant. with a hostess that doesn't say seat. yourselves they say wait to. be seated because why who burns time. at the airport before you [ __ ] checkin got to. the airport way too early. i'm talking about early you. know why cuz i wanted. to get the [ __ ] out of there that's why you know why cuz albuquerque so i was there way too early and i

full meal. like a burrito or some [ __ ] you know i mean you know how i like to. keep it healthy but also sometimes. it's all out the window. when you're traveling when you're at the airports. all out the window. so i got a burrito. or whatever it is and then i [ __ ] you know what do you call it ate it there and then i checked in and it was all fine. but dude if you go to. like lax or logan. or jfk and you're [ __ ] chilling. before that's crazy what restaurant. would open a place. up before checkin it's already. hard to have a restaurant. it's like one of the toughest [ __ ] businesses and

[ __ ] slam that's for sure i hope his first words are actually no that's not the truth. just [ __ ] oh dude imagine your son's first words. were a slam if your son's first words. were just like yeah that's cuz you got fat. belly or if you were just like well that's because you're sure. you [ __ ] you know yeah well maybe you couldn't even get into. all the rides at disneyland. cuz you're short well maybe you should only stop maybe you should stop eating. carbs because you're fake a tire around. your belly that's cuz you're losing your hair. looks like you don't looks like this. line looks like in the beginning. dude [music] tourette's yeah that's amazing. um anyway dude what else we did. the ads what oh yeah let's do this. [ __ ] eldar dude. this was really cool. it touched me we'll talk. about good times and bad. times this is a good segue. into this we're bringing it. we're putting an elder here. here i got an email.

the honor. of becoming an elder. now but before i even go on here. let me stop right here so many. people are like am i an elder. yet do i get to. be an elder that's that takes you a few steps. back from becoming an elder. okay if you're asking to. become an elder that's like you want it too bad. it's like the [ __ ] karate guy that's like who do i have to. do to become a black belt you're in. the wrong state of mind. young grasshopper if you have both your eyes. on the prize then you're not using one. of your eyes for the journey. now am i a [ __ ] i'm practically. confucius how i said
