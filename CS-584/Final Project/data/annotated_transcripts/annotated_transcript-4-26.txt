 this is another episode of frog. zebra nation crazy crazy. [music] hell yeah dude hell yeah. it's congratulations it's another episode. of congratulations dude we're doing it. why is this thing over. the desk we started out. already [ __ ] it all up. ah yeah dude it is what it. is but we gotta go. make this go under it. we gotta make that go. under the desk because when it goes. over over the desk so [ __ ] how i'm doing it when it goes over the desk it [ __ ] pulls my head and when it pulls my head i look so [ __ ] so either way i looked a bit so really we had to. just make sure it was um it was a [ __ ] moment but whatever dude sometimes you have subbitch moments and then you get through. them and it's all good. uh but we're having a good time. and uh i feel like we're already firing on. all syllables and um and everything. is good are you did. you just turn the volume. down or something why would you do. that isn't that crazy you couldn't hear. it oh we'll turn hers. down but why would you turn mine. down crazy right wow let's yeah. we got it good. now i'm good now what we want. to do is not touch mine. right remember when p diddy. would be all like turn me. up in the headphones. or like mace would be like turn me. up into headphones and then every rapper. was like turn me. up into headphones people. would start [ __ ] freestyles off. like that and people would be like there's no headphones. um i'm keeping it really fashionable. and nice i got that [ __ ] pleated shirt on be more memorable. because if somebody can't remember you that's [ __ ] your fault. and this is what you do. to represent that notion we represent. notions all day long if you are a cult. member for congratulations meet me at the [ __ ] log cabin one. day so uh it's very beautiful it's very nice and it [ __ ] scoops it's very cool. i got that [ __ ] chain on like i'm like i'm basically you know carrying on the torch for dmx dude. when i saw dmx had that. short chain in 1999 i was like i can't wait to. [ __ ] grow up to. wear that one day so he keeps it. real i drink i drink coffee. and i just keep drinking. it and nobody can stop me. my therapist says maybe you know. you drink too much coffee. and i say maybe and then i [ __ ] go to. sleep and then the next day. we do it all over. again so that's what's up. um you know it's uh whatever day. it is whatever you're listening. to it um and we love being here. for you guys and by we i mean. me let's just jump right. into it um this is the greatest. [ __ ] this was on gawker i really don't know much about gawker to. me gawker sounds like something that is like not i don't know if it's legit. journalism or what i have. no [ __ ] idea but uh this was a real interview it becomes normal this is a real interview about a [ __ ] toast the swing of it gets it becomes normal i mean after you've seen a haunted toaster let's stop it right there let's stop it right there let's stop it right there haunted toaster are never two words that should go together okay because toasters only do one thing and that's make make bread hot they make bread crispy that's what they do know what they don't do possess ya no they don't do go a toaster is one thing and that's a toaster okay but let's keep going dude let's keep listening guy looks like francis ford coppola all good now there's a [ __ ] elbow of a chick let's see when they zoom out what she looks like we heard a qtip her head is the top of a qtip or the bottom of a qtip because if you turn a qtip around it's the same [ __ ] it's one of those things like race car. when you take race. car you flip all the letters around. it still spells race. car or toot this. lady is basically the [ __ ] human equivalent of toot. so uh why was this. a hairdo by the way. in the [ __ ] what was it the early. 80s why was this a hairdo dude. just that one big poof. just a big [ __ ] poof. it looked like right. before the atom bomb got re where you really. started to worry you know. like you'd see an explosion. be like whoa that's big. and then you're like wait a second. oh that's what her hair. was it just got that. big before it [ __ ] mushroom clouded. um so yeah so that's what it. looks like let's find out. her name her name is going. to be something i am the devil. let's go a little bit back. because when you do a when you play something and you stu. and you stop it and then you talk about a little bit and then you play. it on a podcast and then you don't realize you're at the part. where the ladies said i am. the devil you gotta go. back you gotta go back. and you gotta say what the [ __ ] she was talking about my bad for talking sometimes. you know sometimes you know. what i mean that happens. especially like in relationships. when i'm with kristen a lot of times we'll be. talking and i'll be saying something and then she'll talk over. me and then i'll be like oops. right because the sentence. never ends in my and that was the last. word i said right. so if that was the last word. i said my then what happened. then i guess maybe i got cut off right. and we shouldn't be doing that. should we and then she goes chris. and i say okay. so can i go back. and she says okay and then guess what i forgot. what the [ __ ] i was gonna say yes dude yes had to. lay down the law in the process of laying down. the law he forgot what. he said which is fine. because you need to. lay down the law a. lot in a relationship all good. but it's real love real love oh i'm searching. for a real life someone whatever. real love just [ __ ] i could be in that group i was six when it came out so uh what did she say. you heard i am the devil. they heard the toaster voice. did the devil have um a very low. voice i'd say sounded. like eli wallach wow dude. the toaster had a very low. voice that sounded like eli. wallach the cool thing. about this podcast is when i wake up. in the morning i never know. about the sentences that. will be coming out of my mouth. later on in the day and the one that shocked me. so far is the toaster. had a low voice that sounded. like eli wallach but i ended up saying it. if you had woke me up. this morning and said hey chris guess what your guess. what you're going to. either say or hear today. and i said what and you said the toaster. had a low voice that sounded. like eli wallach i would think one. thing it must be podcast. day it must be podcast. day and it is who's eli. wallace anyway i got to. look him up eli i. definitely heard the name before. wow imagine the toaster eli. wallach when did he die. why we lived long well. he lived in to. be 99. what does he sound. like let's see eli. wallace voice here we go. eli wallace why he's always plays. the bad guy okay. so he played a toaster i have. a feeling that the first imprint. you make on him as a child. i used to. see these movies where the heaven. was heating no are you at all. concerned that today people are a little bit. aware of what violence in. films is doing and here. you are good bad and the ugly. as mean and vicious a performance. and a thesis as as could be imagined. yes but you see when you say violence. this is how we sound i don't think there's anything more violent. than what's happening in the world. today yeah okay but that's not the question. let's talk about that well okay. that's what eli wallace sounded. like dude maybe some subway. the metro yeah it took 20. minutes this is what the toasters are after i finished. working i had my makeup on i'm sitting in the subway. not even that evil. hey toast is done all right. so let's go back to. this thing i gotta [ __ ] let's go back. to this thing here let's think it. let's see what the [ __ ] this lady's getting. at saved any of this. satanic toast yes i did save it. because i wanted to. be sure that somebody else would see. it now this one can you see. that richard see ah the toast has an imprint that. says satan lives uh just eat it. dude it says satan. lives she did it hey june o'brien. you did it hey you're trying. to trick us that satan's in the toaster. also how about the ego. you gotta have to. think even if she was being serious. the ego you gotta have to. think my toaster is haunted. but it's not just a demon. satan's at my house that's unreal. to be like my house. is the one that satan comes. to what about his you. know what i mean what are they called. evil archangels what about the [ __ ] fallen angels what. about them huh your house. is so [ __ ] dope with the with the with the uh periwinkle. wallpaper satan showed up. to that one you think satan. doesn't like comfort satan. is the [ __ ] dude in the underworld. sorry god but you know. what i mean when i was a kid. i used to. say swear words and [ __ ] and then i would go sorry god i'd look up in the air. and i'd say sorry god. as if god was up. there looking down at me. like this i'll send [ __ ] satan down to. your toaster dude that was. my ocd people somebody asked me. the other day when did you know. you had ocd and i said well it [ __ ] for sure flared its head when it was when i was in my early. 20s and he said oh really. and i said yeah but there were always signs. and he was like like what and should have said that. whenever i said a swear. word i looked up and said sorry. god now that's just as ridiculous. as thinking satan's cooking. your sandwiches but however remember when you used to. write an essay in high school. and you just it needed. to be a certain amount. of words and you just every other sentence. was however so you'd be like [ __ ] that's 16. however i got [ __ ] 16 words right. there i would do it and uh when i exhaled. my nose snot came out. but then it went back. in it was like when jeff. bezos went to. space he got up there. a little bit and then whoa. okay cool and then dipped out. that's what my [ __ ] boogie. did this is clicking around. um so uh my my audio's clicking. around yes that's amazing. so um so yeah so satan. lives with this it's just the ego. people have to. think that like for even for me. as as a sixyearold when i would say. sorry god or even as an 11yearold. to say sorry god to. [ __ ] be like okay but that's something an elevenyearold does. but this woman is a fullfledged adult. saying hey to. believe let's say she does. believe this she's not. trying to trick people which i think she is. trying to trick people to. think that we're not the like we're such big. idiots that we don't think. that you do that you did. that and tried to. trick us as one thing. but to if we say we you thought. we believed you still what about. your [ __ ] ego that satan. is at your house also satan. lives that's how he's gonna say it. in your toast you think satan. can't pick up a [ __ ] marker. you think satan can't. [ __ ] find where your lipstick is and write it on your mirror. he's gonna he's gonna burn. your bread he's gonna burn. it in your bread dude. it's so annoying when people think that ghosts. and [ __ ] are real i got a buddy that literally was like i said to. him i was like do you believe in that. [ __ ] all that paranormal [ __ ] and he says oh 100 and i was like why and he said oh dude i [ __ ] cause i know it does because because it happened to. me once and i said really something. irrefutable and he was like 100. and i said well what is it. and i said and dude. keep it short and he said okay. i'll try i swear to. god it took an hour. kristen he was doing voice. notes because i was like don't text. is going to take too. long he was doing voice. notes kristen at 45. minutes and she was like what. the [ __ ] what are you listening. to it was him. telling me how one time. he moved into an apartment. in [ __ ] los angeles and like his his car had a boot on it and then a tire was missing and then like it looked like there was burnt. wallpaper and then hair in his bathtub. and he thought it was the guy. that used to. live here that [ __ ] killed himself. and i'm like that's not your beautiful. irrefutable evidence man this.

make this a clip show. i know you guys do like it. next is richard schwartz such a city. council named richard schwartz. good afternoon afternoon oh you could tell she's already pissed um before you start the clock. could you stop it for a second it's real. discouraging to come up. here and see all the heads. down it's it's like you're on a twominute. timer here so let's go. app oh absolute slam unreal. absolute sl sir you're wasting valuable. seconds yeah in two minutes. first of all he came in just everyone in this. situation is already mad okay. well i'm gonna go up. there but their heads. are down if their heads are down when i get up. there you know i gotta have to. say something because you know how i am right. yeah and she was like i'm having the most [ __ ] annoying awful day i swear to. god if one person stammers that's docking. their points already oh he's incredulous. right i'm not following you. oh he does he does. he does because i do that. move too he does. follow her because i do that. move too and i know. that move when when you know. they're when they're making sense. but they're not being nice i'm sorry. i don't follow you what's going. on because there's a protocol here you're supposed. to be nice to. somebody and i'm being nice to. you and i'm just casually kind of seeing. what's up and you're not being nice. so no i don't follow. you so why don't we rewind. time a little bit like superman. did it when he flew around. the world hmm my own. super memory in that [ __ ] christopher reeves. movie superman when he flew around. the world you didn't know how he was gonna save the day. because [ __ ] lois already died. so he flew around. the world backwards and he reversed. time so why don't we get superman. to do that because i don't follow. you you're on a two minute. timer slam him again could you start it over please. no we're not going to. just go ahead just so so angry. so it was unreasonable. for you to ask. that people look up and give me their attention. sir you have two minutes. we're all looking at you. have two minutes now you have a minute. and 30 seconds unreal. okay well i guess i won't be able. to say it um last week. you limited uh this kind of goes. to the heart of what i was going. to talk about which was the state of our democracy. all right you've got one minute. left oh [ __ ] dude goes our state of our democracy. the woman goes so rude. so rude with a robot limited. speakers because of the number of speakers. to one minute each but you allowed. uh camilla jayapal to. speak as long as you wanted. to it was four. or five minutes and it. reminded me of uh george orwell's famous. saying from animal farm about how all animals. are equal but some animals are more equal than others. i feel like i'm being treated now. just because i fortyfive seconds kind of asking for your attention. like i noticed you all. were very attentive to. miss jayapal the other last week. i just wanted to. ask your attention before. i started and i immediately got a hostile. response back from you i don't understand that so you don't ever respond. to citizens or what. i do sir but you have two minutes. for public comment to. the agenda items oh man i remember on tape. and i think it's a it's a pretty. sad commentary that you think that asking for you guys to. look up off of your computers. and give attention during this. short period of time. was an unreasonable thing. i really feel bad about that. thank you damn dude. that's [ __ ] up dude but also some audiences are hard dude. some audiences are hard. dude that's why you get those.

because your boy's all lumped. up dude not just in his pockets. but he's all lumped the [ __ ] up oops. whoops your boy's lumped up. oops your boy's got a turtle back. yeah [ __ ] worked on my lats. earlier dude it's insane my [ __ ] [ __ ] i look like one of those [ __ ] what are you i i i walk down the street somebody's like is that a [ __ ] huge flying squirrel no it's just me dude i got lats it's crazy i'm like one of those guys who [ __ ] dude the other day i went to. go do a one of those you know those guys who [ __ ] go through. the who cares this. is not even a good. bit who even gives a [ __ ] it's not. even a good bit it's fine. it's just kind of is what it. is i've been trying to. curb my [ __ ] ocd it's tough man. i don't want my my son. to see it and then think that you got to. do it you know it's a lot. i met another guy with ocd. and we were talking about it. and he was like it. really opened up to. me and it was like crazy. his you know his rituals to. me were like wow that's that's bad. and then i was sharing. my rituals and it's like mine. are [ __ ] bad too just in a different way. and it's just like it's hard. to [ __ ] deal with because you know it's fake like and it's so too like something that helps me actually with my ocd. is i think about how egotistical it. is like let's go back. to the lady with the toaster. who thought she was so the [ __ ] that satan. was at her house if i walk onto. the plane wrong i think it's gonna crash. you understand but how egotistical is that. i'm in control of everybody. on this plane's life what about the way. they entered the plane. no it's all about me. you know it's so egotistical. that helps me in a way. because i think like oh that's [ __ ] i'm just another person. on this world i got to. relax my ego's out. of control that i you know. my ocd if i don't [ __ ] throw this snapple bottle away right. then you know my mom's gonna get cancer. or some [ __ ] when there's no medic metaphysical proof. like that of course it. doesn't have that happen but like you know. that that's not the truth. because i control people's lives [ __ ] all that so that helps me a little bit if you have ocd that you should think about try to. think about it that way. between that and a little bit of medication. i'm able to [ __ ] because i i i was with my my [ __ ] my exwife my first wife um and she was like your ocd. is getting out of control. you should you should take medication. and i was like i'm not in my head. i was like i'm never taking medication. until it starts affecting my work and then one time. i decided one time i was at i was gonna go on stage. at the improv and i was so stressed out. with my ocd and i couldn't stop thinking about my rituals that i was like you know. what dude it was right. before i went on stage. and i went on stage. all like buzzing and like [ __ ] up in my own. head because of ocd and i was like i'm just gonna actually i'm just gonna actually start. taking medication the next day. i started taking medication. dude the next day i had pills. already that i didn't take. and i started taking them and i never looked. back to it and it does. help the medication with the like you know i read about it. and i also have done some behavioral. therapy at one time i took a uh um i went to. behavioral therapy uh and this guy was just like i went to. him to see him. a few times and he was like you know. what could work for you. and i was like what just take the so what approach. so what if it happens. i'm just like huh. and he was like i was like you tell me. if i sm throw the [ __ ] snap a bottle away so what. my mom's gonna die. of cancer and he was like yeah. now it's just like gargano. dark so anyway man. it's been a long way. but that [ __ ] [ __ ] flares up. when you're 22 23. so i was like how when did it flare up. for you to the my new buddy. and he was like yeah 22. he was like i was like there. you go but there were always signs. you know like i said like the sorry. god [ __ ] or that i lined up my car. my matchbox cars and my uncle vinnie. would come over and he would be like hey what's this. one and i'm like no you don't take them. out you don't
