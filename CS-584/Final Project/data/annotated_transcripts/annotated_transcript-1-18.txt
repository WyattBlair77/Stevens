 i just think about this. cat williams thing and i'm just like people. are like dude hell yeah. cat williams telling the truth. you know telling the talking [ __ ] about everyone right. he's talking [ __ ] about kevin hart. he's talking talking [ __ ] about joe rogan. he's talking [ __ ] about uh cedric the entertainer. steve harvey i mean dude. every even people that had no business. he's talking [ __ ] about just like and like i i i think kevin i think uh cat will is [ __ ] hysterical but everyone there are people that are just like oh dude he's a hero. he speaks the truth thank god. somebody's saying it dude you can't you can't have first of all my favorite. thing that he said was that. uh kevin hart was a plant. an industry plant which everyone's. like knew it dude. ever since soul plane dude. you cannot be a [ __ ] plant a hollywood. plant you as a comedian. people are either laughing. with you or not i guess. if you're in industry and someone if if in the music industry and someone just picks you to. make an album i is that. a plan like what even is a plan. a plan is something that can only be secretly a spy. it's like a government plan or a plant. pl like a plant. in a house can be a pl. you can't be a plant. if you're what that what does that. mean the the the industry just picked you to. be in movies that's what it. is that's what acting is h. h who what does it mean. unless kevin hart is an undercover. cia agent right unless he's his actually unless he's actually his character. in central intelligence never saw. it sometime you know the big rock. little johnson movie with the [ __ ] i don't know if he was the cia. guy probably the rock was but cuz the rock. looks like the rock um but dude. he's not a plant. because of obviously and here's the thing. is that people are just like hell yeah. speaking the truth but really he's just speaking. he's just being funny. i don't like how i don't like how comics are [ __ ] [ __ ] dude like they're [ __ ] live and let live i saw a black comedian say uh online like yo how come black comedians only are the only comedians that tear down other black comedians white comedians don't do it i'm like bro. i almost wrote to him. lol like they're just it's it's it's so it's such it's such [ __ ] [ __ ] to. be doing that [ __ ] and i like cat. williams i never met. him i never met. him but he's funny. as [ __ ] though actually let's let's go to. this let's talk about the the cat. williams thing and let's let's play. the clip i meant to. play it earlier. of course this isn't working there. we go [music] um on let's talk. about uh here we go. oh this this are you related. to uh luda no um related. to the crossroads where we were both. invited to an illuminati. thing and it had to. be one or the other of us. and decisions had to. be made so it was both. of us we were equal. one of us had to. cut off all their hair. and couldn't do the sideburn thing. no more with the points and the next. person they said was going. to get $200 million because they were going. to pay him 10. million a movie to. do 20 movies and that's how the conversation. happened one of those persons. turned out to be ludicrous. and the other person turned out. to be cat williams. bro they don't do that. yeah he has the the he has those and he want to. shave it but what i don't get is. like he's breaking it. down like hey hollywood execs come. up and they they hey dude you know. what we got to. get ludicrous and cat williams. in here now there's a part that's great. for only either of them. you know what i mean. hey luda hey cat so. look we're thinking of making 20. movies like this is not how it works. we're thinking of making 20. movies about cars now. check this out the first one. it's going to. be fine the second one. little crazy by the time. i get to like seven. cars are going to. be going outer space it's going. to be bonkers and very bad. we want to. give you one of you. $200 million upf front to. be in 20 of these movies. but the key to. it is you got to. shave who want i know one. of you wants it and one of you. doesn't so what's it going. to be and ludicrous was like i'll do it. and cat williams was like yeah. cuz i won't also there's never been 20. sequels of anything you know i don't even know if there's 20. james bond movies let's keep going. with this interview now one. person ended up with a lightskinned. ugly faed wife that's never done. a remember i told you that. if i say that it. apply to seven people. it's part of what they give you okay. i didn't get it i'm not mad. about it how much money. they give 200 sir fast. and furious is on. what number right now want a me. i might need get me. one of more women look say that's what they all. end up saying at the end. of the day i just don't know. look at he's talking [ __ ] about everybody yeah that's what he said ludicrous. wife's ugly kevin told you it. won't go wear no dress. until they offered him the dress. and then he put it on what did. he say after i made my own. decision duh but you didn't make it before they brought it up. did you it's okay. it's all right for a fiveyear. period every single movie that kevin hart. did was a movie that had been on my desk. that all i had said was just can we take some of this. step and fetches [ __ ] out and then i can do it like it don't need to. be overtly homosexual cuz i'm not homosexual. right it doesn't need that. funny right there's truth in this. me saying that and them. going oh yeah no problem. and then going to. give it to. this other guy and having him. do it just like it. was and acting like i'm a bad. person because i keep standing on my standard. but i mean all that's yeah. that could be true. you know cu it's like dude. they give you the script. they want you to. do what they want to. do but but what i don't understand. is hey i don't want to. and this is not just cat. williams this is like like people. think this oh dude. i don't want to. like people think that if you do a roll. with a dress on as a man. then oh they got you you're in the illuminati. like i and they also talk about how black actors black actors talk. about how black actors do it. bro every single white movie star. has dressed in a dress. in a movie every single one. who pick one schwarzenegger done. it uh i don't know i'm just saying random. ones you know michael douglas. probably done it bruce willis. michael keaton they all done it. it is cheap though you know. um but my favorite thing was this. ludicrous responded in a freestyle which is by the way. by the way i think that that's the right. way to do it. because because first of all it doesn't seem like you're serious. about it it seems like you're having fun. and also you're ludicrous so who gives a [ __ ] you know but look this. was the frey whatever's heavy. on my heart is always on my mind. like snoop's cannabis shredder i'm always on. my grind they throwing shade cuz [ __ ] could never take my shine. i bring my watch collection. on myet let me take myne i'm aging. like benjamin so far this. is just has nothing to. do with cat williams you. know that's okay the pendulum. swing jesus with diamond thorns. ludicrous swaddled in gucci. linens when i was born illuminati. only aud and there we go. now that is quite possibly. the worst hiphop bar. i've ever heard in my life. not never illuminati only udina naughty. wow dude only now married with kids the evolution of life. never been a clout chaser. never say [ __ ] for likes rip. john singleton you never have to. flex when you earn every one of your fast. and furious checks afro with the side. burs i mean you know. what does earn mean. in this situation show up to. work ludicrous goes like this. is ludicrous oh him in f. yeah that's myans [music]. nice i am not. a luda fan but i'm i'm. happy he did that 9.3 million. views [music] crazy
