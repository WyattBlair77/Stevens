walk in close to. the apple store or did i walk in as far as possible. and then i have to. walk the whole mall and realize i could have parked closer. you do the math guess. have you ever have you ever. by mistake parked to. the place that you meant. to go if you want. to go to [ __ ] the food. court maybe if you want to. go to food court because there. are signs from it. from outside and you can kind of sense. where it is from the outside. right there's lots of like pigeons. outside but if you want to. go to the apple store. and it's not bloomingdales or macy's. right because those are on the edges always but in the middle. all the other [ __ ] orange. julius [ __ ] apple always. a j crew in the mall. if you don't have a j crew. in the mall you ain't [ __ ] unless you have a banana republic. but if you're a great mall. you got em both. okay walked in i go. where's the apple store immediately. my mall senses started tingling and i walked directly where i wasn't because life. doesn't work out that way it's always far. out so i go to. the i'm walking and i'm walking. and i'm just sensing and then i look on the [ __ ] you are here thing. and sure enough i was the furthest.

you trip on it's a hazard you're stupid that's why sometimes it's just [ __ ] he just throws all the insults those other like the the the slams and just immediate name calling which is my favorite thing you know they cut out all the [ __ ] bad [ __ ] too like now there could never be a gordon ramsay now this [ __ ] he started like 2005 was when he started getting famous or something never now that's because you're a [ __ ] it would be like this is a test but he um i i [ __ ] the first episode is hilarious dude season one it's hell on wheels and he goes and he [ __ ] basically goes undercover because people know he's gordon ramsey so he goes undercover he gets like it's like the [ __ ] somebody in hollywood puts makeup all on him and he'll go in as like a [ __ ] longshoreman that's american and with a hat on on a phone and he goes and sits down in waters and they give him food and there's like people from like across the way like filming him and he's eating the like let's get the oyster he's got people with them because they order because they'll recognize his voice and the oysters get everything a bunch of different [ __ ] and then he starts eating it and then and then and and and my favorite thing is he'll [ __ ] spit it out like how many times in your life have you spit out food in any restaurant ever zero zero zero times you just [ __ ] suck it up and eat it
