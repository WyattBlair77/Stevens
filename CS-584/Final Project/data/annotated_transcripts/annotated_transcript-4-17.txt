that i am living through. this too early christmas. and i'm gonna stop this from getting. out of hand on the podcast. i'm not gonna talk to. you about the christmas. even though i've been talking about for five. minutes i'm gonna stop right. now because i don't wanna. subject you guys to. that and that's how much that's how much i respect the people. that listen to. this podcast okay now you know your book. keeps it super disrespectful right. but i keep it super disrespectful. and that's what makes it. respectful right because i'm being me. and you get a little slice. of me right okay. and that's fine and that's great. but i would never stoop solo as to. subjected to christmas. too early now here what we're gonna do. because we're gonna have a christmas. episode later we'll do that but that's fine. but um but yeah so um so instead of that. let's talk about this i was out. today and um i was getting. uh no as a matter of fact. i was waiting in line. to get a a piece of food. i was trying to. get it something to. eat it was a i don't know probably something. like a protein bowl. because of how [ __ ] ridiculously [ __ ] stacked i am and uh yeah dude i eat bread sometimes. but usually just late at night. and then the day i keep it. really [ __ ] lean i'm practically a trout and so i [ __ ] so i i was waiting in line for the [ __ ] um for the protein bowl or something like that i don't know maybe they were just handing me a [ __ ] whole. salmon i can't even remember but i keep it. so lean dude and so uh i can't remember what he was giving me maybe just a [ __ ] head of lettuce i can't remember but dude i was keeping it so lean it was ridiculous and i was waiting in line for it and this guy comes up to. me and i [ __ ] park. my car on a hill. okay now what do you do. i don't i don't want to. know what's legal or what the rules. are in that situation i wanted. i want to. know how i feel about it. right i had the car facing up. the hill all right. now when the car is facing up. the hill i gotta go. off of feeling right. i have to go. off of feeling for which way. i turn the wheel all right. i have to do. that now let me tell you why. i have to do. that all right because either way. either way i turn the car. wheel either way it's gonna be fine. as long as i turn it. okay now if it's straight and there's no car. behind me whoopsie daisy there's a roller coaster. and a [ __ ] really nice car. it's just gonna just cause it's gonna be rolling down. the [ __ ] street and people are gonna have to. dive out the way. like paper boi right and that's just facts. where's the cap okay. so as long as you turn the wheel. a certain way right. say this is the sidewalk. and this is the car. okay now this was my car. facing up if i turn the wheel. this way all right. what's it do let's just say. the brakes give out whoopsiedaisy the back. hits it right the backs hit. the curve the back hits. the ground now you don't want the back. to hit the curt but whoopsie. daisy if it happens right. and also whoopsie daisy if there's a car behind it. maybe whoopsie daisy hits the car. but everyone's fine though right. the cars get all dented. up and smashed but it's just a fender bender. and nobody dies okay now let's say you turn the wheels. this way right now whoopsie. that's nice whoopsie daisy nobody gets. hurt right whoopsie daisy it's just the tires. that hit it but you got to. be really close you got to. be really [ __ ] close and let's let's let's all when you park. like this dude and you're just perpendicular. you know you're you know you don't know. if you're close enough especially if you've got a nice car. anybody's got a nice car. so if i do it like this. and i know maybe i'm not close. enough then guess what could possibly. happen whoopsie daisy and we've got a whole street. massacre okay everyone's got to. get hit and i'll lump the [ __ ] up and die. and i might hit two cars. on the way this one and then that one. all right but the law. says and i know this you got to. do it like this okay. the law says you got to. do it like this so whoopsie daisy. it's just the tire that's touching. the side of the curb. crisis averted but i'm thinking more. of the what if i didn't park. close enough because i'm second guessing. myself and that's a good thing. right you got to. be confident in your life. but when it comes to. other people that you could. kill you got to. second guess yourself right otherwise if you don't and they die. you go oh i was living my life. and because of the way i lived. a bunch of people got ran. over all right now just follow. me that's the law but what your boy. does is he decides. to go at like do it. like this all right. so when the car goes boom. it hits the curb fine. might hit the back the car. behind me all good i am. willing to get a ticket. for that that thing right. there all right because i will pay if i hit the guy's back. the front of that. car and my car i'll go. through insurance or whatever the [ __ ] you know but i think the law should be this way right but it's not it's this way i always park it this way come get me okay i'm admitting right now in stereo live in that ass i go this way come get me all right so i do that i get out of my car i walk over to. get in line i'm probably getting. like a full [ __ ] i don't even know. i'm probably just getting literally like stripped boars. meat and i can't remember but you know. i keep it lean right. so i'm getting something super lean. and this guy comes up. to me and he says hey man. you parked the wrong way. i'm samaran right but i'm cool right. i breathe i breathe. instead of simmer but i'm still simmering. but i'm breathing too right. and i look at him. and i say what and the what even. though that's what i said i said the word. what the context of it. and he felt it was why. would you say that to. me right he felt the you can kind of bend the word. to what you want it's like when eminem rhymes door. hinge with orange you know what i mean. doran's to orange you got an orange. orange right that's what i do. when i'm talking to. strangers that are out of pocket. stranger wants to come. up jumping out of a pocket. to me i could bend my word. to me and whatever the [ __ ] it wants i could say i love you but in real life you hear get the [ __ ] out of here because i've got acting in me corner you understand all right. so i know how to. bend my sentences to. the feeling of the word. dude okay do i swear. to god if krista was in this. room listening right now she would be nodding. her head back and forth so much. that it would turn around. like the exorcist so i say. to him what and he says you have to. make it go to. where it's you know. pointing the other way so when it comes. down the the tire just catches the curb. and i don't say anything. because i like for guys to. sometimes sit in what they just said so i just stare at them. and i say after a few beats. uh oh like that like that. like uh oh like a crunch with my eyes. and he goes like this. ah you know i you probably don't care. ab and walks away dude. [ __ ] yeah man that's a ko. [music] that's it [ __ ] you do it. dude that's a k. the [ __ ] oh man that's a ko. dude your boy kills it. with them conversational kos dude come at me. which way am i supposed. to park i'll scrunch up. my eyes and say why. and you'll leave all dark. [ __ ] yeah man oh i love [ __ ] like that man ah you probably don't care you know what the best part. was i saw him swallow. himself he goes like this. ah and when he goes it. was the thing where it was like he so he says the thing. he says is oh uh you probably don't care. and it was right. here when he did freeze right. there he was like there. i was i realized i was that. guy and then it unfrozen dude. he realized he was that guy. swallowed himself and [ __ ] yeah dude technical freaking knockout. by your boy johnny. keeps it lean dude. we have [ __ ] two we have two now dude this [ __ ] keeps firing on all syllables. wasn't sure if i was gonna get in the thick. of it started the podcast. i am extremely in the thick. of it dude you guys. are here you guys are listening. and i want you to. know i [ __ ] love you dude. i love you with my balls. and that's stronger than your heart.

you. okay you don't understand. like dude the people the way. people lived in the in the 1600s. they were lopping each other's heads off for like believing. in witches if anyone did that. now they'd immediately get incarcerated. right there would even be a trial. they'd be like lock him. up he locked off somebody. for believing something right but that you don't. know how you would be back. in 1620 because you didn't grow. up in 1620 and that goes. for people who are from you. know los angeles and then there's people from st. louis and then there's people from vancouver there's people from

you don't do that right you literally just sit and you think well that person's a [ __ ] [ __ ] because of the way that they are and the way that it's not about what happened to. them that's that's one of the things. it's like when you when something happens. to you and it's unjust. or shitty you think hey [ __ ] that thing that happened to. me but if you see someone else act a certain way. that you might even act you don't. think hey i wonder what happened. to that guy you think that person's a [ __ ] [ __ ] and that is incongruous think about that for everyone dude. i got some empathy

[ __ ] country gunslinger right um and you can be any kind of guy that you want in this game. it's an open world. video game you can go and you can literally stab everybody. murder horses kill rabbits. and not even pick up. their pelt for [ __ ] to. sell right you can just go on a murdering. spree but it brings your honor. way down and that's what i did. in the beginning of the game. because i thought it was fun. i lived i lived for arthur morgan. i was selfcentered the beginning. of that red dead redemption game. i was doing that and then i realized halfway. through i started dreaming of wolves. like i mentioned i started. dreaming of wolves and somebody. in the chat said you know. what if you get your honor. up you start dreaming of deer. and i was like well that's interesting. i was like well why. would i [ __ ] why would i get my honor. up and half the people. in the chat were like it's not. that fun if you play. with your honor up. and some people are like it's actually cool. because the ending is better. so it's like whatever so i started. feeling like you know what i want. to take this game seriously. i mean totally [ __ ] dork. [ __ ] like it's actually more fun if you seriously take this game and actually play it for for real uh it's actually much more fun and it actually it makes you feel a lot better. at the end you get the better. ending so i'm playing this game it just makes me laugh people go out there and just stabbing horses for no reason i just don't see what it benefits what does it examine in the human race so um i'm playing the game and i start to. change my honor i'm saying. how did everybody on the streets. like i mentioned i start. [ __ ] doing side missions. i start getting my honor. up my honor get so some people are now. joining on the twitch. again and they're like whoa. you got your honor. way up what the [ __ ] going on so in the middle of the game somebody. coughs on you you don't. think much of it it's actually more in the beginning. of the game somebody coughs. on you you're going to. bully him for money. that he owes you. and he coughs on. you you don't even think of much. much of it at all. there comes a time in the moment. in the game where you just faint. and you fall down and then the doctor says hey guess what you have. tuberculosis now back then. tuberculosis was a death. sentence in the 1800s this. game takes place it was a death sentence. so you're gonna die. in this game now. i'm like well dude i gotta win. the game before i die. as the game goes on. arthur morgan keeps coughing more and more he's just coughing more. and more he keeps coughing i'm like this. [ __ ] sucks my character. just keeps [ __ ] coughing it sucks. and in a way it. was like now i'm playing with this. character and i've got the disease and i just want to. fight these [ __ ] but he keeps stopping and coughing and [ __ ] and i realize because one of the guys in the chat on twitch. says you know how you got tuberculosis and i said. how he said cause that. guy coughed on you i said is there. any way to avoid it and he said. nah it's part of the narrative of the game. so i realized it. was predestined that this character. was gonna die and i've already got my honor. good i went from a derelict. to a good person. in this game and i was gonna [ __ ] die. anyway so i get upset. i get upset at the game. you know i'm a bit of a nihilist. myself but arthur morgan it's not even me so i'm playing this game and i don't even get to. be the supernaturalist i want to. be in this virtual game so i look at the save point. you know you could save. and when you save the game. it tells you how much of the game you're completed. and i'm at about 60. and arthur is [ __ ] dying all right. and i'm like how bad does. it get because you can't. cure tuberculosis what happens. well all of your friends. in the game red dead redemption they backstab. you and you're on the run. and you're running from the cops. and the people who are supposed. to save you and back. you up they [ __ ] backstab. you they sell you out and you end. up getting shot at stumbling over. rocks and it's not looking good. for arthur morgan aka me. so one of the other homies. in my posse comes. up and he's always been a good. guy in the game and he says you doing all right. and arthur morgan me says you know. what i'm not gonna make it i'll hold. them off while you get away. and the guy says i can't do that. jim mar mars marsden jim. marsden i think whatever the [ __ ] i still don't. really know um but he was like uh i'm not gonna let you do that. and arthur says it would make me. happy if you let me save you and you go right. so he gives him the satchel that arthur morgan. has to jim and he gives him. his guns and he takes his hat. off and he puts. his hat on jim and arthur says leave me here. and you're basically just arthur morgan. now no satchel which by the way. has all my [ __ ] that i've collected. in the game throughout the game it. has in his satchel right. i gave it away. to some [ __ ] [ __ ] side character. and now i don't have it. anymore and i got to. fight off this [ __ ] these bad guys which are actually the you know the [ __ ] the cops and so he's shooting he's shooting these [ __ ] and uh there's no no way out of it you fall on a rock and you start breathing and you breathe your last breath and arthur morgan dies and i realize now there's 60 percent of the game left and there's nothing i could have done but he died and he died and he was dreaming. of deer the whole time. he turned it around and he redeemed. himself into a good. person and i got the good ending. but there's still 60 percent of the game. left and i realized that when arthur morgan. says hey you know. get out of here you now. become this other character. for the rest of the 35 of the game all. right and it's [ __ ] emotional dude. it's like emotional it's not. like a video game like tecmo bowl. where they're like right. it's emotional like the music. happens and it's a beautiful. song not even just score it's somebody. singing like it was a beautiful. it's like you they have youtube. on it or some [ __ ] and i'm just like this. isn't even like the rest of the game. at all this is beautiful. the sun's peeking out over. as arthur morgan's taking his last breath. and in this moment. calvin walks in and calvin goes. to climb up on my chair. and as he goes to. climb up on my chair. he falls and hits his head. and just starts wailing because he hurt. he hurt himself and he i said. oh no buddy and i pick. him up and i'm watching [ __ ] arthur morgan or somebody [ __ ] maybe i'm the new guy now and i'm riding into. the sunset and the music's blaring. and i'm calvin is crying. and i say it's okay. buddy everyone falls down but the worst. part is over and now you can move. on from that and with the music. and calvin's crying and now i'm crying. because i'm telling calvin something. that's you know like personal. to me and i'm living this.
