[ __ ] uh before i'm over here. taking this [ __ ] show for a jog that's what i'm saying. before i'm up here taking this episode. for a [ __ ] brisk walk i [ __ ] cut my [ __ ] i got another beard trimmer because what happens is they keep breaking if you don't have a beard. trimmer that keeps breaking you ain't. really trimming your beard now. are you so i did it. and now there's a piece of hair. right here somewhere and it keeps poking me in the collarbone. ah yes dude is it the most. annoying thing yes dude but do we keep rolling. we do but it's so [ __ ] annoying because it's basically just like this is what it's doing the whole time the whole. time i can't figure out where it. is and it's pissing me. off yes dude here's a here's a hair. but did i get it. i got it but that's probably not the right. one ah yes dude constant annoyance. you have to. when you shave when you cut when you trim. your [ __ ] you got to. go directly into the i don't know if chicks know this i don't know if women know this as a man when you cut your beard. what you got to. do immediately after that is dive. into a pool otherwise you're [ __ ] dude. hairs are everywhere all. the time all in your neck. i mean yeah it kind of happens. when you get your hair. cut when you sit in that. chair and you get the hair cut but mostly what it. does mostly what happens. is when you cut your beard. you got to take a shower. immediately right after or dive. into a river. you got to sit you know. what you got to. do okay you got to. get under a waterfall and just [ __ ] let it cascade all over your [ __ ] where it glistens. over your chest and [ __ ] you know over those [ __ ] over that washboard tommy because we all have those but yeah dude uh we're here and we're doing it and uh we got that [ __ ] another with chris episode is up hiking. it's [ __ ] doing stupid number it's dude. it's doing [ __ ] stupid numbies dude. so anyway we do stupid. numbies that's what we do here um so you activate. that algorithm and help. out and like just destroy that [ __ ] one and dine that like button you know what i mean but whatever dude um i did i cut my beard and a little bit and uh you know i don't know what length to. keep it you know i didn't realize during the pandemic. i let it grow really. really long and the kind of that. became the thing and then i saw a picture. of me like three years. ago and i kept it. kind of cool i kept it. kind of like clean there. i just kept it like peeking. out like the second day. of chia pet like i kind of just kept it. like a little bit peeking. out like all my hairs and my cheeks were doing it like without like opening. a door like what's going on like that's how it was like did so did i hear something like that's how my my hair was coming out. and then during the pandemic. i just kind of let it. just grow and uh now this is kind of the style. but it's getting real gray. dude i know your boy's young. as [ __ ] but it's getting real gray. oh and it was my birthday. i'm 42 now and it was also april uh first that it was april. fools uh and everyone thinks that my new podcast. with my brother coming out. called lifeline is an april fool's. joke but it's not an april fool's. joke it's a real podcast called. lifeline with my brother matalia. so go to the lifeline. over there and like and subscribe. and be ready for that. [ __ ] to drop enough. with the promo though dude. i don't even mean to. be doing promos it's just i got a lot. of stuff going on in my in my life. and i need to. promo it i guess right. like i told you i did the [ __ ] the with chris stuff. the new lifeline i cut my beard. this is all promo [ __ ] but um yeah and now we're just chilling and we are just chilling saw a dude the other day at a coffee shop that i haven't seen i tell you what i think it you get to. 30 late 30s is when if you've been in the same place. like this geographically in the same. place in your late 30s. uh and you're in your late. 30s what happens is it's very weird. in your late 20s and even in your early. 30s if you see somebody if you see somebody and you hang out with them for like a year or something and then you see them 10 years later they look roughly the same but when you start seeing people 20 years later they start looking like [ __ ] old renditions of themselves and old versions of themselves and that's what's crazy like i saw i used to. you know i used to. set up shop at this. [ __ ] coffee bean. when i used to. run that block over on ventura. and coldwater now i don't go. there anymore what happened. is the [ __ ] place shut down and everybody that i used to. see at that coffee shop. dispersed into different. coffee shops you know. some of them go to. the cold water coffee bean. on whitsett some of them. go to [ __ ] aroma cafe. some of them go over. to the coffee fix some of them. go over to one over on sunset i mean. these guys are out there. we're out there right. we're out there we're all out. there it's like we went through. some [ __ ] it's like uh the movie stand. by me and we all got together. later on right or it you know nothing. really horrific happened except for the coffee. bean shut down but we all see each other. now and i see these guys and i see them. 20 years later it is insane to. see these dudes 20 years. later because that's when you realize life just keeps going unless you die. right life just keeps going if you don't get cancer. or get hit by a bus or suffer. a heart attack or you're too fat. and [ __ ] basically just choke on yourself. life just keeps going and you get to. see people and the only thing that remains. the same are basically their eyes. right because i don't like to. say this and i don't say this. but the eyes are the windows. to the soul right that's not something. that i say a lot. you know we keep it. light hearted and joking in this congratulations podcast but lest we forget eyes they're the windows. to the soul you know so it doesn't matter. how old or how fat or skinny. you know hair losing people get less. we forget the eyes they're the windows. to the soul and when these guys. see when i see them. in a new coffee shop. because this is where i always see. them in a new coffee shop. that i happen to. roll into and i'm a medullo. of course but then these guys come in and they look. like fat old versions of themselves. but then i see their eyes. and i'm like oh 20. years later but lest we forget. eyes are the windows to. the soul and i wonder what the [ __ ] they've been up. to because i forget about these [ __ ] until i see him what has this dude been doing for 20. years isn't that [ __ ] crazy it's a reminder. that life keeps going and you got to. just kind of i don't know. it made me feel some sort of poignant like. thing because i'm like well life. keeps going but you kind of got to. just kind of keep being true. to yourself and keep doing your [ __ ] you know all these dudes i just see them at coffee. shops but you got to. just keep doing you and if doing you is going. and being happy getting that [ __ ] coffee. two years later at a new place. because the other place. [ __ ] went under then that's what you got to. do so props to. those dudes out there. you know who you are i don't. know if you listen to. my pi i didn't have this. podcast back then when i did the [ __ ] first coffee bean. but it was wild. to see these dudes over when you get like you're listening. now if you're in your 20s. or something just remember i said this. when you're 42 and you see the same. person it's wild dude. it's really wild people just keep living it. makes me think about maybe we're in the metaverse. almost dropped that [ __ ] coffee. right there and we've been in the metaverse. for way longer than we thought. but i saw a batman. dude i saw batman. i was gonna do it. on my review mode in my uh in my um what do you call. it on my other i'm a patreon. [ __ ] cause i do that. segment review mode on my patreon. uh but yeah man i saw batman. and guess what dude. and this is a fact. it's the best batman ever. it's the best batman that's ever. been dude including all of them. yay including all of them. including all of them. including all of them. so stop right there some people are pissed. right now well actually you know okay. that makes me laugh because the dark. knight is the thing that set it. up and you know what if it wasn't for the dark. knight a lot of these superhero. movies wouldn't exist. but i'm gonna stop you right. there you [ __ ] dork. cause this one's the best. one yay [laughter] why because of everything. because of everything except catwoman because of everything. let me tell you right. now if catwoman is in a batman. movie that's a mistake catwoman is the [ __ ] worst superhero. it's what you know why. what does she do i'm waiting. what does she do hey go ahead. explain explain to. me driving in your car. or in your cubicle or on. your jog take a hot. second stop jogging relax and say. out loud to. me because we're talking this. is a conversation what does catwoman. do i'm waiting go ahead. oh oh oh what'd she do backflips. what'd she do avoid [ __ ] what. what what did she do. what did she ever do. what did that movie with [ __ ] halle berry do i'd rather go see that [ __ ] stupid movie with francis mcdormand. where she's just chilling. outside that came out last. year it's so boring dude. catwoman is the most boring character. there has ever been except for every frances. mcdormand character okay also the e. this is the thing that is awesome. about this batman and you agree dude. okay here we go. this is the thing that's awesome. about this batman is that christopher nolan who's great. okay who's great yes of course he makes confusing. movies like tenon and yes of course he makes crazy. movies like interstellar very. confusing was it good it. was just a lot if anybody says anything. about interstellar besides wow. that movie was a lot. then they're bullshitting you know. what i mean they're just bullshitting. okay but here's why batman. chris nolan okay so he kind of so he came out. with the first batman movie which was everyone was like whoa. and it was after chris christian. bale made the machinist. and he was like 14. pounds now all of a sudden he's beefed up. being batman and christian bale was a great. batman i can't argue that he's the first. guy who kind of changed his voice. and you kind of were like okay. i could see how people don't know. this is bruce wayne. because he kind of seems like a [ __ ] different super different person in this. thing he's talking differently. right he's not being michael keaton or adam. west where he's just like hey how's it. going you're like oh you're just the guy. you're bruce wayne right. but now the [ __ ] first one comes in and the the first movie uh that he made which was batman. begins right which was cool. okay batman begins fine there was too. much nonbatman [ __ ] in it i thought like if you're gonna make a movie about batman make a movie where he's kicking ass immediately i don't need to. see like him in his study. what should i do and then a bat flies. through the window and he's like huh. that would be a good like i don't need. to see all the origin. i don't need to. see his parents die like when he was six start. the ass kicking from jump. first scene should be just and he's getting. [ __ ] and just knocking [ __ ] out do you know what i'm talking about dude from jump dude don't even start with the credits. i don't give a [ __ ] who made it just from jump just [ __ ] yeah [applause] just flying from building. to build that kicking a guy with a mask. that's what we need immediately. stopping crooks all right so batman. begins no thank you now dark. knight was it a cultural. phenomenon yes you could argue that did it. pave the way for this realism in superhero. hero movies that for some people for some reason. people gravitate towards even those superheroes are. [ __ ] ridiculous yes it did okay but did it now would this new batman exist. if the other if the other chris miller. movies if they didn't if they weren't made i don't know but i don't give a [ __ ] right like people say richard pryor was the goat okay and now they say dave chappelle's the goat. and people say well would richard. pryor did richard bryan. pay the way for dave. chappelle yeah but i don't give a [ __ ] dave chappelle if he's the goat. he's the goat i don't give a [ __ ] i'm not that kind of guy. where it's like you got to. pay homage to. the other [ __ ] dude everything. sucks after 20 years. anyway you ever seen [ __ ] laurel. and hardy how hilarious is. it them trying to. get that piano up those. stairs okay no disrespect right. but my point is i saw this. new batman and they rooted it. in reality okay i mean the riddler. isn't even like laughing. or doing riddler [ __ ] he's just completely in like and i know what you did last summer. green kind of raincoat so it's way. different but there was it. was in this world where you bought. the cinematography was beautiful now robert pattinson. who i'm a huge fan. of he's a little thin right. and i'm like this is going. to be vampire batman. but it wasn't though. he played an emo batman. and they didn't really show. him too much as bruce wayne. which was good because i don't know. if i necessarily buy him. as this charismatic bruce wayne. but what the movie did was tonally they accepted. it and we accepted it. totally they made him batman. and he barely saw the light. in the day right. there's that one scene where he [ __ ] where he wakes where he's having a meeting and he's just like this. robert patton and rob pattinson doing that. smart acting just kind of like ah but the sunlight. you know he does this. crazy cool subtle acting where he's just like ah. that's that's the kind of acting i do. where i'm just like oh the sunlight. you know because we both do. smart acting but so it. was gr he was great. batman was great the guy. nailed that the cinematography was beautiful. which i don't even really. give a [ __ ] about make the story good but all of the rules. that they set up adhered. to all of the rules. that they set up the only thing. that happened that was kind of jerky. was when he hit the nitro. boost and the car [ __ ] ramped up. over the thing and then the penguin. thought he had him and then the [ __ ] whole thing exploded. and then batman came out. victorious which you know whatever. you got to have one of those. things but even when he pulled. that [ __ ] zip line when he jumped off the building. pulled that zip line and was the bat. guy you know and and [ __ ] was flying and even though he would have died doing that i kind of bought it because it was like all clunky. and [ __ ] and here's why it's the best. batman because my friends are like it's not better. than dark knight so then i went back. and i watched dark knight because that's what i do. why because i have ocd. why because i'm an addict why. because once i have something in my head. i can't let it go i watch one. batman i don't watch one. batman oh dude picture me. watching one batman i watch all. of them so i went directly home. i started watching the dark. knight and i'm not even going. to tell you the new batman. isn't it's not that the new batman. is better than the dark. knight i'm here to. tell you that the dark. knight is just good and watchable. and if you say it's great. you'll have a [ __ ] very fierce argument. on your hands if you're with me. okay because in the first scene. in the second scene the first scene. is the joker thing which is like. okay it's rooted in realism right. these are bank robbers trying. to rob a bank this. isn't guys jumping off buildings. and [ __ ] shooting flames or webs. out of their [ __ ] actually that's even doable i guess but nobody's flying right and then batman come comes in after these mock batman guys try to. ra save the day with guns. and batman comes in grabs someone's gun. on the end of the gun. and [ __ ] bends the gun dude is this rooted in realism or not dude you can't have something adhering. to the roots of realism. and then a [ __ ] crook comes by. with a rifle and batman. goes gunk first of all it's irresponsible right. get the guy if this is real. he might shoot your [ __ ] face off so don't just grab the [ __ ] and bend it get the guy right you didn't do that. so then you go to. bend the nozzle so you go. to bend the [ __ ] nozzle so what would happen. right the guy would let go of the gun. number one number two the guy. is 180 pounds he he would be. fighting back also you can't. bend steel so right. at that moment i'm out i'm out. you can't bend steel in the real world. with your hand so i'm out and then i saw batman. guess where a car would be jump down. flights of [ __ ] stairs uh or levels of of of uh what's the [ __ ] uh park lot and just crash onto. the [ __ ] car and get the scarecrow and i'm out dude. and then there's a scene where uh what's his name. uh from aaron eckhart is harvey dent. and he like a guy pulls. a gun on him. in the [ __ ] witness booth and then he he saves the day he grabs the gun and i'm like what rooted in realism dude. [ __ ] all that man the movie's just good this new batman reigns. supreme it's the best batman. and [ __ ] yes christian bell was a great. batman but dude this dude. nailed it robert pattons and nailed it. catwoman see you later never put catwoman in any movie ever. she sucks dude it just the character. sucks and the actress did. it fine but everyone else nailed. it do it colin farrell. where was he oh he was in the movie. where oh he was the penguin. stop lying that didn't look like him. or sound like him that's some [ __ ] good acting and i won't say masterful acting like my friend dan. did because that's [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] everyone always says stuff with the arts. is masterful but it's like you're really just [ __ ] you know you talk about other things that's masterful like like brain. surgery not not art because that's just. this review is devolving but it's the best. batman dude i spent entirely. too much time talking about. this batman but it's so good [music]. merch is off to. a good start this. year thanks to. ship station with ship station. you'll never worry about shipping. again make this switch to. a solution that handles all. your shipping needs quickly. affordably and painlessly take it from me. shipstation is already trusted by. over 100 000 ecommerce sellers uh keep track. of orders from any sales. channel easily find the best. shipping carrier with deeply discounted rates. uh and automate just about any shipping. task with just a few clicks. uh my favorite thing about shipstation. honestly is the fact that all of the fans. that uh get the merch. they get it fast. and they get it. hasslefree um it's really awesome. i get a lot of really cool. notes about that and that's all thanks. to uh shipstation save time by funneling all your orders into. one simple interface no matter what you're selling. it's very simple save money. uh when you compare carrier. options and choose. the best shipping solution every time. shipstation works with every carrier. so you can always find the best. fit for you your small. business can access the same. discounted rates usually. reserved for fortune 500 companies so that's cool. isn't it yeah okay so get with shipstation. uh you also could shave save your sanity. um knowing that it's just being handled. and taken care of and that you're getting. the best uh rates um they do. it all so it's kind of no. wonder why not 98 of companies that. use shipstation for a year. keep using it for as long. as they're in business. okay it's that good ship. more in less time with shipstation. use my offer code congrats. to get a 60 day. free trial that's two months free of no. hassle you like free right. it's stress free shipping all right. so go to shipstation. dot com click on the microphone. at the top of the page. and type in congrats ship station make ship happen.

[ __ ] guy so then i'm there for about three minutes talking to. someone else and then theo says yeah man. i don't know and leaves. to the guy and then the guy. comes over to me with all. of his weirdness and he's being actually weirder and you know. what he's doing just shuffling. around it's not like he's like being overtly weird. he's being covertly weird like he's dealing with. something internally and also wants to. talk about it but guess what he wants. to talk about it to. me and guess what i'm not that. guy because you already polluted. one area and i moved over to. another area and gentrified it. right so let's back. up and not pollute my new. neighborhood okay so he comes. over and he says now theo's. already gone and he says that was weird. okay well that was weird. so now i'm stuck because i know. theo and i know theo is. weird but i also know very little bit. about this new guy. but he's also weird and also i don't know him. so don't be weird have that thing. when you meet somebody and you want to. make a good impression don't you. you all i'm thinking of when i meet people is well i hope that they don't.

are we done. with kovid man like it's like i haven't heard anyone. get it since the [ __ ] queen of england. and i still gotta ask. for napkins at cafes like have them out. nobody's getting covered because you touch. something that's something else with nobody even has coveted anymore. and then somebody is like i got to. go to coffee shops and i'm like can. i get can i get it. they don't have the thing. anymore to get the napkins. from you got to. ask from behind the thing. because they think it's safe dude. you're fine we're fine. we're fine take your [ __ ] mask off. we're fine it's so annoying. that i gotta be there. and i gotta ask for extra. dude put it out you want to. wear a mask on. your own time wear a mask. on your own time. but don't you know put the napkins. out and then whenever you ask for napkin. to give you one. napkin like i need more. dude you see you know um [music]. i uh i gotta see morbius. is the main thing i'm trying. to say like i gotta see morbius. a hundred percent have to. see morbius because the guy who's in it. is j no we don't say. his name here because he tried. to have a [ __ ] cult and thwart my call but he can't thwart my call. but we don't say his. name but he's nameless here but [ __ ] jared leto. you know i'm talking about but we don't [ __ ] say. his name and he's good i mean. the guy's a good actor and he's 15. he looks like he's 25. and yeah we don't [ __ ] say his name but yes of course i'm talking. about jared leto but like dude. he's a weird [ __ ] guy and that's why he's a good actor because you have to. be super weird to. be a good actor you know. otherwise you're just like the rock. and you're just saying the lines. but he played morbius. and i found out the name. in the [ __ ] his name is michael morbius. dude which is like dude. that's so [laughter] [ __ ] stupid hi. michael morbius imagine you met a dude. named michael morby that should be the [ __ ] like dude. i'm barely on board. with peter parker by the way. the alliterations gotta go and i know they made this [ __ ] when the [ __ ] stuff was so corny anyway like back in the 40s. or whatever like batman. was like it pretty much. superman was gay as [ __ ] and it was but but he was supposed. to not be gay. like it's fine to. be gay but superman was supposed. to not be gay. but also he was so gay. you know even in the 80s. they did it with heman. but like yo you gotta rename the guy. michael morbius you gotta rename him. it's 2022. at least name him. jeff morbius also make it so his last name. isn't morbius that's so [ __ ] dumb because guess what if superheroes existed. and then i met a guy named. michael morbius it's him he. blew your secret identity change. e name dude michael morbius. like i get it clark kent. okay peter parker alliteration. but all right michael morbius. dude that's [ __ ] horrible change it and change it now it's 2022. and yeah the movie sucks it's got 17 on rotten tomatoes no [ __ ] it sucks the reason why michael morbius. dude hi i'm dr. morbius oh it's you oh you're the vampire. that that is the antihero. it's like we don't live in the [ __ ] year. 1800 anymore where nobody would know. jekyll and hot dude it says in the name. dude it's like if the [ __ ] super it might as the superheroes they might as well be superhero mix saves the day or doctor cleans the world up [laughter] his name is michael morvius and i put it on ticktock and all i said was michael morbius. and i was laughing. because when i was when i figured it out. his name was michael morby and dude. people under the comments. were like sorry dude. swinging a miss hey dude. i don't get it where's the joke. okay then you don't get it. and i feel bad for you. because i tell you right. now there is nothing funnier. than the fact that in 2022. they made that marvel's doing so well that. they had to go. to all the [ __ ] characters and make a movie of morbius. and they didn't change the name. michael movies because they have to. stay true to it so the [ __ ] dorks will be like well actually his name you should they got to. stay true because the movie will get dragged. in the movies better anyway. and the guy's name is still michael morbius. in it and nobody in the movie. is like oh it's you you're the guy. that's the vampire jared leto. how about the fact. that he's in the worst. marvel movie and the worst dc movie. and the guy just kills it. at acting also when he's not in one. of those movies right. like he'll just be in dallas. buyer's club and you're like okay. hand them the oscars and then when he tries. to do [ __ ] morbius you know hey marvel stop stop i get it but moon knight. and then people dude there's like [ __ ] 17 people that are like [ __ ] yeah dude finally my favorite one moon knight. this is gonna tank. two for disney plus. with the [ __ ] guy from whatever dune is in it. dude moon knight change their [ __ ] name dr michael morbius. dude you know imagine you went. to go see a doctor and his name was dr. michael morbius you'd be like is. anyone else in your practice. what nothing you're talking about no well. so one fire said i thought you're talking to. me for a second i mean. so [ __ ] this is good i make it like we're family like we're talking like we're having a conversation. i guess i do you know. i am talking to. you i'm talking to. everyone right and we're all family. i guess we have to. talk about this i didn't want. it because it's been so long. i recorded my [ __ ] podcast two hours before the oscars. and then that was that week's podcast. and then and then will smith decided. to [ __ ] [ __ ] slap chris rock and i was like ah [ __ ] well i guess i'm late on this and my views will suffer but still i've gotta [ __ ] talk about this because i'm a comedian number one and number two it was probably the biggest thing that happened and there's a war in ukraine there's the biggest thing that happened this week and people are getting slaughtered in [ __ ] ukraine so so all right if you live under a [ __ ] rock the oscars happen and chris rock said a joke about a gi jane joke about jada pinkett and will smith smacked him for it [ __ ] slapped him for it in the oscars i know you know this right i'm just saying it because i have to say it so how about first of all how about let's start with this why are how come the oscars have become a roastathon this is the oscars this is this is the oscars this is the most prestigious night now of course sucks donkey balls now of course it's a bunch of actors who played stupid parts that are just going like this all night now of course the oscars for [ __ ] of course the oscars are [ __ ] absolutely ridiculous and full of a bunch of actors going like this but it's the most prestigious night any what do we know if we listen to this podcast anything prestigious [ __ ] sucks right because prestige is nothing it's fake it's uh pretentious it's a fallacy it's just a bunch of people going like this so everyone dresses in their [ __ ] either nice tuxes or most stupid [ __ ] outfits of all time right goes to the oscars and they they it's the most prestigious night so if it's the most prestigious night then have it be the most prestigious nice night and by that i mean why is it a [ __ ] roastathon it's become a roastathon because you know i think that they think oh we get comedians to save the day because the oscars absolutely [ __ ] suck donkey balls we need we need for some we need somebody like ricky gervais at least we'll be funny but why is it a roastathon so ricky rodriguez goes on and shits on the oscars and everybody and okay and i love ricky gervais all right and i love a lot of these comedians but it's become a [ __ ] roastathon where everyone is just on making fun of people who do just have it be the. [ __ ] night it is hey guys you know what it's it's a it's boring. it's like a wedding ceremony it's supposed. to be boring. you're supposed to. have people not watch it. because it [ __ ] sucks the reason why the views are going down. for the oscars is because everyone's figuring out what. the [ __ ] it is boring. a bunch of actors going like this. and absolutely [ __ ] it's not supposed. to be tel watched. all right it used to. be cool before the internet. when william hurt didn't have a [ __ ] tick tock. you know what i mean. it used to. be cool when jared leto. wasn't out here on [ __ ] twitter and now we know everybody it's not cool anymore. to see al pacino. come up and accept. an award because [ __ ] the goddamn you know he's a [ __ ] did the daily news did an arc you can get everyone has access to. everyone at any given moment. nobody gives a [ __ ] anymore. about seeing some actor accept. an award and that's just the stone cold. facts dude so now it's become this. roastathon and of course you get these you know comedians up. there that are doing it really. good you got like ricky gervais and chris. rock which is hilarious and then you got people who are just so [ __ ] corny with it like amy schumer and and it's and it's just you're gonna get [ __ ] it's it's just becoming bad and unfun to. watch and that's fine. now chris rock went up. and he made a joke. about um uh jada pinkett smith about uh doing the uh the uh gi. jane 2 which first of all. is a joke about. her being bald i didn't know she had alopecia. and i heard someone say well it's because she suffers from alopecia. okay let's cool it. on the suffering on the word. suffer okay let's cool it. on she everyone's treating her. like she's got [ __ ] stage five cancer. dude her hair is kind of like gingerly. falling out and by the way i can still see it okay. so she's not suffering that bad. also she's hot as [ __ ] also gi. jane was hot. as [ __ ] dude you'd be lucky if you had a night with gi. jane right gi. jane was [ __ ] so sexy and she shaved her head. because she was in the army. so that's not even a dish. chris rock said gi jane. 2 i'm waiting for you. jada pinkett smith it was. fine did chris rock cross the line. you know what if he knew. she had alopecia yeah maybe he did. cross the line and guess what that's good. because that's what a [ __ ] comedian's job. is to cross the [ __ ] line how do you know where it is if you don't cross it. every now and then so whoopsie daisy. so good job chris rock on crossing. the line you did what a comedian. should do now will smith. sitting in the front row. laughs at the joke. looks over to jada smith she rolls her. eyes then will smith goes. oh she's upset i gotta do something about it. eh sir [ __ ] right because you were fine with it she rolled her eyes and now he gets up and he's a i gotta be a man about this walks up to. chris rock chris rock is like oh with his hands. behind his back chris rock. is [ __ ] 140 pounds. wet and will smith played. muhammad ali so. you know he's got some [ __ ] a little bit of technique and also because actors are so annoying. about how they play the [ __ ] you got you know like you got to. be the [ __ ] guy in the movie otherwise it's not. right like actors jobs are so easy. that they're like well i'll just be muhammad. ali for [ __ ] nine weeks and i'll learn how to. box and like you know i mean maybe you're muhammad. ali but i had an actor in that. [ __ ] i had a buddy that was acting in that show the pacific. that was like they made him. go to army boot camp. for [ __ ] out in the wilderness for like two months. and it's like you just got one. line in the movie and you don't need to. [ __ ] rough it in vietnam. for [ __ ] two months right. so so now will smith comes. up and is this is the biggest [ __ ] part is he's smiling. the whole time and he's being like hey i'm gonna [ __ ] do something and then chris rock hands. behind his back will smith. walks up to him and smacks. him in the [ __ ] face and then walks back to. his seat saunter back to. his seat now only wrong that's only wrong. anyone out here that's saying. like well the man defended his wife [ __ ] that you're a [ __ ] [ __ ] dude first of all whatever happened to. women can stand for themselves. women empowerment [ __ ] all that jada shoulda went. up and smacked him if she wanted. but the fact that will smith did. that and you think that that's what a woman. needs you're a [ __ ] piece of [ __ ] okay will smith did that it was only wrong he also did it in the most prestigious night of his career which was only wrong and here's the other thing where was security he thought he could get away with it or he didn't know or he was just blind. with anger he still went up. and did it where's [ __ ] security. all right where's security. run and tackle them. here's the other thing. dude chris rock had how many i'll tell you what i know. chris rock barely i know chris rock barely i've had one or two conversations. with him if i saw someone doing that. to him i would have [ __ ] ran up and helped out. period i don't give a [ __ ] if it was the oscars or not i would have ran up and [ __ ] i would have done some [ __ ] i swear to. god and i know a lot of people are probably. out there rolling their eyes. there's no [ __ ] way if i've only had good experiences with somebody. who is by the way. a comedian that i wouldn't have done. something about it maybe if it was joe. rogan or brendan shaw i would have [ __ ] let it fly. because they could handle themselves. but chris rock dude.

[ __ ] that and [ __ ] those dude it was it made me so i couldn't stop thinking about this [ __ ] for four days i thought about this [ __ ] i met will smith too he seems like a nice guy and you know here's the other thing dude he's just going through some [ __ ] obviously and i don't know what he's going through but only he does and only jada does right so everyone and now of course will smith made it worse for himself about the [ __ ] jokes about his wife and the jokes about him and how he's a cuck which he's [ __ ] not you know or he is and who gives you [ __ ] but like the internet is just going nuts over it and i feel bad for will smith too now because dude everyone doesn't know the situation and yes what happened was awful and will smith i'm sure he feels bad about it because he's not a sociopath but this was the moment where he broke this is the moment where he broke you can't keep up like dude i don't know how because i don't cause will smith is in the sociopath but like i think like guys like the rock are just like associate like i don't know how you maintain that i don't know how you keep that up and now he's got a zoa energy drinking [ __ ] and he's just like okay i drink tequila too here let's like i don't know how you keep that energy hey isn't it enough isn't a hundred million dollars enough i don't know what the [ __ ] energy is that you keep that you need to. keep doing this but like i break dude. i'm i'm i'm one one millionth of a fame. level that will smith is and this [ __ ] gets to. me dude people say [ __ ] about me i go i go i go into. hiding you know but will smith every [ __ ] day of his life he can't. go out of his apartment. he apartment he can't go. out of one of his 90. houses he can't do his [ __ ] and then he this is the moment. he broke it he did. it on the world stage literally and did it. the most prestigious night and it was [ __ ] and it was shitty. and it was and it then it's [ __ ] up and there's no nothing good about it. except for no there's nothing good. about it except for maybe he could learn. from the situation chris rock. handled it like a [ __ ] pro and i thought that that was amazing. and those are my thoughts on it man. you know and i don't know if it was funny. or not but i don't give a [ __ ] that's how i feel about it. and i just cannot [ __ ] believe amy. schumer didn't say [ __ ] about that. like you're done with me. as a as a like if you're my friend. and that happens i'm done. dude done huh he's gotta [ __ ] live that the only person. who made sense about to. talk about is jim. carrey when he said this. [ __ ] on the thing it's like a chris rock couldn't handle it. better yeah i don't want to. press charges i don't want to. sue you know it is what. it is and now that's all that anyone. is talking about and it took the whole night. away from everyone it even. took the whole night away. from will smith he won. the [ __ ] oscar it took his whole. night away from it it's all. anyone doesn't want to. talk about it so anyone. is ever going to. talk about in the during that. oscars and there were probably good shitty. movies that won morbius. should have [ __ ] cleaned up that night. is what i do know. and the award for best. worst name michael oh i'm. sorry morbius michael morbius. and morbius it's him it was him. the whole time everyone should have known. when they met him even. when he was his alter ego my because his name. is michael morbius jared little gets. up there with a [ __ ] bright. green trash bag on and a [ __ ] mailman hat hey nothing. to see here i thank you. for the award just look into. my steel blue eyes yeah yeah um the the fact that logan paul uh bought this. six million dollar rare. pikachu card and where by. by the way the the this. the words rare pikachu card you know. who cares how rare. it is but it's a thing. and it's a collector's item and by the way he looked badass. on the [ __ ] ww whatever it is and now i don't know. but uh he paid six million dollars. on a very rare. pokemon card and then wore that card. during his wrestlemania 38 years. of why because the internet. inspectors have destroyed reality yeah. it's true this is on kodakku dot com. but 27 year old paul. first teased his pokemon card accessory on april. 2nd when he revealed he's planning. to wear the very rare. so he wore it in wrestlemania. 38 a six million dollars. dude get it how do you not how do you not be robbed. right there's people out there. getting robbed in beverly hills. nobody [ __ ] robbed this [ __ ] off his neck this is insane. most of the special pokemon. card in the world right. now and partially is because he and he paid. for it like if he tried. to resell it right. now there's no way. he could get [ __ ] six million dollars. for it and he did it. to be in the headlines. but my question is uh how much money. two things it's twofold how much money. does logan paul have and then also how much money. do you have to. have to spend six million dollars. on a [ __ ] pikachu card cause like if you have a hundred million dollars. spending six of it on a pikachu. card is a [ __ ] horrible idea so if you have 200 million dollars. and you spend six million dollars. on a pikachu card that's a horrible. idea if you have three now. if you have three million dollars. and you want to. spend six million dollars on a pikachu card. that is a horrible. idea so at what point. does it become not a horrible. idea now let's not pretend that. logan paul makes the best decisions. but he's a great guy. and he makes good decisions. businesswise i know him i love the dude. right and you know he makes great. decisions businesswise right that prime energy. drink but he made this decision. which seems like a bad decision. but also probably doesn't matter but my point. is how much money does he have and then how much money do you have to. have half a billion he does. he doesn't have half a billion. but if you had half a billion then okay. maybe six million on a picture. card if you really love pokemons. right would you say half. of this is insane to. me he just want to. be in the gizz book. of records how much is that. worth how much is the pr. of buying this card worth is what. i want to. know not six million certainly and then how much can you sell it. for so he's gonna take a hit when he tries. to sell it or maybe he won't try. to sell it but he could always sell it. right he could always sell it. if he wanted to well i forgot to. talk about this tweet about what happened. when the [ __ ] will smith thing happened this was the best one. i thought this was a joke. when i first saw it is by sophie. hagan who's uh has no brain. i guess but like um so she she is. yeah it's a woman so she writes i think will. smith should this is so great man. everyone making everything about everything. that it's not is just so great. right everyone makes everything about everything. that it's not that's what the internet. does but this woman writes. i don't know who she is. she got a blue check she's probably. a sweet lady i'm just making fun. of you okay um she says i think that will smith. [ __ ] and then hyphen wait looks at hands. with aster surrounded oh hang on i'm quite. white so maybe i don't need to. have an opinion on what a. black man did to. another black man because of what he said about his black wife. maybe i should just shut up. and listen hey no no. first of all what you did. isn't going to stop anyone. from talking it's just going. to exacerbate and uh you exasperated. the situation you made white. people look dumber than even. talking about congratulations dude. you can talk about anything. you want it's how the internet. works also this has nothing to. do with race a guy. hit a guy and it was bad. was he black k was the other guy. black k was the wife. black k a guy hit another guy and it was bad. dude people making everything. about everything that it's not is. hilarious i don't i think that will like to. think that you're a hero. in this situation for black people because you tweet something. like hey if you're white you shouldn't chime in on how do black people give a [ __ ] about not chiming in also hey you're chiming in don't talk about it. don't not [ __ ] god you know it's like you don't know the situation period. so you might as well either chime in or not. it has nothing to. do with the fact that you have white. hands so dumb dude. hey will smith should hold. on a second i've actually never worn a suit. myself and they're both dressed in suits chex dress checks body hmm. wearing a frilly dress maybe. i should shut up and listen. a man was protecting. his family let me check around. hmm czech surroundings no kids. but i'm at home not a mom. i don't have kids those. men have kids who am i to. tell a man who has a family how to. react on a joke. about his family hmm. maybe i should just shut up. and listen i mean. how far does it extend. dude race wasn't an issue. here also it was hilarious. that the first um [music]. the first [music] time that. it was presented by like a black person. organization the oscars that this. happened black lives matter. real questions this came out i hate that. joke hey they've been real quiet. since that's it for youtube. uh if you want to. catch the rest of the show the uncut ad. free episode uh and all that free. episodes uh go to. patreon dot comcrystalia and you can get the extra. episode there's like 13. episodes or something 12 or 13. episodes now that aren't available except for here on except for on patreon. and uh also every month there's a one patreon episode. that we don't do for youtube. so uh and there's another there's other stuff. too like behind the scenes. stuff for the with chris. videos and also uh the uh segment. um that we do called. review mode so yeah uh have at it. patreon dot com thanks [music]. you
