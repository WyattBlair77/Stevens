[ __ ] walking around no door there. there's no doorways i mean. everything's a big doorway there in mars. because there's no rooms. but anyway um then there are theaters. that are the so there are the stateoftheart. theaters and then the nice theaters. that were built in 1910. and then there are theaters. that are like built in 191 or 20. that are like haven't been upt and are shitty. and they pretend like they're historic venues and it's like no. just burn it down make a new one. and i'm not going to. say if the crest theater is one of those or not but what i am. saying is historic venues like uh the ryman are beautiful. um so anyway but every time you go to. one of these theaters. there's that guy that's just like yeah. this is it this is when uh this is when they brought in the uh they had uh the original performance. of greece here for three. months and the the town had a they thought it was too. risque so they had a protest. and this is where one. of the protesters died. and you're like can i just get on. stage and tell my dick. jokes dude can can i just start. talking about cargo pants. into a microphone but anyway. i i seem ungrateful i'm not. i'm i'm grateful for all the gigs. i'm grateful for everybody. that wants to. talk to me uh and uh and you're allowed. to have bad days and that's it. dude i i i actually when i do the meet and greets. i sell 100 tickets. for meet and greets and those go. quick by the way people. are always hitting me. up i see them on the instagram. comments and stuff like do you how come you don't. do meet and greets. i do do meet and greets. but they all sell out. in like a minute. when i go on sale. because those are the tickets. that get sold quickest because the people who want. to do a meet and greet. are the people who buy the tickets. quick because they know what my schedule. is because they're fans of mine. so um i do meet and greets. i'll tell you what man. i meet a lot of really nice sweet. people in meet and greets. some people with bad breath. you know some people just stink. straight up and some people smell. very nice some people. are so sweet and caring some people would be my friends. some people i think well that's interesting. that person likes me. i wouldn't think that person likes. me or my comedy but i'll do a meet and greet. and um and it's nice and and sometimes. i see the pictures online. that the people post from the meet and greets. and i'm like oh [ __ ] man i got to. work on my face cu. i'm not in a bad mood. sometimes i'm not in a bad mood. and then i see a picture of me. and i like and i'm like oh i got to. work on my face because this is how i am totally happy but this is how i am look. look this is me getting. a this is me getting. a check thrilled don't look. it i don't really ever know. what my face is doing maybe that means. i'm a bad actor i'm a good. actor though so i don't get it. um so anyway i'm in the middle. of watching this documentary the the the fall. of minnesota and it's just like they're it's trying. to like it's just trying to. push me further i'm in the middle of the fall. of minneapolis or whatever. it's called fall of minnesota. fall of minneapolis i never know. which one's the city. and which one's the state because don't have the main. city in your state start with the first. half of what the state. name starts with right. right and the worst culprit is new york. new york and then new york. new york at least in a way it's the best. because you can't really be wrong. you know i'm from new york. oh new york new york. new york oh new york. i meant to state but yeah new york. new york i'm from that actual city. so yeah works both ways. you wouldn't you know minneapolis. minnesota is crazy it's like if there was a it's like
