i came to 3am. last night went to. bed kristen didn't even hear. me coming to. bed and then woke up in the morning. and then had a whole day. and then in the in the evening. i was like i think i'm going. to play red dead redemption. 2 again and she goes. like this oh really and i said yup. and she said wow. i said i know. i'm all backwards man because i streamed so much. last night and she was like oh um when did you go. to bed and i said three o'clock. and that was not a lie. but it was a little bit after. three o'clock it was like 3 15. but i kind of like you know what i mean. i shaved 15 minutes off. of it and she goes and she says wow. and i said i know. but honey i'm a gamer now. and i'm sorry dude i'm sorry. but i'm a gamer so follow. us over on flex. avenue we're having a good time. dude i shot a [ __ ] ram you know. what i do dude. let me tell you something. about these video games. dude first of all not you know. much like other things i thought i thought that. maybe some this is what i'm realizing. about myself when i'm trying new things. and honestly trying video games. is a new thing for me. so what i'm telling you is. it's not going to. be the whole thing that i don't. like like i don't like sports right. but i'm sure that there's a sport. out there that i would like to. play i'm very active. you know i'm sorry. to break heart strong. guys but i'm very strong. and very active weightlifting that's kind of a thing. i like i like throwing around. a kettlebell you know. what i'm talking about and um [music]. so that's what i like doing. and so there are video games. which i don't like as a whole. there are video games. i do like a network. dead redemption 2 and i love. that game and i can do. whatever i want and uh i'm spreading activism in the game. that's what i'm doing i'm an activist. in a red dead redemption 2. and i did. a stream i didn't realize how much of an activist i was until. i did a stream on red. dead redemption and this guy this. old timer this guy with like one of those ring around. hairs with no hair on the top. but it was long like that. i don't know why some people actually. have that cut still now dude. there will be bald. guys that are completely cue. bald and then a ring around hair. with and it's long but what but what are you doing. though right but what are you doing. growing it long when you don't even have it. on top but what are you. doing though right are you a friar no because there are no friars. anymore so this guy with one. of those long it's like you know what it's like it's like your ears. are wearing a cape that's what it. looks like right and so this. guy was wearing his you know his his he was his ears. were wearing a cape and he had on this. [ __ ] vest and a nice tie. you know how everyone used to. dress up before 1960 no. matter what no matter what time. period it was everyone dressed up everyone [ __ ] dressed up it doesn't matter what 1920s everyone was wearing like a suit and [ __ ] 1940s hey what's going on kid you know like that kind of [ __ ] and then way back into. the [ __ ] king's time they were all decked out. and [ __ ] or you were a knight. right or you just couldn't. afford clothes but if you had clothes you. were dressing to the [ __ ] nines before 1960. 1960 people were like what. are we [ __ ] doing dude. let's roll around in the mud. let's wear hippy [ __ ] let's [ __ ] kiss each other we don't need to. be dressed for that you know. i mean back then you know. in the 40s and 50s people had tshirts. but they were nerd dwells. so anyway i [ __ ] i asked this guy it became socially acceptable to. wear a tshirt ever since. 1960 is what i'm saying. but anyway so i'm in red dead. redemption 2 and this. guy asked me to. go get his pocket. watch he asked me. to go get his old. gun that's an antique and he asked. me to go get his ledger. now if you play red dead redemption 2. you'll understand what i'm saying. but if you don't play it. you don't understand what i'm saying. yet and that's good because you can come. along on the story with me come on. dude i was playing it. for the first time just like you're hearing. it for the first time. so this old guy asked me. to do the thing and i went and i found this guy's pocket. watch i found his old gun which by the way. there were already two thieves. in his house saying hey partner. this is this we already found this. house and i said and i had to. [ __ ] risk my life i got the gun from the guy of course i looted him i got about [ __ ] you know a dollar and a half. which is loaded back. then and then i found the ledger. i read the ledger. i read the ledger. a little bit and then i stopped it and i was like what's going. on right i was like what's going. on i don't want to. have to read this whole thing. and somebody in the chat. says basically he's just not a good. a good guy somebody on the flex. avenue chat says you know what he's not a good. guy just go ahead and return the ledger. so i return the ledger. and as i'm i get to. the guy with the [ __ ] skirt around his ears right with the cape like his ears have a cape on it remember that guy in the beginning of this story i give him the ledger. and my character's mad at him. he's like hey man. i don't know why you wanted. this [ __ ] ledger you shouldn't be doing this and that and i'm like what the [ __ ] is going on here my character's mad but i'm not in this game right because you know me when i go full force i go full force when i go do something it's all in and i realize i'm cheating myself and i'm cheating flex. avenue on twitch i'm cheating. it and it's only we're we're hurting the experience right. so i say to. the chat why is this. guy so mad and somebody says oh well you just found out. that he he owned. slaves now you know what we believe as a cult. on congratulations okay slavery is not good. all right i've said it. before in this podcast and i will say it. again and i will say it. until my heart stops beating okay slavery is not a good thing. to do all right. i've always said that. you know there's a lot of flipfloppers. politicians going to you know. joe biden used to. be like oh yeah i think only men and women. should get married we have no. place for gays and now he's all like hey gay it up i got flags printed. right flipflopping and flipflopping isn't necessarily a bad. thing because you want to. grow and evolve as a human. being but one thing that i'm telling you. i will never evolve from is. slavery is not a good thing. to do it doesn't matter. how many decades pass. how much time ticks your boy. dalia will always be against slavery. okay so now i'm sitting i'm thinking i got an audience. on flex avenue i'm like how do i deal. with this [ __ ] right and like yeah he owned slaves and i was like whoa first of all whoa for rockstar games for even broaching the subject whoa i mean i know this game gets bags there's a part two already and they're working on part three i mean whoa but they broached it and even if they did try to. say see if some woke [ __ ] came after rockstar games and was like hey you shouldn't be doing this even though it's part of history you shouldn't have this in the video game it teaches the wrong message to. kids whoa they won't stop because bags. they won't stop right because rockstar games. is a corporation what do. we know about corporations. they don't give a [ __ ] about anything except bags. but here i am not the corporation. i'm just a guy behind the [ __ ] remote control. trying to play the game. right and i'm like you know what what's the right. thing to do here. because you could do anything. in this game i mean. i gave a donation in this. game to a lady. that was trying to. help homeless and then you know what i did. she said thanks i took it back. not only did i take it. back i took everything in her box. i already took the donations. all right do i feel bad. about that no but my character. might but what i'm saying. is not doing slavery is a [ __ ] thing dear to. my heart so a hog tied him. i hogged item somebody in the chat. said he's not worth it. let him go and i said he's he does. slavery and we don't stand for that. so i hogtied him and then i picked him up and i brought him over to. the fire because i thought it would be funny. because i thought oh how funny would it. be if he caught fire. but video games you know. video games you know them. right they're not real life. so i just threw him. on the fire and for like 30. seconds he was just on the fire. and i was like see video games. aren't ready they're not. like real life people are like oh video games. are like real life if they're real. life then how come sometimes. when i park my horse. it's standing like that right. sometimes when i park. my horse it's standing. literally like that when horses would stand. like that it doesn't look. like real life in red dead. redemption it's very beautiful but please. stop saying video games are like real. life so i'm just sitting waiting looking at them. in the fire and i'm making fun. of them because video games. aren't real like real life. and i say to. the chat i'm like look at this. dude so [ __ ] ridiculous and all of a sudden the guy [ __ ] catches fire the guy starts burning. alive the old man. with the [ __ ] cape around his ears starts rolling around hog. tied and goes oh my god and burns alive and i felt crazy. so i [ __ ] took out my dual wielding. pistols and i shot him in the head. so he wouldn't suffer right. yeah i wanted his life. to end because he was all. into slavery but i didn't want. him to burn alive. so i shot him. in the head and then when i rolled by on my horse. for the rest of the stream i told i told them. me as crystalia every time. i rolled by a black person. in the game i told them. i told them what i did. i said i have a i have a crazy. story for you and i told them. exactly what i did. i hugged out the guy. and i burned him alive so you have a nice. day so don't come to. me and tell me that i don't do. activism all right they tried to. crash my stream two times. because they don't want me. doing [ __ ] activism [ __ ] in red dead redemption but it's all good follow us. on flex avenue anyway. dude we have a silly. goose time dude but we also are activists. that activism that i did was way. more than any activism show that. cbs ever did or will ever. do that show will never come. out i i guarantee it. like that guy in the [ __ ] burlington coat factories guy the [ __ ] ass guy and i guarantee it you know the guy that literally looks like [ __ ] that guy's literally

you know i'm in a program. i have a men's group. right i'm an addict but you know. that's real talk but it permeates it. to everything in my life. now what happened the other night. was i turned on netflix. all right now i'm a i'm a hulu. i'm going to be honest. with you guys okay. i'm on netflix a lot. but i'm a hulu guy. all right why am i a hulu. guy because i started watching things. like lego masters and some reality. stuff and [music] gordon ramsay. stuff and he's on about 30. of what hulu has uh for real. i mean gordon ramsay has so many cooking shows. but also he'll just pop. in and like a movie that. willarnette is in and he'll just be like how's it. going get out of the kitchen. and will our net. will run out of the kitchen. and be like sorry but um he's in it. you know like he'll just be in a [ __ ] what who's that. guy the george the [ __ ] uh who's the guy that plays the what's going to. be funny i was going. to be jeffrey who's the [ __ ] guy who got the actor best. actor jeffrey the old old guy. and the [ __ ] pirates of the what jeffrey. rush dude hell yeah. dude he was in the movie. quills jeffrey rush was in quills acting in quills. and all of a sudden gordon ramsay. was in one of the dungeons. and he was like out. of the kitchen anyway i was i'm a hulu. guy is what i'm saying. you know but i turned on netflix. and the first thing that popped up. was and here's how much my attic. permeates into my regular life. i'm in dude i'm in bed. and i start a movie that jake gyllenhaal. is is in it's a new movie. that came out on netflix. and it's called the guilty all right. now i don't know if you know much. about me and how i feel about jake gyllenhaal. but there's two things i feel about jake. gyllenhaal all right he is a fantastic. actor no cap that's it. wrap it up that's it. wrap it up right we're done. here he's a great. actor that's how good he is. you could say that and just end. on it right that's how good of an actor jake gyllenhaal. jake jill knows a great. actor guys okay let's pack up. let's pack up let's file. these papers let's get everything. all done i'll do the paperwork. right here's another thing about jake gyllenhaal. he's too weirdly buff. in every part he plays okay. right like he'll play a pizza delivery. guy and you're like why. is he so [ __ ] string bean. jacked right why is he built like a [ __ ] brick house. and he works at a call. center brickshit house why is he built like a [ __ ] brick [ __ ] house and he's a [ __ ] pilot you know what i mean jake gyllenhaal is just all like i'll be the pilot and you're just like hey you're a fantastic actor but do kind of a you don't have to. do totally what christian. bale does you know. christian bale will play [ __ ] uh vice the vice. president dick cheney but he'll just be like oh you guys know i'm i'm dick. cheney right and while i do this. movie there is no dick. cheney that's not me okay. so here i gain [ __ ] 100 pounds and go bald. right you don't have to. do what he does i think. that's ridiculous and that'll only land. you to a viral. oh good for you moment. right remember that moment we know here. at congratulations but um so now we're talking about jake. gyllenhaal and jake gyllenhaal is a fantastic. actor but he's also weirdly string being [ __ ] uh brickshit how strong no matter what the [ __ ] he plays right ever since he played that movie where he played that boxer where his wife died. and eminem did the soundtrack. he's just seriously string. being [ __ ] brick [ __ ] house buff even when he's playing he'll be in honestly he'll do like a voice in the new ice age. movie and and you'll still be like okay. but he's too string. being brick [ __ ] how strong as this. squirrel right so weirdly. buff fantastic actor all right so i turn on this. movie the guilty and i'm in bed. with kristen and she's like you just put something on i put it on now. all of a sudden we're watching the movie. and this happens so much with my lady. man she'll tell me to. turn on something i'll turn it. on i'll get invested she'll tell. me she doesn't like it anger. rising okay but we do therapy. so let's quell the anger. but at this point it's too. strong rising now why is it. too strong because jake gyllenhaal. is a fantastic actor he's drawing. me in he's doing cryings when he's not supposed. to be doing cryings and he's not crying. when you think he would be crying. right like that's how jake gyllenhaal will be like his he'll watch his wife. get [ __ ] shot up by a bunch of gangsters. and be like mary mary. mary right but then i'll ask you for a baked. potato in one scene and you'll be like why are his eyes. welling up the guy's unpredictable dude. except for his body. his body's predictable we've learned. that so so so now i'm watching this. movie the guilty and i'm all in and she's like i don't like i don't like stuff. where like i don't like stuff. for like maybe the kid. the kid dies in it. and it seems like the kid's. gonna be dying in it. and i'm just like okay but you told me. to turn it on. and i'm invested she says well. why don't you just go. into the why don't you go. why don't you go into. the you go into. a different room you go. into a different room. now what people on tick tock. don't know is i have more than one. tv now what why i say the people. on tick tock. is because i posted a video where i was watching tv. on tik tok and everyone says wow. why did you hang your tv. too high above the fireplace. you should hang it lower and they're saying. it like i don't have another tv. that might be lower and more. comfortable to watch now. let's not talk about that. because this is about the movie about jake gyllenhaal. but i do have more than one. tv okay so i go downstairs. to finish the [ __ ] movie i'm in therapy i quell my anger. i say okay sweetheart. good night leave her. to do her crossword puzzle and listen. to murder podcasts. and i go down now yes i am watching. the tv that is too. high on tech. talk but it's all good it. doesn't matter i was watching it. and it's fine to. me all right so i'm watching the [ __ ] jake gyllenhaal movie and it is 12. 30 okay half of the hour the movie's over. so i'm like i guess i'll watch the whole thing. it'll be over at two. [ __ ] it but the movie draws me in it draws me in really good. and i feel uncomfortable and i'm not going to. spoil the movie but it's very kind of sad what happens but by the end you're left with some sort of okay you know that uh that nice american just the character. did what he had to. do even though he was a weird. flawed person right that's pretty much. every american movie no matter what the movie. is it doesn't matter if the guy's an antihero. a hero or a [ __ ] you know whatever else there is the guy in the american. movie even though he's flawed he. kind of ends up doing usually. the right thing right that's usually what the american. movie is about the movie. ends and i'm like wow. jake gyllenhaal sure can [ __ ] act his way. out of a paperback you could probably put him down [ __ ] in you could put cement blocks you could kill him like lips manliness and dick. tracy and he would still [ __ ] rise to. the surface by using. acting like he could probably act his way. out of a [ __ ] out of cement blocks is what i'm trying to. say so i'm watching a movie. and it ends and at the end. of the movie it says let me. just pull it up to. make sure uh it's the right. thing here it says based on den skylage. right now it says based on den skylage. i'm looking at this. word my first thought is i can't. see what it says okay. my next thought is my heart. beats fast am i dying because what is this. word den skylage skyldidge. right and i think is it. based on a person is it. ben skyldidge and then i think no. cause i got closer. den skyle didge so i google. ben skeldige and while i'm googling. while i'm typing den skylage i'm. thinking i have this wrong. because it's not a word. and not once did i think it. was a foreign word. so i googled then skydige and my phone did the thing where it was like i was taking so i was like no no back back. back i got to. spell it and then no don't predict. it it's [ __ ] dense skylage i keep looking back. back back it's not ben skyridge it's den skaldich. back back back and i finally hit the [ __ ] x and then i google it. boom it's a movie from denmark. movies based on a book. fine movies tv series based on a graphic novel. fine movies based on a poem. fine movies based on a story somebody told you once. fine movie based on a banana fine. but when you base a movie on a movie that's already successful. you gotta tell me before. i watch the [ __ ] movie that's unfair. you play dirty that's a dirty. game netflix and i've got a bone to. pick with you yeah okay we've definitely had our differences. you know i've worked for you. you cut me out of some stuff. whatever we won't talk. about it but what i will. say is if i'm gonna be watching a movie. that has an that's about a movie. that already happened you [ __ ] tell me hey hold up there's a different movie that's actually this movie first but you didn't do that. so i googled it and i was all in like i said in the beginning. of this i'm all in dude. i'm all in when i watch a [ __ ] movie and when i googled it i thought hmm i wonder if i could see dense skullditch. i wonder if i could see den scaldage. right now so i looked up where to. watch then scaldage and guess where you can watch then scaldage hulu. now let's go back. to the beginning of the story i'm a hulu. boy okay that's what i am. i've told you that so when i saw that. den skaldich was the. first movie that was the guilty on netflix. only it's on hulu and it was made by the way not even decades ago. two years ago i went. right to hulu and i accessed it. because i have netflix and hulu. and i started watching then scaldage. and i have to. be honest with you even though. i am all in and my addict this. is attic behavior by the way. through and through even with little things that permeates like i said i started watching the movie. and i thought i'm just gonna watch and see how the guy does. it if he doesn't like jake gyllenhaal. or how many of the lines. are different or the same. or whatever so the movie started and jake gyllenhaal. sure can act his way out. of some cement blocks but this guy. this guy was the guy this. guy was doing everything that christian. bale does but without all of the weight. without all of the pulling. hair out of his head. he was just simply the guy. because i didn't know this. guy sure he was probably very very famous. in denmark but what the [ __ ] do i know. but he was just the guy. at the call center acting. with no string being brickshit house. body he was just some guy. doing the part and that drew me. in so i watched the whole [ __ ] goddamn movie again. i watched it again. i watched both versions of the movie. i watched the first movie. the first movie ended found out about den skylage. and then i watched the second movie. and i watched the whole thing. and the movie was exactly the same. the screenplay was. the same until the end the end is different. and i'm not going to. spoil it for you. guys but the end made the denmark. movie better okay it's better. it's better the movie from denmark. the danish film is better. is denmark danish i don't. know it's danish but anyway it's a film. then skylage and it's really [ __ ] good and it means the guilty and the guy in it is so good and i want to. spoil it i want. to tell you why it's a better. movie but it's just very not american. man the way he [ __ ] comes to. his you know characters fruition or whatever. the [ __ ] is just so very and i don't know i've never been there. but it's very danish and i loved it. dude the moral of the story is don't [ __ ] remake. a movie okay two years. later and not dude drives also or also it. says screenplay by dude. you just translated it it. should literally just say translated by. and then the credit should be somebody translated by done. math that's what it should say. that's what it should [ __ ] say dude. now i i get it. dude you know it's like you want the credit. and cool and everyone needs. their credit everyone wants their [ __ ] credit nowadays right. it's so [ __ ] like everybody's like well if you posted my meme you better. tag me and tell people i don't give a [ __ ] dude if i made memes out there take them as a matter of fact say my old jokes. i don't give a [ __ ] i won't even call you out. on it i don't care. i don't care i don't. care man there was a comedian. that did my joke. a [ __ ] uh a friend of mine the other i i told him i was like yo just so you know i did that joke. and you put it out. there and and he was like oh logan. said something and i was like look. i don't give a [ __ ] man. i'm just telling you in case. you want to. [ __ ] know i don't give a [ __ ] he probably thought about it on his own too i'm not saying he even stole it but like dude my point is just it's never the movie's never going to. be better than the original. movie right because if it's a if if they're going to. remake it that means it's a success. so in effect. if it's a success just you're not. going to make it. better that doesn't mean you're not you can't. get bags okay fine but it's you know netflix. wants the content but there's not. even a theater release so it's not. really even making bags. but um i watched the movie i've been watching a lot. of [ __ ] man i don't mean to. make this whole thing a [ __ ] review but it's like uh whatever dude i saw i i i saw squid. game by the way dude. squid game okay i'll tell you right. now i am not a [ __ ] hater i tell [ __ ] how it is you know me and i'm no cuda. dude i'm not trying to. like like [ __ ] because of the hype he says this while he's wearing yeezys yes. fine i understand i like the look of the shoe. but still dude i don't [ __ ] buy the hype. but i turned on squid. game because of the hype. because i'm like let's see what this. is all about maybe i could talk about it. on my podcast turned it. on hooked liked it. is it as good. as everyone's saying probably not but it is very good. it is good but everyone's acting like this. show is jesus and the show. in fact does not jesus. is just some show and it is very good. some of the acting's very good they draw. you in it doesn't redo. the wheel it's not like [ __ ] uh breaking bad that shows great it's not sopranos. it's not even the wire and sometimes. in the wire i'm like yeah. no i i guess it is good. right everyone love the wire. and i'm sitting there like yeah yeah yeah no yeah and i don't really. know so i'm watching the [ __ ] thing and it's drawing me. the [ __ ] and i like squid. game dude i like it a lot i like the games. they play they got to. play games they got to. play six games there's 450 people. that come into. a place uh by choice and they have to. play games to. stay alive and the as the six. games go by people die. until there's very few people left. and they got to. split the money all right. that's what it's about. i summed it up nicely. that's what it's about. and it's good and i watched. it in two two and a half. days okay i was very loserish doing this. but i did it and i was happy. about it and i tried. to watch it in the [ __ ] uh voice over shits. because you could do that. on the streaming shits. you could turn on audio. and you could be like i'll be like you know. at first they were like and i'm reading. it but i'm like kind of missing. it and [ __ ] and also i can't text my friends while i'm watching it because i got to. be reading the [ __ ] so i'm like maybe i'll turn the voices. [ __ ] on but when they do the voice acting dude why are they it's so bad it's worse. than video games in video games. they'll be like you might want to. talk to the stork the stork has that information but dude. in in in like subtitled [ __ ] if you turn the american. or the uh the english or the whatever. it's so bad they'll be like oh watch out. i'm coming through it'll it'll be like a guy. with a stack of papers. just like oh watch out. i'm coming through and then if you turn it. off and rewind it and you just read. the subtitles and you listen. to it in korean it's like oh they're actually acting well. so i turned it on for a little bit then i turned it. back off for a little bit and i started reading. it because these people are just like whoa. hold on i'm coming through. oh and forget it if there's a kid. if there's like a sixyearold in it. because the [ __ ] actor if even if it's like a boy a sixyearold boy. it will be like a 40. year old woman that's like hi. um excuse me you know. and you're just like oh jesus. dude so i'm watching the [ __ ] squid. game and it's great. and that's cool good gay. squid game i like it and you know what i'm a big. proponent on people americans. especially seeing [ __ ] that isn't. uh necessarily american right. it's a korean series great. that's why i'm plugging den. scaldage right now you gotta see. this movie it's great and it's danish. and it's not american but boy. when i say that watching that.
