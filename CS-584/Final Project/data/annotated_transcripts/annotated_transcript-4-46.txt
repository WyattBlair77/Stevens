 [music] hey guys it's episode. 187 of congratulations [music] oh you guys what's going on listen. before we even get started. um i uh it's uh i i i um i wanted to. say that go you know. you can support the show. with our patreon but also you can buy merch. we got merch out. there we got the the life. rips uh hoodies and the shorts. and the and um i'm also coming out. with some new [ __ ] uh and some socks. i believe but uh just living it. up showing you how life rips. because life can rip if you make it rip. and that's it and that's and i dude. i don't make the rules. i mean i make the rules. i made that rule pretty much. uh it's the only rule i've ever. made but um no that's not true. actually if you ask kristin. definitely i've made more rules. uh than uh than i should have. i made that rule about. how she gets on me. about how i eat out. of the side of my mouth. i put the [ __ ] when i eat food. i take the food. and i don't chomp it. when i was a kid. i never wanted to chomp it. directly because some shit's too hard and some shit's too uh difficult. to eat i didn't want to. chomp it directly on my front teeth. because number one it was too. difficult and number two the food. was too hard and number three. i didn't ever want to. get food stuck in my in my teeth. right in the front teeth. rather get food stuck in the back. teeth so people can't see that [ __ ] right so um she was like i was eating tuna earlier today the the pieces. not the [ __ ] not tuna fish. but not the tuna fish. salad what the [ __ ] they call it but the regular pieces. and i went to. go and i was just taking the slabs they were seared. you know and i'd taken the slabs. and i was just going. to i count and i was eating. that and she was like i don't like how you do that. and i was like first of all let me live number. one number two it's better. to do that and she was like why. and i said i said i made i decided when i was a kid i was gonna be doing that. because it's better that way. and i created that way. of eating and she said you didn't create. it and i said yes i did. and she said you know. it's so [ __ ] to. [ __ ] have to. try and think of a way. to eat when you can just eat and i was like no. freaking way dude it is not [ __ ] and i thought of it before. i even started eating from the front. like this so i thought about it. without even having to. correct it and i did it. the right way so now that we got past. that great and that's rule. two now what is going. on here why is everything. so distracting why is everyone. looking under the table. what's going on is it. the dog okay so the dog. the trash dog is eating. a fortune cookie that's fine. let him [ __ ] do it let's not all go like this. oh like there's a fire. under the table so i get [ __ ] up telling my [ __ ] great. eating at the side of my mouth. story okay um i do great stories and when people are looking at the other. way when i'm telling a great. story and they're going oh oh oh oh then i get all [ __ ] up like a fire's under the table okay. and i'm not mad but i'm just speaking. very passionately because this is my passion. baby whoa this. is my passion baby whoa. so yeah life rips if you let it rip. life rips if you make it rip. and it's a ripping mindset. dude so uh go to. chrisley dot com and you can go. see all that [ __ ] merch it's hot. [ __ ] dude i'm a fashionista let's start with mother's day man it was mother's day and it was beautiful. and i put up a nice post. um on instagram for uh. kristen cause you know it. was mother's day and i wanted to. be very loving and uh it was nice it. was really nice and i was crying. i was writing the caption and i was writing the as i was writing the caption i was crying. and she's like why are you crying. and i was like ah it's nothing. because what do you say. i'm on instagram and so uh so i put it up. and but i wanted to. say happy mother's day to. all the mothers out there. and i hope you celebrated with your mother. i love my mother. very much she's a very sweet. lady and i am very happy. for the way that she raised. me and i just wanted to. say that because sometimes we don't sometimes. we get emo on this. podcast and sometimes we keep it real. occasionally we do both and this is both we're being a little bit emo but we're also keeping it real i love my mommy okay and that's that um but i also wanted to. say something else because i put this on my instagram. story and i think it's important. to say emo keeping it real. the worlds collide and uh but i wanted. to say it must be hard. for people who have lost their. mothers mother's day must be hard. for people who have lost their. mothers especially if it just happened. this is your first mother's day. where you don't have your mom. it's got to. be hard and nobody ever [ __ ] talks about that. nobody ever talks about those people or how it might be hard. and nobody ever talks about that. and and it's probably still hard. even if you lost your mom. 20 years ago mother's day is a reminder. that you your mom isn't alive. on this earth anymore. and that's that's got to. be hard and i just wanted to. say because i put on my instagram. story and after i did i was like i don't hear. too many people talking about that. so i wanted to. say this on a larger platform here. this podcast and um i just wanted to. say that i'm thinking about you guys. too um and i'm sure it's bittersweet because you have fond. memories of your moms and all that stuff. uh but uh anyway uh let's get into. some silly goose time because that was very. emo and very real um and i just wanted to. also talk about my dude. i was at my parents. place for actual mother's day and i don't need the phone up there because i have the notes here um i was at my parents. place for actual mother's day and my dad made pasta. now my dad does cooking. in the family and my dad. rips it cooking dude. it really does he makes a good. pasta sauce and that is so new jersey. you know uh his pasta. sauce is good dude. it gets you here it gets. you right here his gravy. the gravy he makes uh it's so new jersey. to call pasta sauce. gravy makes you think you think a [ __ ] turkey gravy. all over the pasta it'd be so [ __ ] gross. and and a pizza pie. ew anyway he makes a great. gravy sauce you understand. sorry little kids but i'm gonna be i'm gonna kill. a clown today anyway um my dad. makes a a good [ __ ] sauce and he made it and he killed that. [ __ ] sometimes he puts meatballs in it but sometimes he's filling it a little bit and he'll put sausage in it and sometimes he's feeling it a bit more and he'll put steak in it he'll put chunks of steak. just in the pasta and if you're not italian. or if you're not familiar with pasta. uh like my exgirlfriend just didn't like pasta. and i was just like excuse me are you. human but she just didn't like pasta. that much and i have another buddy. who pretends he doesn't like. it because he likes to. have sixpacks he's like i don't like pasta. i ate enough when i was a kid. and i'm just like you're making excuses. just say you don't want to. eat it because you want that. washboard tummy so if you're one of those people if you're not one of those if you're one of those people that doesn't really live by the pasta. you know my family we ate pasta. every other day but dude. um we ate uh you can throw steak. and pasta but you might be like steak. chunks a steak. and pasta yeah it's good. it was mother's day my dad. was doing something special so he was putting chunks of steak. and sausage in bow tie. pasta all right that's what he did. with his [ __ ] beautiful gravy you understand. so we get to. the house i noticed the chunks of steak. and the sausage and the pasta. and i'm like damn so i took some out. of the bowl and i put three pieces. of sausage in my bowl. with my pasta okay and i went to. bring it back down. to the table and eat it. now i watch my dad. take a bunch of [ __ ] pasta a bunch of pieces of steaks. and some sausage put in the bowl. i go sit goes to. sit down and as he's walking down. i say hey um how many pieces. of meat do you think you like to. have in each bowl of pasta. and he says i have no idea. this is the thing here where what with with. just it sets me apart. from my dad like if you were to. meet me and then see my dad. out somewhere you'd be like that's crystalline. his dad he just looks like me. a lot and even more than that. he acts like me but this. is the part where it's like. he was the teacher. and he taught me and i'm the student. and i surpassed it because this dude. my dad would definitely get on. somebody for saying the wrong thing. or not being specific enough. but not as much as me so now. i'm so he says i have no idea. and i'm just like how could you eat pasta. with chunks of meat in it. and not know how many pieces. of meat generally you might like in each bowl. okay and i said and i left. it alone i left it. alone because sometimes kristen talks. to me about my tone. and i'm like i don't want to. be doing the tone let's learn. from this experience and let's not talk about let's not push you understand. but i want to. know right that's where i get into. trouble that's where your boy. gets into trouble when we're hanging. out having a good time somebody does something it's not specific enough. and i ask them. about it and then they say something. that's still not specific enough and then i get this. but okay but i want to. know that's when your boy is on. a slippery slope okay so why back off because kristen's there and even though. yeah sure i got my my brother. there that's definitely willing to. back me up because he's very specific too uh i back. off and i chill. and i'm like you know. what i got my son. here let's just be a family. so we sit down. and we're eating pasta and everyone's having a good. time your boy can't drop it. your boy can't drop the feeling. your boy cannot drop the feeling. my dad lied my dad. lied to me in my head. my dad lied to. me he said he never thought. about how many pieces. of meat that he would want in the [ __ ] pasta. okay so i'm eating the [ __ ] thing and i'm eating and i'm eating my sausage. and i'm like that's the first piece. you know i'm eating this. thing i'm eating the [ __ ] pasta and i go there's the second piece that i knew i put in there all right. cool i got one more piece because i know three pieces. are in there you put three to. four pieces of meat. in the [ __ ] pasta when the bowls are this size so i say hey dad you know when you said you put a bunch when i asked you how many pieces of meat goes in a bowl. of pasta you said you have no. idea and he's just eating the [ __ ] just he says yeah and i'm like well but what what do you mean. you have no idea that there. is how many pieces. of meat would be in the bowl. and he just goes like this. and he kind of like giggles. a little bit but he's like can i just eat my [ __ ] pasta. and i'm just like yeah but certainly there's a difference. between one piece of meat. in the bowl of pasta. [laughter] and 25 pieces. of meat in the bowl of pasta. right and he says yeah i said would you put 25. pieces of meat in a bowl. of pasta and he was like that. would just be a bowl. of meat and i said okay. so you know not to. do that right and he said yeah. and i i and i said what about. 24 and he said that's too. much i said well what about. 23 and he said that's too. much and i said 22. and i went down i got to. about 19 and he says i just don't want. are you going to. keep going down the whole time. i don't want to. and i was like because you know there's a number that matters. there's a number of pieces. of meat in one pasta. bowl that matters where you. go like this okay yeah that's not too much. so now we got a number dude. we got a number is it. nine is it eight. is it five because i looked down. and i counted i said. how many pieces of meat. you got and he says i don't know. um well i ate three and there's four left. so i said wow. so seven's a lot. he said yeah i said did you know. you put seven in there. and he said nah. i didn't think about it. and i said that. is absolutely bonkers to. me man you can make the bowl the way. you want to. make it and then eat it. the way you want to. eat it but you don't even. [ __ ] think about that huh. and he said no he said i don't give a [ __ ] and i was like that. is unbelievable matt what do. you think about that because i'm in a round. table discussion now it's [ __ ] live and in charge with bill. maher or whatever. the [ __ ] his show is called what's it called real time yeah real time live and in charge dude so i'm talking and i say matt and he says what and i said what do you think and he says oh yeah no i mean i think that's crazy and he said and he's i said well how many pieces of meat do you think should go in a bowl and he said about four and i said that's about how many pieces of meat i think should be in a pasta. bowl and uh basically dude. don't live a life. where you don't know. how much pieces of meat. you want in a [ __ ] bowl that you're gonna put in your body dude. well i'm getting a sandwich well. hey what kind of sandwich. you want a turkey sandwich. that's what he would say. so what kind of [ __ ] although oh i'm just gonna get you a pastrami sandwich and give you that if you don't give a [ __ ] what's going on in the bowl that you're gonna put in your body i let it go ish you know we talked a little bit about it but i let it go ish and um we agreed. to disagree because i'm learning. your boy is learning. the bad coffee the bad. coffee it's caramel. flavored [music] we [ __ ] hate caramel. flavor we like regular coffee. and i drank it and it's caramel. flavor last time it was cinnamon. cinnamon flavor and before. that i asked her. to get the regular flavor. and she didn't get it. and i had cinnamon flavor. and i didn't like it. and i said well make sure to. get the regular flavor and she didn't get it. and now i have camera mouth. flavor whoa it is. the leagues above that cinnamon [ __ ]. dude dude and before she made it for me. thank you very much by. the way i love that. you did that and since i'm working on. myself and i'm a good person. now i really appreciate that. you made that coffee and i think about it. sometimes i think about all of the things that you do. and thank you you're a great. mom you're a great partner. and you're just great. you know i have a rule when somebody asks me something. twice and i respond. twice that's the end of that. phase of the conversation so she said. well i didn't get the real the right. coffee you like and i said still. and she said yeah and i said all right. well [ __ ] whatever who cares but i i'm not having that cinnamon. [ __ ] she says well look we've got caramel. and cinnamon and i go. god that's so awful. and i said i want the caramel. and she said you shouldn't. want the cinnamon i was like man. what the [ __ ] is cinnamon cinnamon. coffee is awful. dude you might as well have [ __ ] peptobismol coffee and um so she says well okay do you want to. have it um do you want. me to put sugar. and milk in it. it'll

bit of cream. and it'll still taste a lot. better and i said nah. i don't want that thanks. thanks though and she says if i put a little bit. of sugar and just a little bit of cream. are you sure you don't want that. and i looked at her. for a while and then i went about my business. i didn't answer it a third. time because i answered it. twice and then she said you're so [ __ ] rude i think i was

fine. i guess it'll be fine. um i woke up the next morning. my throat was dry i thought about it. i thought about a little bit too. much so uh and then i thought i was maybe getting hype. covered but it's okay. even if i do have it. it's fine because i got double vaccinated. some people never have fun. you know what i'm talking. about or actually some people just never laugh. and those people are the weirdest [ __ ] people to. me like what about like what about like rappers for real. what about rappers do. you ever like i mean some rappers of course. they have a sense. of humor but you know. who i'm talking about like the rappers who. are you who are just like knobby. you know what i mean. like what about that guy. what about laughing so hard. that you want to. piss yourself nabi knobby i ain't. in all that and you're like i'm just [ __ ] making fun. of the way you eat french. fries na b not around here you know nah b that's that's that's for you man. that's for you dog that's for you. y'all want to. do that on your own. time that's fine but nah. nah not here not here. at the rocky cola cafe while. i'm eating my fries. dog and you're just like what. about laughing though. dude i know comedians that don't laugh. like [ __ ] famous ones i've never heard them laugh. loud ever and i'm around. them all the time because i was at the clubs and [ __ ] and they just are just you make jokes and everyone's laughing from the biggest comedian. to the smallest comedian. but one of them is just like nah. b and he'll be nameless because i'm not gonna [ __ ] call him out. because we don't tattletail on. this [ __ ] you know what i'm talking about uh anyway dude here comes the comments who do you think the comedian. was the news i think it. was this guy i think was that guy. it wasn't any of the ones. you're [ __ ] thinking of you're always wrong whenever i see those comments. you're always [ __ ] wrong um who do you think he's talking about when he was how he got the how we got how he got backstabbed who do you think it was some guy's just like i think it was tom papa it's just not you're never right. i tell you what dude. i'll tell you what i'm thinking. of right now and what i've been thinking of and i want. to say this with no irony. uh no funny business. uh i want to. be honest about this. and i think it might come to. a it might be uh shocking to. some people but i really mean this when i say this. i am a big fan. of the paul brothers i am. a fan of logan. paul and i am a fan. of jake paul okay period. that's it no cap okay. it's lit it's so [ __ ] lit and uh they are what they are doing is so [ __ ] dope it's illegit and i will tell you a lot of you aren't in on the joke. you don't get what they're doing. but these [ __ ] made it they did it by tricking. you dude they're good at what. they do they work hard. as [ __ ] and you [ __ ] are getting mad when you just don't get it they're performance artists. dude i have been a logan. paul fan for a while. now i didn't know much. about jake paul up until. uh the fight he won. good for him wasn't rigged. people are like it's rigged. nah i'm not buying. that [ __ ] he [ __ ] punched him and the guy fell down all right you win logan works. harder [ __ ] he's gonna fight. floyd mayweather dude he made it that's the best. boxer arguably in history okay greatest of all time. and this youtuber worked hard. and did what he did. and now he's fighting. floyd mayweather okay he's opening. up pokemon cards and [ __ ] and being like these ones are do you dude he found an alley. a niche he found a uh a creak in the door. and busted it why the [ __ ] open now obviously i made the joke. about the [ __ ] twitter thing years ago. about how uh when you die. film it on youtube. whatever the [ __ ] and uh about the guy dying and i i actually wish i didn't do that because that was just adding to. the [ __ ] um mob the guy already felt bad. himself um had i known what. i know now i wouldn't have done. that but you know he uh is a good dude. i met him uh a few times he was. at the comedy store uh all around. good dude uh but this is about jake paul. i didn't know much about jake paul. until the fight he won. the fight i was like okay. cool he beat a fighter uh. but the thing that made me go. all in with jake paul happened. the other day with the floyd mayweather fight. sorry the conference where they call. it the [ __ ] weighin was it the weighin i don't know whatever press. conference when logan was at the press. conference with floyd mayweather and logan. was just like a pig and [ __ ] he was like i can't believe i'm up. here this is awesome. i can't believe by the way. logan's like got this attitude. i already won and he did. who cares if he [ __ ] loses. against the greatest boxer of all. time who cares didn't i mean. to be like [ __ ] chubby checkers fought muhammad. ali who gives a [ __ ] and uh who gives a [ __ ] if he loses he already won. and so uh so jake paul is. there and he's like face. to face with floyd mayweather and they're arguing first of all. if you're floyd [ __ ] mayweather why are you arguing any at all ever anywhere. you your life you you're the top. you're the best at what you do. you wear monochromatic outfits and you have 14. million dollar watches do you know. what i mean and these jake pulls. in his face like [ __ ] you this
