 oh i've never talked about this. and i watch the show and i always wanted. to talk about on the podcast. do you guys watch the narcos. do you why you laughing. dude narcos okay look first of all the guy. who plays [ __ ] pablo. escobar on narcos i'm telling you. right now that's the best. acting i've seen in years dude. he's pablo escobar and i don't even mean. he's the real pablo escobar. i mean he created a [ __ ] character. even though there's a real pablo. escobar he made this guy on tv. pablo escobar maybe he's not like the real pablo. escobar doesn't matter that guy. in his head is literally thinking i'm not the actor i'm this. guy but then he forgets that. and just as that guy. that acting that that guy. does as pablo escobar. has not been seen since like early. robert de niro [ __ ] i mean. he's so good dude. he is so [ __ ] good and there is and i love that i love the show. it takes a little bit getting. into because the [ __ ] voiceover dude. did they use the voiceover. they have the guy the white. guy whatever the [ __ ] that guy is who played the bad guy in the the logan movie whatever his name is who the voiceover. everybody's good but the voiceover. like all this guy talks about is hey we like every it's the most unnecessary. voiceover that's the thing i don't get about that. show is it could just be the show. now there's a thing in writing and in screenwriting. where they say like any you can make any movie. without the voiceover and it's better. if you don't but all the best. movies that you ever [ __ ] have watched have voiceover on it. so it's kind of like it's kind of like a [ __ ] thing like you they say in screenwriting when you when you learn it. like you never need to. have a voiceover you can. always like but voice all the best. movies have voiceovers on it. i can't even think of one. right now goodfellas as far. back as i can remember i always wanted. to be a gangster and then beanie. sigel put it on his album. and he started do rappers [ __ ] italian. gangster [ __ ] man you seen too many movies that's why tupac said that but no when [ __ ] beanie sigel came out. with an album he took us to. he like took a page. from the good fella says and. he says as far as back. as i could remember i always want to. be a gangster as far. as back he says hey saddam as far. back as i remember i could always want it. to be a gangster but boyd what's his. name boyd is that the guy. donald pierce oh no no. that's him yet that's the narcos. guy right so he's good i'm not saying he's not good but he's good in the [ __ ] show he's great. but i like the guy he's awesome. the voiceover dude. is hilarious though it's unnecessary. and it's said describing it's like it's like what. narcos didn't know was we were. two steps ahead of them. well what the narcos didn't know. was we were we were always two. steps ahead of him. but then what we didn't realize was that. the narcos were four steps behind us. so we had to. go six steps back now. in miami two steps were way. different than what it was. down in colombia we were we were. used to two steps in miami. but two steps in colombia was technically. one and a half steps. due to the elevation and drug trafficking we had to. do math and make sure that every one and a half. steps we took was actually two steps. this is the way we got ahead. of the narcos and you're just like uh. okay it's just showing [ __ ] scrolling shots of like cocoa. leaves pablo asked i didn't realize as we had him right where we wanted but what we didn't realize was that pablo had us right where he wanted before that so what we had to. do was jockey around and move. positions without letting him. know but also we had to. keep him right where we wanted. and that was how we got the jump. on narcos but we got the jump. on them but what we didn't realize was. that they were underwater and you can't. jump in water so what we had to. do was you guessed it. drain the narcos pool and you're just like uh okay. and then they [ __ ] stabbed somebody in the face and you're like oh she was good you see we didn't realize that. the narcos had private jets. and they were taking the all the all the coke. from one area to. another so when we got to. the area they were already somewhere. else and even though. we had him right. where we want it. we realized one thing where we wanted. wasn't actually where we needed. uh then they [ __ ] stabbed somebody in the [ __ ] and make him eat it you see the narcos were funny. not funny like haha but the kind of funny. will you just sit back. and you look and think damn that's funny. so taking two steps every one and a half. steps and the elevation taken. into account because columbia was a lot lower than miami. we were used to. three feet above sea level. but where the narcos. were or ten feet below. sea level so what we had to. do was get taller. guys oh you see when the narcos. came it changed everything. everything from buying selling the government killing winning. baseball shirts running aliens sky and all those. things were two steps ahead. of us and then somebody gets [ __ ] shot in the [ __ ] eye you see what the narcos. didn't know was that's every [ __ ] in the beginning. of every monologue in the voiceover. you see what we didn't know. you see what the narcos. didn't know was you see what. paul didn't remember you. see what my wife didn't realize was. you see what the oneyearold baby. we just adopted from. the narcos didn't know was googoo. gaga [laughter] now the baby. said googoo gaga we didn't know. what he meant but what we didn't realize was the narcos. knew exactly what baby. talk was so we got an informant we got someone. who could understand baby talk. and his name was poison. we got poison talking. to that baby baby would say. googoo gaga poison and poison. would ship 20 kilos back. to miami that's how the operation. was we had him right. where we wanted and then they [ __ ] stretched someone's limb. so hard that their shoulders. come out of their sockets the voiceover. a narcos dude [ __ ] we all had sneakers. on i feel like that in the middle. of that show there could be a voiceover. where the guy just for no. reason said we all had sneakers. on during this scene. and you just would literally not. even realize it and you'd be and then they'd [ __ ] somebody would like [ __ ] like rape someone and then stab them in the head and then you'd be like wow this shows [ __ ] gritty you notice the narcos wearing. sneakers we all had sneakers oh no. get away from me no it shows. gritty that guy is blue. eyes
