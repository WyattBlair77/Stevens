[ __ ] idea dude and i'm not gonna pretend like i did because i read a [ __ ] article at the on the atlantic it's so annoying dude do you re whenever someone says do your research i write them off i'm done nope nope i'm done oh why cause you did it cause you did it guy in a [ __ ] billabong shirt and cargo shorts oh cause you did it i don't know i love doing this podcast patreon dot comcrystal no ads and also the whole. episode the rest of the episode. we do this cup for youtube. but um appreciate you if you're a patreon. member if not we appreciate you. all so it doesn't matter. we appreciate it appreciate no. matter what but uh yeah man. i wanna oh you know. what i wanna talk about is. uh i went to. the haha cafe the other day. i wanna i wanna talk about the haha. cafe in north hollywood california. it's on lancashire it's a such a great. i started doing standup there. that was where my first show. was um in um [music]. in uh in l.a and it was such a great. place for young comedians to. come up and do standup. and get stage time and really cultivate like their jokes. and i did there a lot. of people think i came up. through the comedy store and i did. but that was like i always felt like the when i started doing. standup that was the open. mic [ __ ] the haha was the place and then i very quickly went to. the comedy store and that's when i really like cut my teeth. but but the haha cafe was the place where i would go and i would go every day. and i would start doing the open. mics every day and it's such a great place and i haven't been back uh for probably 10 years and i just you know my buddy was going over there. why don't you come. and it's a new place. it's down the block. now it's got a new uh new uh venue. uh that's even that's nicer. and i didn't know i hadn't been to. it and i went there. and i saw terry who owns the um who owns the club and it was so nice to. see her man she's such a sweet. lady and i gave her a big. hug and i just wanted to. shout out the haha cafe. because i went on stage. there and it was cool. i went on stage. i was just it was a popin. um i wasn't even planning on. really going up but um it was a show. with a lot of young. comedians and it was nice to. watch them do standup. because it reminded me. when i first started you know. and in a lot of ways. i still feel like i'm [ __ ] figuring out as a standup. comedian like a lot of comedian. that people always ask me. like when did you make it or when did. you realize you're you could do standup. and i always answer like i'll let you know. because um it's a constant you know. game or profession of evolution you know if i watch my old [ __ ] which i don't i don't even watch it really period. but like i don't even know. if i've ever seen i think i saw a man. on fire but i don't i haven't seen my last. one it's just it's just i don't like to. watch it because i just it's done. after i shoot it. but it's a process and it's an evolution and um so i was watching these young. guys and and i decided to. go up and and i went up. and when i went up it. was kind of emotional for me. man because like i started there. and now here i am. back there and these other guys are now. in this situation and this. position that i was in when i first started. and it was just a really nice night. for me man um i felt like i got back. to my roots and it. felt really good and i just wanted to. shut that club out because a lot of people talk. about the comedy store. a lot of people talk. about the laugh factory a lot. of people talk about the improv. in la um but there's a fourth club and it's the haha. cafe and it's a great [ __ ] club especially for young upandcoming comedians man. and they do weekends too they got big. guys there but like i don't know man. every now and then there's a special night. there at the haha cafe and it's really [ __ ] cool uh so support that club if you're in north hollywood um cause i love it. and it was nice to. go back there and to. see everybody again i'm back. i went to. the bathroom you know. uh bathrooms haven't been so good. for me lately i'll be honest. with you guys i'm going. to be brutally honest. with you guys and it's probably because of all of the uh man. i had been good with my diet. for a while because also you know. how hard i work out. and [ __ ] carry weights. around and and how stupid i go. with the kettlebells and i'm so sorry. to break your heart. strong guys but i do. i [ __ ] get really elevated. and super angular with the kettlebells. and it goes and you know. you know i go [ __ ] nutso with those but i um i've also been taking and eating a lot of [ __ ] pizza i don't know if it's because i've been thinking about papa john. a lot lately but god damn. i eat so much pizza it's [ __ ] ridiculous. and one of my friends. is like you know pizza is. not really that bad for you. it's got a good balance. of protein and this and that if you get the right. things on it and i'm like i let that i let myself. be tricked by that. and i just get pizza man. and i got a pizza the other day. and i got dominoes and if somebody's gonna slander domino's i'm gonna be all pissed off. and you don't want that. you don't want me. to be pissed off. if you're gonna be slandering dominoes and then you come talk to. me and be like you know. pizza hut's better i'm done. with you dude i'm absolutely done. with you i'm absolutely done. with you it's like you're saying do your own. research because to. me that makes you a [ __ ] because domino's is the [ __ ] and yeah i get it there's other better. pizza out there but when it's midnight. there's kind of mostly not. so we got domino's and kristen. was like what do you want. to get and i was like i want. a pizza with pepperoni and she's like okay. can we get half of it. and i say whoa. whoa let me stop you right. there whatever you want to. get you get that on top. of the pepperoni pizza that. i want and she was like but i want some and i said whoa. let me stop you right there. i want all of it. i want all of it. and i forced myself oh. i forced myself to. get thin crust okay because i'll tell you right. now i'll eat a whole goddamn pizza i'll eat. a whole goddamn pizza and i'll try to. do it slowly but i won't i'll eat a whole goddamn pizza. very very fast. [music] and i did it. and i tried to. do it slowly and i was doing it. while i was on flex. avenue playing video games. on twitch i did it. but i [ __ ] did it slowly. because i was in between. shooting civilians in the game and taking chops of [ __ ] pepperoni pizza if you can't eat a whole. pizza you ain't [ __ ] dude. kristen looked at me. she's like i can't believe i ate half. a pizza and that was crazy. for her duchess about 110 pounds. that was not so not so for her. but my god dude i built like a [ __ ] sturdy house i ate the whole thin crust. pizza and that was nothing. dude i forced myself to. get it i could eat a whole pizza. how much a matter of fact. how much pizza is there. okay that's that's the amount i'll have you order. for you we're never doing this. let's order for everyone type [ __ ] dude. because then i got to. feel like an [ __ ] where i'm eating most of the stuff. i'll get what i need and you get what. you need and we'll all be happy. dude and if you have some leftovers i'll eat that. too the only reason i didn't eat kristen's. leftovers was because she i didn't i don't like [ __ ] cheese pizza what a waste dude. jeez you're not gonna get some [ __ ] nice saltiness on. it with the [ __ ] pepperoni you're not gonna put any mushrooms. on it no supreme shits. no i'm not a meat lovers. dude because i don't like to. get interracial with my meats. man i do not like to. get interracial with my meats. dude sausage is for sausage. pizza [ __ ] pepperoni is for pepperoni pizza meat lovers where it's got sausage. and pepperoni and then because they call it. meat lovers they have to. add other meats. in it that aren't even good on. [ __ ] pizza like meatball dude. meatballs its own thing okay don't put a meatball on a [ __ ] pizza that's like putting spaghetti on a pizza how funky in italian. can you be at a certain point. you get too italian. you're not italian anymore. so like cheese is a waste that's a wash. you know what i mean. you might as well just get bread. but you put that pepperoni on there. you throw [ __ ] tree some places. they skimp out you know they put [ __ ] one or two pepperoni slices on the pizza the [ __ ] out of here maron you put [ __ ] nine piece you put [ __ ] you split it up i tell you what you put four and you put four another one or you put nine on two right you split it up and you cut it right down the center when you're making the slices mod that's the way i like my pizza dude [music] um so anyway that was really important because so now anyway my my poopies are horrible because i ate a whole.
