tan. background and that's what's up. and that's what's up this. week that's what's gonna be what's up. with this week but i got shows. in seattle coming up. there's still a little tickets. left on my saturday show we added. that recently and then i'm going. to spokane those are all. sold out because probably cuz snuffing doing. spoke and also take the e. off the end of that [ __ ] city. so it can just be spoke spokane. and people want say spokane and you won't have to. get mad it because people hate when you say spokane mmhmm but anyway it's episode 107. and i can't believe we're doing it. and we got a guest. coming up we got our first. guest confirmed besides my brother. or as my mom would say. for some reason bralla she says that sometimes and instead of san diego she says san diego. as a to. be to be funny now. she's a crazy person she also calls me. brother maffei and meet crinks for some reason. and i don't know why. but whatever we're gonna you know. she's 70 and she just people. just get crazy as they get older. they get so much. like themselves they can't they can't. handle it that's that's why. you basically are an actor in a movie. you become an actor in a movie. that is undirected that's what you become. it's like it's like when when when denzel or al. pacino is in a movie with some young. director that has no vision and they're just like oh i'm gonna walk. all over them that's what your [ __ ] mom and dad become and then you're like al do you maybe want to. do it a different way. and he goes like this. i've been in this business. for a long time no and then it just like okay. and then he just walks all. over him and then al pacino. as one of the worst. performances that he's ever had in his career. so basically your parents become someone who are if you don't direct them. enough they will be the worst. they will be performing the worst. in their entire lives so my mom. it's a san diego and that. don't correct her but also it's funny. so my mom is basically al. pacino as well i'm second but oh i have been on i've been home. this past week which is feeling. like happening it's happening. less and less frequent i enjoyed my time. home in los angeles and i got some heavy road. dates coming up soon. which is just a lot. i might have to. turn down some [ __ ] gigs that this college gig it's hard to. turn down work man. but i want to. be home sometimes you know. hmm i got into. the show the assassination of gianni. versace god what an italian. name jenna versace and it's an i didn't even realize it wasn't in crime story because i saw the oj1 mmm as good as a kubla gooding jr. cuba gooding jr. is and that guy is a [ __ ] amazing actor he really is i worked with him it's a [ __ ] but i did and he's just great um i did a movie with him
