you know i want to. be uh appreciative to. you guys uh i'm feeling good. about life i'm feeling grateful. um you know some days are a struggle. and um you know i think about mental. health a lot more lately. um and uh you know it's uh it's hard. i let the stuff get to. me sometimes in the world and um just want to. be a [ __ ] somebody that uh does you know does the right. thing does good in the world. and it's a [ __ ] you know it's tough dude. you know i want you know. what i want to. be for real i decided this the other day. i want to. be religious i want to. be a guy who's like uh uh like believes. in god and just goes to. church sometimes and but he's like one of those. cool dudes that's like yeah you know. you don't have to. believe in god but i do i don't want. to have to. push it on you and [ __ ] but i want to. have i want to. believe in something man i've been thinking about this. the other day and i told my friends. and they laughed dude. and it was funny but i i meant. it dude it is funny. to hear me say. that but also i mean it. i wish there was something you know that. i could uh believe in like a higher. power you know and there is there. are like my friends or my family. you know something that's greater. than myself that i can i can i can rely on and that. can help me and those are that's my family. that's my my crew you know. um but it sucks. because no matter how much i want to. believe in god there's always that. thing that there where it's like okay. i want it to. be proven and then people are like but hey dude that's what faith. is and i'm like that just can we get a. little bit of proof though. right can we get a little bit. of proof though can one day jesus. just be like and you look over. and it's jesus and then he goes and you're like okay. i well okay i have faith. i have faith and then religious people will. be like but that's not faith. though because you saw jesus. and then you'll say stuff. to like religious people. like well i've never seen jesus. and then i'll be they'll say some annoying. ass [ __ ] like what can you see air. but you know it's there and you're just like jesus. christ okay i can't talk to. you but all of these feelings how could you feel. all these feelings without a jesus. how could you feel all of these. feelings without a higher. power and you know what dude. maybe and i'm not the guy who's like no. no no no there's no jesus. or there's no god i should stop saying jesus. there's different religio uh religions. there's no god right i can't. say there's no god how the [ __ ] do i know who the [ __ ] do i think i am to. know about that whoa he's starting. off hot but i want to. be religious hey dude i want to. jump in the lake right. i want to. put all my clothes in and jump. in the lake and i have another man. pet my head i guess i'm just not there. yet man i hope i am really because you see. religious people around and they're [ __ ] you know they got their their battles and [ __ ] but they walk around and they know something else is out there and maybe it's not but they know it is and that's good enough for them dude and here's the other thing man i never really believed in heaven. because my idea of heaven. is you get there and you chill. and you have a good. time there's a lot of turkey sandwiches. people give you massages mostly women. and you're just kind of [ __ ] watching a bunch of tv that doesn't really matter right. not like important shows like. [ __ ] in the lexicon like game of thrones. like you're watching fear thy. neighbor or you know some dumb. documentary that has four episodes. about like game stop you're watching that. but kristen's idea of heaven. is not that it's like there's there's we're not watching. that she's like scrolling through. tick tock and like the house. is decorated in a way. that i don't want it. to be so how the [ __ ] are we gonna be there together don't husbands always want to. be in heaven with their wives. i mean probably not but i do so what is it. say you got eight kids. and you love all of them. but two of them. hate you you want them. in heaven they don't want to. be in your heaven. so then what but i want to. believe it dude my buddy. said to me one time. you know because a lot of people are like well when you get to. heaven you get to. have all the the women you want and all the sex. you want and then my buddy. said dude when i get to. heaven i want that sexual. urge removed from me. i want to. be stressfree and i was like that's the ticket. dude that's the ticket. man that's my heaven. but i don't really believe in heaven. and i want there to. be a heaven. dude but that's the thing. about religion even if there is no. heaven who's it hurting. besides all the [ __ ] wars and [ __ ] you know what i mean besides the people literally dying and [ __ ] like literally being [ __ ] shot and burned and [ __ ] cut off their heads and all the wars through all of humanity besides that the daytoday [ __ ] of it when you're running into. a religious guy he's not a piece. of [ __ ] he's just living his own. life smiling it's a very convoluted and intricate. thing to think about at. least for me man. but i'm a dumb ass. i just wish there was something. out there that i could [ __ ] really get behind man. you know and it's my kid. right but he's real i can see him. right there i don't know it's just what i've been thinking of lately. man you know and then i [ __ ] get into. the car on the way. back from the doctors and the valet. guy that brought it like is. like have a good day. and i'm like i'm going to. give him this much of a tip. and then i go you know. what i'm actually going to. give him more of a tip. because what the [ __ ] does it. matter to me and he'll probably be more. happy so i give him more. of a tip and then i get in the car. dude and it smells like a [ __ ] department store [music]. dracar noir all over the guts. dude i swear to. god it was like he [ __ ] got ready in my car. this morning he goes [ __ ] let me get your mercedes in his mouth dude and then drove up and said thank you sir gave him a little bit more. money because what's it matter. to me and then [ __ ] got in the car and wished i didn't but ain't that just how life goes [music]. i had to open. up all the windows. and [ __ ] drive around. town um a manly cologne. is just awful i mean. all cologne and perfume. is just awful uh but i did. i went to. the doctors and um and it was uh great. dude went to the doctor dude. i got a jokey ass. doctor i'll tell you that much i got a jokey ass. doctor you ever have a jokey ass. doctor and i don't want this. [ __ ] sounds like a bit it's not a bit i'm not even going to. get into it. but i got a jokey ass. doctor and that's it i don't want to. get into it. and that's fine that's for me. to know i have that experience. with him he's a great. [ __ ] surgeon when it comes to. nasal shits cause guess. what [ __ ] yeah dude my nose is better. [applause] i thought it wasn't going. to be better and you were along. for that ride with me. weren't you you thought it might not be better. i was complaining it was hard. is it worth the i used. to when i would [ __ ] i would hold my nose like this if i i would hold my one my nostril. if i could only breathe. through this nostril with no mouth. i would end up passing out. i'd have to. release my thumb and now i can do it. for [ __ ] i can just do it i can just hold my thumb there. like that so if you see me. picture me out there like that not passing out. so he made it work. now was it worth the money. probably not but he said i'll live longer. so okay if i get to. live longer to. be with my [ __ ] you know be with the homies. then that's what's up because i don't believe. in heaven but maybe it. does exist but maybe it does. exist dude um so yeah i went in and he checked. it dude and he didn't even numb. at that time and i was so happy. dude i hate when he numbs. it i hate getting numbed up. in there up in that piece when they numb. your [ __ ] brain dude when they just stick two prongs up. there and i go what's that. and he says that's the numbing. [ __ ] and then my brain looks like [ __ ] it just oh god i hate that [ __ ] i hate it more than a surgery to. be honest surgery. you don't even feel it. you just pass. the [ __ ] out so it's all good my babies. um anyway dude so my nose is. fixed it's still tender. and i every time i ask him. why it's still tender he says. because i went in there. and i cut it up and i want more of an explanation. yes dude and every time i ask. him that's what he says because i go. in there and i cut your whole. face up he's too jokey. yes dude tell me in doctor terms well. the reason is because the capillaries and this and that. and then i gotta i ended up you know. what it feels like when you get the nose. surgery the uh what is it. called not [ __ ] cynoplasty what did i get cyno something. not rhinoplasty sinus whatever. the [ __ ] it is cyanoseptic septic sino septic tank. septoplasty got it [ __ ] yeah septoplasty got it with no help. um septoplasty and you know what it. feels like dude for those of you that. need to get it. because a lot of you apparently. 85 people have deviated septums. oh oh oh it's too many. people what's everyone running. the [ __ ] into. what did i run. into i don't know i have no idea what i ran. into i said was i born like this. and he said no nobody's born. like that and i said i ran. into something with my face. and he said yes and i said i don't remember he said well. that's what happened so i go. okay my brother has it. too and i know why. because he ran into. another person's [ __ ] the back. of his head and that's why. he has it but 85 percent. of the people have it that. doesn't mean you need to. have surgery right god damn. i talk so fast. dude but um that doesn't mean. you need to. have surgery but what it does. mean is you might need to. have surgery right and i [ __ ] uh it's uh you know it feels like you know what it feels like after like a month and a half of it it. feels like you know when you floss your teeth. that's the kind of pain you have. in your in your nose. and that's awesome it feels. good because it feels. good when you brush your teeth. so it feels good. in my nose now i don't know. if everyone has that experience but i told him. that he goes yeah. yeah that is how it feels. anyway dude whatever he said his family. came to my shows. and i had no [ __ ] idea and he was like i didn't want to. tell you because i didn't want you. to just fillet him. he kept saying what did. he say i didn't want him. to [ __ ] i didn't want you. to fillet him what was it. fellaium i think that's what he was saying. but he kept saying he's like because i got a lot. of comedian patients that come in here. and i send my family. to their shows and they just absolutely fillet. them i didn't want to. make you wig out and i'm like yeah no it's all good it's just a job but he's a good doctor shout out to. the doctor in this theory um so yeah. you know i don't know man. i was on uh i was actually on uh i was on rick glassman's podcast. taking shoes off uh and it's out there. now and it's uh it came out. already because this will be out. and it was really good. to sit down and talk to. him man i love that. dude you should go check out. that podcast actually you know. what rick is one. of the silliest dudes i know and i would say he thinks probably i'm one. of the silliest dudes he knows. and we started a little bit. silly but boy did we actually. get [ __ ] not so silly man. didn't expect for that to. happen you know what's weird. too about these podcasts let. me tell you what's weird. about these podcasts like we do. podcasts comedians they'll do each other's podcast. and [ __ ] and thank god sometimes. it's like such a hustle. it's like okay i'll do yours. you do mine it's so. [ __ ] annoying i think i don't have any guests. i don't have to. have people on here but also like these podcasts. they're the only like they're the only times these comedians talk. to each other you know the rest of the time. they're just talking at each other or like hey how you doing. what'd you have for dinner. this is the longest. conversation rick lastman i would consider him. a pretty damn good friend. i've known him for 15. years and i haven't [ __ ] had a conversation with him like this in forever. an hour no an hour. and 40 minutes we talked um so yeah. i took calvin over to. [ __ ] i was with kristen and i took calvin. over to color me mine. you know what color me. mine is um it's one of those places. where you can uh go in and pick a like a ceramic. thing well and they got all sorts. of ceramic things like anything. from like ceramic spiders. to like coffee mugs to. like um uh a vase to. a hat you know you know not a hat. you wear but like a ceramic hat. that you would paint anything. they have flowers they have little village like mushroom. cottages and [ __ ] and um kristen was like i'm gonna take calvin to. color me mine and it's one. of those things where i'm like oh that's cool. that's like a mommy son thing. but also i secretly think she wants to. go to color me. mine because she loves to. do crafts but it's a good thing. for them to bond with and also i want. my son to be [ __ ] i mean my son what boy he's laser. focused when he's drawing that. [ __ ] it looks like he's trying to. find an antidote for aids. or some [ __ ] i mean he's just serious. will you put him an etchasketch in front of him. i mean my god dude. it's like he's [ __ ] um tommy lee jones. and been blown away. trying to make the last bomb. i mean he's [ __ ] with just classical. music you know in the background oh so anyway. she was like you want to. join us and i was like you know. what dude yes i do yes i do i want to. join you and paint with my son. now is this something that four years. ago chris leah would have done. or would have thought he would have done. will crystallia have thought oh in four. years i'm gonna go to. color me mine with my family. no but i did and i went and i showed up. and i said calvin. what do you want to. paint and he said i want. to paint this and picked up a [ __ ] ceramic spider and i said are you sure and he goes yes and he says oh and he looks over at a vase and he says look at that and i said is that you want to. put what you want to. paint and he picked up the spider. and he said no i'll paint. this and i said oh okay. cool and then he looks at. the skull and he says oh look. at that dada and i said very cool. skull huh and then he picks it. up and says i'll paint this. so now i'm like hey stop getting [ __ ] distracted. and pick something because i want. you to i want you. to paint what you want. to paint being a kid. is the [ __ ] you know you just do [ __ ] until you want to. do something else right. isn't that it you're just [ __ ] doing [ __ ] until something else you get a hankering. for something else right. like the other day. my son ate candy and then turkey hey guy that's [ __ ] disgusting. don't the sweets deteriorate your tongue. and then you want cold. cuts you want to. [ __ ] dude we got these like you you want these you want those [ __ ] sour pumpkins those sour pumpkin. those sour patch pumpkins. and then turkey and mustard. what's going on in your mouth. dude but that's what he wanted. and that's what he did. so he wanted a spider. and then he said he wanted. a skull and i asked. him if he was sure three times and he said yes so we took the skull. and we brought it over. and then kristen got a [ __ ] little um what do you call it. pot that she wanted to. paint because she's like a real person. and she's thinking like i'll paint. and i'll like actually use it. in my house which i'm like she's one. of those people that go to. color me mine to. like that actually like does like work. you know so so i'm sitting there and i'm like what color. do you want buddy. and he goes that. one and he's putting all the colors and he's putting like five at the same. colors i'm like buddy. you gotta pick different colors. otherwise it's all gonna look the same. but secretly i'm kind of happy. that he's doing it because i love being monochromatic. you know me dude. i mean look at the new merch. it's fire and it's all brown. dude pants and shirt and hat monochromatic till the [ __ ] cows come home you know what i say so um so so now uh we pick different colors he starts painting the skull oh and uh and and kristen's like why don't you pick something and i go i don't i don't i'm just you know i'm along for the ride and she says it's fun and i know she means it's fun for her and i should join because it's and i'm like i don't really want to. paint something but maybe it's an experience i should have if you're like me. dude you know what's [ __ ] annoying. as [ __ ] sometimes experiences like you figure [ __ ] out your whole. life you get to. a point where you know. what's up and that's your life. and then people are like you know you should join. us on a retreat and you're like hey hey i don't do retreats. my [ __ ] is i wake up. i get coffee i eat a sandwich. i do a show and then i [ __ ] see what's up. you know i see what's up. and you know what i mean. by see what's up because five years. later i was definitely seeing what's up. right five years earlier. five years later it. went up 48. and um and so now i'm like i you know like you got to. change in life dude. if you're not changing you're it's a death. of some sort you have to. keep growing and changing. and evolving and if you don't that's a death of some sort right i i think i don't think it's literal. that sometimes it is literal. of death right what you love. what you need to. keep doing that will kill. you if you're not living right. but you need change certainly if you're not. living right but you also need change even if you're living some sort of life. that you think you figured out. and you are living right. because if you're not i feel like that's a death. of kind of exploration and creativity that maybe maybe might benefit you so i'm at color. me mine you know and maybe that's not somebody's definition. of changing their life but you know. what god dammit it is because i don't go. to color me mine. and i stepped in the place. and i stepped in a place. to watch and as a matter of fact. i'm still changing because kristen said why. don't you paint something and i said yes. so i looked at the things. on the [ __ ] shelf and i'll be goddamn there was a mug on it that said dad. so i picked up that mug and they asked what. colors i wanted and i said green and blue and there's like nine spots for colors on the [ __ ] palette thing there and they said is that it and then kristen said why don't you get more colors just in case and in my head i thought one change at a time okay and i looked at her and i said nope just blue and green thanks and i painted the cup green and the word dad blue and i did that while my son painted the skull and all he did was paint the front of the [ __ ] skull and he should have painted [ __ ] more of it [music] but you don't disturb an artist and if that's what he wanted to. do that's what he wanted. to do and yeah kristen ended up [ __ ] filling in the rest but it's okay do it wow this how it looks [ __ ] legit look how [ __ ] cool i look dude wow dude look at that hat dude so yeah man that's what's up i got a mug i don't know if i won't have it by the time this step i'll have it next episode and i'll be [ __ ] drinking out of it dude dad city it's cool man i painted the handle green too i painted the handle green and everything green i had to. go over it a few. times it's gonna look [ __ ] not so good which is like you're actually doing it really. good and i'm like i don't need that. i don't need that baby. thank you let me just paint. this i don't really need that. oh man oh [ __ ] i hit the [ __ ] thing all good saw the new [ __ ] uh oh while we were at [ __ ] i forgot about this dude while we were at um color. me mine dude there were these two. i'm gonna assume females you. know you gotta assume these you can't. assume but you gotta if you're gonna. tell a story about them. right you can't just be saying everyone's they in this. story then people are gonna be like but what were they and you're like well. i don't know and then get out. of that conversation so uh these two. fem two women i i think probably because they looked there. were women you know. i don't know i don't know what to. do to not get in trouble. two two people that were you know. two people that had tits they had tits and so and it's fine but and that's what and not even in a sexual way. they had breasts how about that. sounds sexual they had breasts so two people had breasts that. colored me mine and they were. and they were adults they were like you know. 30 painting and i was like that's sweet. that they like to. do that they meet each other. and they're at columbia mine and the two women. probably they're there and they're painting each other's [ __ ] they were painting. little like people looked like kimberly. they both picked keebler elves. houses and they were good. dude they were [ __ ] coloring it. in and killing it. and they were both wearing masks. and that was one of the reasons. why i thought maybe maybe they're women. but maybe i shouldn't assume because let's face. it dude the people who are really interested. in the pronoun stuff most of the time. we'll be wearing masks. indoors and i'm not touching like now maybe not most of the time. but i was erring on the side. of caution it doesn't really matter. to my podcast i got the fan. base it's all good and you're with me. okay but i'm gonna say that. they were probably women and i'm gonna roll. with that and the reason. why i say probably but i'm not sure. is because they had short. they both had short hair. i don't want to. say that you know that's also a stereotype. men have short hair. women have longer but that's and i get it. women could have short hair. men who have tits can have short hair. women who don't have tit you. know what i mean the whole. gamut these people had short hair. and tits is what i'm trying. to get at okay. and they were painting though. keebler ells houses and whatever. they were they were killing. it dude these shits looked like i mean. i saw kristen look over. and was like oh yeah [ __ ] probably you know what i mean. i could do oh you think oh really. okay well let me get my jar out. and paint the [ __ ] out of these diamonds on it so calvin is a very curious boy. dude it turns out i raise. very curious boys when i splurt. and they come out nine months. later they're very curious so he keeps pointing to. the woman and says really loudly. what's he making we're in a dilemma. and i say oh well that is a little mushroom. keebler else how elf house. and he goes oh and it happened ten [ __ ] times and kristen and i kept side eyeing each other. and hopefully they weren't offended. and in that sense they make sense. because there were two of them. my baby i'm just trying to. keep with the times and you know. me i'm woke as [ __ ] [music] don't some people call me a space cowboy rabbit damn damn damn help. some people call me. maurice that song sucks and everyone knows it some people call. me excited for my shows. coming up dude i'm very excited for my show. is coming up dude i do. like 50 minutes i watch a new uh house. of dragons in the new game. of thrones [ __ ] house of dragons. and [ __ ] and like i try so hard you know i'm on my tutor [ __ ] right like you know i'm on my tutor [ __ ] like i'm when i watch that [ __ ] jonathan rice reads my have two names by the way you're a kind of an [ __ ] if you're like oh you're actually it's rice in the middle reese. come on dude you know you're not actually in those. old times i get it. when you were like [ __ ] sir henry the [ __ ] yadda yadda but like come on of right. of a place start calling me [ __ ] chris of beverly hills like [ __ ] off if you know chris of beverly hills that's me dude. beverly hills crystalia of beverly. hills so uh yeah dude. so uh i'm watching so i'm like i'm on my tutor [ __ ] okay and i'm watching about it. not only do i watch about the tutors i pause it. and then i start googling. about what's going on what actually. happened with henry the eighth. right because i'm smart. i don't just sit and i watch a show. like a bear i'm smart. i do research afterwards. okay um and so i'm watching tutors and uh every time. i say tutors i think of [ __ ] people who fart like toot. i'm watching [laughter] hello. we have to behead you now. now

[ __ ] tooting going on tutors see this is why i like having a [ __ ] podcast by myself with no one else on it because they would just [ __ ] interrupt and [ __ ] and the bit would get all weird um so uh yeah if i'm on my tudor [ __ ] and then kristen's like oh that [ __ ] house of dragon [ __ ] is and i'm like what is that i was like is this a new reality show i don't even know and she's like it's that game of thrones thing but it's 300 years earlier and i'm like dude i didn't even like game of thrones now i gotta watch not even after it before it it's gonna be more boring they got less [ __ ] probably as time moves on there's more [ __ ] and i gotta watch the prequel to. something where they barely. had anything except dragons that. didn't even show up until the [ __ ] fifth season. by the way dude fourth season. whatever it was dude. i [ __ ] watched it and there were no dragons. and then by the fourth season. there was finally like one or two dragons. and i was like this. is what i've been waiting. for i'm out dude i'm out and people about to. think they're like dude. you were you you left. right when it gets good. hey four seasons if i [ __ ] order a burger. and 11 bites are. bad i'm done now keep eating. bro just wait [music]. i [ __ ] up with that. burger so i'm watching the [ __ ] uh so she's like let's put it on come on and she doesn't even want to. watch it in the [ __ ] room i want to. watch it in which is the worst. bro you know i'm like can we just watch it. with the fireplace and have it. nice we don't even. want the fireplace on. as hot as [ __ ] and our air. conditioning doesn't work but i'm like can we just have. it on the in the [ __ ] and where the fireplace. is dude and uh and she's like no i want. to watch it like where this. is and i'm like [ __ ] god and and the show i don't want to. watch but okay though dude. you know what i mean. even though we did color. me mine and i didn't really want to. do that and yes i had a good time. and a lovely time with my son. and i did that and that wasn't one. of my things that i wanted. to do yeah i still [ __ ] said okay and we watched the show in the room. that i didn't want to. watch and that's fine. but i sucked it. up and i watched it. and dude i can't i don't know what it. is about this [ __ ] i cannot pay. attention to these kinds of shows. for more than four. [ __ ] seconds it's it's like there's so much brown. in it [laughter] dude. and it's like you know there's a voiceover. for sure and then like a dragon. and then like i'm like i you know. what it's just like in the house. of dragon targaryen and that's when it. and the in 300 years and the [ __ ] and you're just watching this. [ __ ] and you're like all right okay and then a guy walks in with long as [ __ ] blonde hair. and you're like all right. no it's white sorry long. [ __ ] white hair and you're like oh cool all right. that's kind of an interesting looking. guy and then it cuts. to the other guys talking to. and the other guy's got long. as [ __ ] white hair and they just are like talking to. each other and then they say well like we have to. talk to the other guy. in the [ __ ] other room and then they go to. another room and there's [ __ ] three guys and they all got like long white hair and then a black guy comes in and he's got long white hair and i'm just like they're not nobody's gonna say anything about this. long white hair in the beginning. of i understand they live with it but say something. for us it's like when when when jason mamoe is. in a movie this is what my brother. always says but like when jason momoa is. in a movie why aren't there. at least two or three. scenes in every one of his movies. where somebody says whoa dude. you're huge you're huge let's get past. he's too big to. be in movies you know. jason momoa is going to. just like play a guy. but you're seven feet tall. 980. but you're way more than a humvee. too sorry sir you weigh. more than a than an h2. jason mamoa is so jason momoa that. one time i saw jason. momoa before he was a movie. star when i just knew about a guy. that got a part to. the new conan movie. and i saw him and i thought oh that's jason. momoa and i was right and that is the god's honest. truth dude and i was with brian. cowan and he walked up. to me he was like wow. man you're a big dude. i swear to. god you know he's obsessed with bodies. but that's what happens. when jason mama walks into. a room maybe if he's aquaman okay he's a superhero but dude. you know if he's just a guy with a gun and [ __ ] like he's in a movie with sylvester stallone. i saw on a plane one. because that is one. plane watching ass movie. dude i mean if you're gonna watch what are the most two. actors that you would watch that. would be in a movie. in a plane because that's the thing. too it's like it wouldn't be the number. one it wouldn't be like like you think of a [ __ ] a jeremy renner. movie you think oh that's a big. movie star i would go to. the movie theater for him. because i love him. right but then if you couple him. with with a certain person you might be like i'll wait for that. at home dude it's very few stars. that have that all go no. matter what right no matter who they're coupled. with like you know what i mean. wow that's [ __ ] hilarious like if you [ __ ] couple like jason if you go see jason mamon movie you might go to. the theater because it's gonna be aquaman it's gonna be whatever the [ __ ] dune if you see a sylvester stallone. movie maybe not now but back. in the day dude. you would go it would be a blockbuster i love sylvester. stallone but you put those both [ __ ] in a movie. and that [ __ ] is best seen on a screen. that's eight by 12. but jason i'm always just gonna play a guy. with a gun that walks in a warehouse. and sylvester stallone's not gonna be like whoa. this guy's really big huh. he's just gonna be like hey huh. so do it for us. house of dragons well it's because we've all got white. hair right and that's why. because we all got really really [ __ ] there was the age. of the age of of terrify. remember that when the [ __ ] when the when when the devil. himself rose up and scared. all of our ancestors and everyone went white. hair and that's what happened. and now we all have the white. hair anyway who will we be heading. [music] for real sounds just like tutors dude. chrisley dot com but yeah man. so uh i don't know man. but they you know. maybe they didn't they did. a lot of violence back. then but i don't know man. i don't know about that. house of dragons with the targaryens or whatever the [ __ ] they're called like i don't understand. that that's the thing about i don't part. of it is okay. magic i'm not really into. shows with magic all right. period the second a wizard. shows up i'm like okay unrelatable right. um or like you know. like i'm not really into. that kind of a thing i'm not into. magic i'm not into. like sorcery i'm not into. somebody who can like [ __ ] i'm not into. like a woman who predicts the future. that everybody has to. go to in a tower. to find out what's gonna happen. and also if you're gonna make up a [ __ ] like uh a com this is look the story is all [ __ ] right like it it didn't happen. right this is all [ __ ] it's from some really creatively [ __ ] guy's mind. right some real like you know just i don't know he looks like he would work at a [ __ ] hardware store that tolkien guy. or what and that's not even. him it's the other guy. but whatever um and so you're gonna make up [ __ ] right just that's what it is in its true. form it's actual [ __ ] so that's fine. but why why are you making everybody's. name so hard to. remember and and and and letters that are together. that are never together were. you like trigeria to. chair jared jiren jiren terrarian cherberian carebearian what the [ __ ] is that guy who is he again. and they all got white. hair so you don't know. who's who so like work with me. you know what i mean. if i'm gonna sit and watch the show name. him [ __ ] frank drebin hello hi frank hello todd whoa let let's let's go let's go on the [ __ ] track okay todd shall we grab lisa lisa who lisa lisa smith well yes that's right it's not that i forgot her name because it's very easy to. remember it's that i actually [ __ ] just didn't know it but like why why why because it makes it better. i guess right that's hilarious. and then they got shows like the two like the tutors where [ __ ] henry. k not henry cable he's in it. henry um harry k k. styles jonathan rhys meyers. what the [ __ ] is playing henry. the eighth and just they just didn't wear a fat. suit or dye his hair. red he was just like no. which is hilarious like hey. guy he's a real person. in history and he didn't do. [ __ ] about it just walking around all handsomely [ __ ] henry viii was a six foot three fat [ __ ] he was ugly as [ __ ] i don't know why john the reason why i was gonna play he was supposed to. put on like a fat. suit and makeup and prosthetics and he was just like nah. i'm not doing that you want. me to do the part. i'll [ __ ] do it my way and he did it and that's it and then henry cavill is in it everyone in the [ __ ] show is so attractive and let me tell you something dude i don't actually necessarily think henry cavill is my type of [ __ ] sexy right like i don't [ __ ] guys but if i was gonna henry cavill would would not be one that i did right he just seems to. much a guy that would be like on a date. and be like so what music. do you listen to. and you're just like this. hip hop hugo right. and i happen to. actually you know it's interesting. enough because i i i have been into. um dance music that has come out. uh in the late 90s. i've been really i don't know. if it's the nostalgia. of it all like and i would just be like oh dude. boner removal oh dude. induce me a little more. right make me go bracket. kagak your face works. fine let the combo initiate some brachika cack but jonathan. rhys meyer seems like a kind of a sexy dude. that i might want to. like you know do that. [ __ ] with if i did [ __ ] guys right because i'd be like on a date with him and he'd be like where the [ __ ] is the waiter and you'd be like i don't know he's coming and he's like place [ __ ] you know it's not one thing that they need to. be good at and i'm like all. right bro you got a little bit of an edge. to you don't you dude. don't you right and then you know it's [ __ ] runk city horizontally so uh yeah but you know i'm not gay so that's never gonna happen. but my point is i watched three. seasons of the tudors and i'm in first. season not gonna lie. very boring might as well be watching a [ __ ] like that tiny. desk [ __ ] or whatever the [ __ ] everyone pretends to. like right people are like oh no. but like you'll be like dude. tiny desk is hilarious they'll be. like yeah did you see the usher. one huh no no i didn't see. usher on tiny desk. did you when he goes. [ __ ] watch this that meme [ __ ] laid me out. dude when he goes watch. this dude when he did that. that meme i just go like this. oh i didn't even laugh. i go cool and a priest came over forget. it dude watch this and then the memes. were just oh my god dude. i should post some but um yeah dude. so uh i don't watch tiny. desk and i might as well. watch tiny desk if you want. to watch the first season. of the tudors but then the second. season of the tudors. finally it started getting going and that's 11. 12 episodes in and then the third season. was good you know and i'm watching henry. cavill and i'm like this. guy is a salad eating. [ __ ] you know just a [ __ ] just he's toast you know like you don't every just [ __ ] toast you gotta put butter or jam on it but this guy's just toast you know like he is good looking but everything he's you know what i mean that comes out of his aura is just like i was in a toaster for 10 seconds and that's it and you're like and then season four starts and they let his hair grow out and his beard grow out dude it's amazing what a little facial hair can do to. a guy that's [ __ ] that is a salad. eating [ __ ] i mean i wouldn't even go on a date. with him we would be on tinder. and match and then i'd go right. to his [ __ ] castle and do the runcity. i mean he looks great. okay so henry cavill hats off. to you for figuring it. out you know jonathan. rhys meyers and [ __ ] henry cavill hated the [ __ ] out of each other doing that whole thing like because they were just both two good looking dudes and henry cable really didn't give a [ __ ] but jonathan reese myers was like oh he's in the scene again all right cool oh he's oh he's in this one too great i thought he was gonna be the other old guy we could have used him but it's fine i guess it you know it doesn't matter it's my dialogue that matters can we get a stool for me to. stand on i need to. be taller than them. how much are they both. five eight dude did you watch. imagine saying someone sincerely to. someone sincerely did you see usher. on tiny desk dude. imagine actually [ __ ] having those words. come out of your mouth. towards someone else hey do you see usher. on tiny desk tiny. desk should not be as big as it. is okay first of all where are you. shooting this is this in a public. library and why is usher. mac miller john mayer and [ __ ] you know uh uh katy perry doing. this why isn't it people. like nelly furtado and again. where are you filming this. it's i don't i'm not i mean. oh sure dude watch this. these are my confessions and energy. zones and broken chains. and vengeance in the freakings and zones. and my confessions does anyone know. the words to any. song for real that's so weird. when people do you know. i don't know any words. to any songs i only know some of them. it's always like i'd start off as hot. as [ __ ] you know like i'm good like it'll be like uh [ __ ] this is how we do it it's everyone knows that right. this is how we do it. it's friday night the feeling's right. and the party is here on the west side. and then what and i'm reaching i'm back. and i'm feeding my bodies. i'm in that event and i'm picks up. my cup and you know. a few and then i got best. stuff and you know this part. right because i'm faded and then that's it. ever since i was a lowercase. g and that's it. that's all you know dude. if you know any more than that. you know get a job i get why you guys listen. to this podcast man. you know sometimes it's uh off. the rails it feels it's a bit. off the rails but that's what's up. and i was talking to. rick glassman on t. and taking shoes off this week. and he was like doing a solo. podcast it's very very hard he's tried. to do it and he doesn't like it. he can't do it and uh you know. i think that we have something. in common because i think i can't. do it too and it is very hard. but i do it and i am so [ __ ] i'm gonna say something that annoying people say blessed. that you guys are here. listening to me man. um really really appreciate you. let's look at this thing. here what we got do we have. things up on this.
