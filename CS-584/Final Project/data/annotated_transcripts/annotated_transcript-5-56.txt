[ __ ] as a kid there was a girl that used to. babysit us jojo her. name was i didn't like the way. her mouth was you know. her mouth was like all like i don't know i don't no. i just decided i didn't like the way her mouth. was and she used this. cup once as when we were and and and and we had different. color cups like we had a [ __ ] purple. cup a clear cup a greenish. blue cup and a blue cup and a [ __ ] pink cup and a pink and then purple there were all like kind of like versions of each other and then they had a red there was a red cup and there were like seven or eight of them it'd probably. have an even number because it was a set. and that was like the cups. that we would use you. know and i remember those [ __ ] cups so vividly remember those. [ __ ] cups of vividly. that sounds like it to. park there for about like a privileged. one anyway so jojo. used the first time. we had the cups and judge' came. over she used the [ __ ] greenish blue cup okay and i decided that was gonna be her cup forever so whenever she came to. go babysit us i was gonna [ __ ] make sure if she wanted something to. drink she was gonna get the green. cup its greenish blue cup. so if she was like i'm thirsty. and even if she went to. go grab the pink cup i. would be like here use this. one instead even though they washed. the cup and i would tell my parents. i could talk about this. because ginger's definitely dead now. and even if she's not she's 90. and she doesn't listen. to podcast and even if she does she doesn't listen. to mine and and she [ __ ] she would she would use that cup and i would tell my parents i was like look my whenever my mom would give it finally i was like i don't want to. tell my parents that i don't want to. use the cup cuz my parents already thought. i was crazy because i have [ __ ] like crazy like i wanted him to. call me crazy legs like legit. legit ness i wanted to. call them to call me. i wanted my parents to. call me crazy legs dude. i asked my parents genuinely hey will you call me crazy. legs and they said no i said at least. at the dinner table and my dad. said no i named you [ __ ] chris you [ __ ] but i wanted that i think i talked about this on rogen i don't know but anyway so i was always like trying to. hide my craziness you know because i didn't want my parents. to think they had a [ __ ] crazy kid so my [ __ ] mom finally once supported the [ __ ] liquid that for me whatever it was you know water or soda or milk with the ice cube's clanking around here it comes in the [ __ ] greenish blue cup and i'm in my head i'm like that's jojo's cup i don't want her [ __ ] mouth to. touch something in my mouth. to touch something so now the [ __ ] cup comes by and i was like my i don't can you put it in a different cup. she says why and i said look. i don't want to. get into it. but that's jojo's cup and she's like what do you mean. and i said that's the cup. that jojo uses every time. she babysit come my mom didn't. know my mom didn't know because she wasn't around. when jojo was around. she was somewhere else just like i always look. i always make sure that that's jojo's cup and that's jojo's cup and i want to. use jojo's cup because you know i don't like her mouth. it's weird and it does. weird things and i don't want her [ __ ] germs on my journal i met in my mouth we wash the cups and i said yeah but it doesn't matter he said you know when you wash a cup in a dishwasher it gets it uses really hot water. and soap knows like yeah. but i did some germs. floating around she says it. all gets mixed up anyway. in the dishwasher i said i don't can. you give me the pink. cup or some [ __ ] and so she pour it out and put all right. we gotta use dude. you can't keep chris jojo's cup that. was always the joke. right can't give chris jojo's [ __ ] cup so then they'd give me the pink. cup or the purple. cup and nobody else cared. if they had the judges cup. and i was like i [ __ ] you know that's you yes your own [ __ ] fear your funeral and then and then and then [ __ ] sometimes they didn't know they didn't know they didn't respect it is the thing they didn't respect my way to. thinking cuz they knew i was being a peep. you know like all ridiculous. which i understand i was being ridiculous. and i'm not like that. now i would drink out. at any cup whatever but like they were trying. to get they would be like here's the cow. we don't here's the cup. that chris likes and it would they would give me. the [ __ ] blue blue green cup and but they thought that joe because the blue cup the bluegreen cup looked it was like very similar and to. be like don't give chris jojo's cup and they'd be like that's the blue. one i be like ma there's definitely [ __ ] blue and blue green jojo's cup was. the bluegreen cup i would imagine a [ __ ] nine year. old just like guys sit down jojo's cup is a bluegreen cup i don't want to. use george's cup because i don't like the way her mouth is and she puts i make sure every time she babysits i was like a little [ __ ] stalin and i never used [ __ ] jojo's cup i ever ever we got rid of those cups obviously we don't still have them because it's a [ __ ] century later you know what i wish right now i had [ __ ] judge oz cop i wish that was you know they say you know you become what you hate well that's i wish i had jojo's cup that will be my cup from now on i would conquer that [ __ ] oats ocd thought or that that [ __ ] thought and i'd make that cup my cup dude i feel like we all had [ __ ] like that as a little kid but i that [ __ ] got worse for me like i have crazy [ __ ] thoughts i remember one time we had this babysitter i can't remember her name she was french and she was like hot she was like a

about my childhood. it's crazy the way stuff shapes. you and all that you know. i think about that i do. i think about this the way. stuff shapes you and the way stuff shapes. people and how everything is nobody's fault. because of the way they were brought up. by the [ __ ] people that brought them up. basically whose fault it was. was the first two people they [ __ ] everything up they ruined bringing. up other people and then those people kept on running. and as time went on everyone. just got so [ __ ] up i mean kim jeonghoon who's in the guy. now we came jong hoon kim. jongil before him right. and before him who was it. it's gonna get worse. and worse because they keep [ __ ] up their offspring. you know we all [ __ ] each other up. and we all with tupac. said i'm the product of the environment. that rate that [ __ ] made me and he's right. he's right it's not somebody's fault. it's crazy right especially because some people's minds. are just [ __ ] broken i mean. they lock people up who do heroin. in jail you know. that's [ __ ] weird they got a real problem in there just gonna lock him. the [ __ ] up i don't know look i'm not saying i know what to. do i think i know a little bit about what. not to do just because purse. but like yeah people get so [ __ ] up and then they become 70 and there's no change in them. here's the deal i was at a coffee. shop two days ago and i was not paying attention there was somebody in front of me i was waiting for them now they were taking entirely too long and it's because there were a 70 year old woman. they wasn't 70 she was. probably 55 nah she probably 60. now she was taking entirely too. long and it wasn't because she was an old lady. it was because she was a an annoying. person that's why you knew when this woman was 25. she was still the kind of person. that took too long. it wasn't the kind of thing. where you're like old. lady yep she was just like it's like yeah. you're taking too long because you don't. give a [ __ ] about anybody else so she was taken too long. and i was told i was busy. i was what he called. it not paying attention. and i was facing the other way. and i turned around and i and i bumped her a little bit with my shoulder. i mean i didn't even bumper. i brush her it wasn't a bump. i wouldn't say it was a bump. it's like a seinfeld episode. was it a bump or a brush it. was a brush and i and i turned around. i said oh this. is exactly how i said i said i'm so sorry. i wasn't paying attention. and she looked and she just went like huh. you know so i stepped further away. from her i was about to. at least two feet from her. now now i was i was more than two. feet from her she kept looking back. 30 at least 30 seconds went by she kept kind of looking back as she was figuring out what to. get first of all it was taking too. long already and now she's taking way. too long and she kept looking. back me as i'm a [ __ ] is she looking back. at me it was very weird. and now i was paying attention. and 30 / 30 seconds. goes by and then she looks back. at me finally the last time. and she says could you please. not bump into me. again and i look at her. and i just start laughing. because like what the [ __ ] is wrong. with you lady first of all way. too much time went by. i stepped back over. two feet like what was i planning. 200 and then after the [ __ ] thing she was waiting for her oh god. she was waiting for her. drink just like and she was going. like this like rubbing it. like i [ __ ] beat her at and then she kept [ __ ] like looking at me and then like and then and then other and then and then i realized that she was a little bit like weird because she kept on like looking at other people talking them. for no reason but like either her mind is broken or she was raised. so wrong that ship is. [ __ ] up and it's not even her fault. but i wanted to. get mad at her i mean. obviously i didn't say anything. just gives a [ __ ] and i'm trying. to be as normal. as i can she was. but it was so weird. imagine how many [ __ ] weird jojo's cup story she has and her childhood. you know god i was reading. this book called come here and it was about the guy who ran american. university i think isn't like dc. or something i don't know but he was having all. sorts of like weird thoughts about like being attracted. to children and he didn't any and he was trying. to trace it back. why and it was because he realized that. like his mom and dad. molested him and yeah what was it. like yeah washington dc the book. is called to. come here i read. it and it's [ __ ] up a man. overcomes the tragic aftermath of what is it yeah of childhood. sexual abuse anyway he was starting. to like it's really really interesting. because the guy like like overcame it. and didn't molest anybody but like understood that he wanted. to he had those that inclination. and he got i think he got he resigned from that cuz he was he was like starting to. like i think email or something. college kids and he was just realizing it was inappropriate. and then just resigned and then wrote this book. richard burr ends and anyway it was. a good book and it was really. interesting i have no [ __ ] idea. why i read it. like what the [ __ ] but uh it was interesting. because that it was like that. it's like the cycle you know. but that's that's what it. is though like you think i'm not gonna have. [ __ ] kids that aren't weird that they have like i don't want to. use [ __ ] our babysitter's cup. and then i'm just gonna be like yeah i get it. [ __ ] for [ __ ] sake i told you my own cause two wallets. it runs on my [ __ ] family by. the way did i read. the [ __ ] email that my uncle sent me. on onair number one. i talking to ari. i gotta read this [ __ ] what what yeah. he sent me an email. no no no he didn't even. send me an email he sent. the [ __ ] podcast an email on my website he's got my number he's my uncle [ __ ] vinny oh god what is that vinny. i probably don't there we go. why can you never look. at the mail in the [ __ ] of course still searching and find there it. is oh wait no because it wasn't from him. it was from [ __ ] one fire dad i gotta find the [ __ ] i mean so far back he sent one fire sent me the [ __ ] email and he just wrote i mean and then let me see if i could find it cause it's really funny because this is all [ __ ] up my family is well you know what what what episode was that that we talked about it i guess we don't know huh i'm trying to. look at not gonna find this. for [ __ ] sake well you know what i'm gonna i'm gonna okay wallet if i just put wallet in the search thing it should show up right all right here we go got it. here it is all right. so one fire sent me this. this is two so all right. so for those of you that didn't listen. the episode which i'm probably. a lot of you did. but my oh this is why. this is why i'm so [ __ ] up cuz this is what my family. does okay so so my so i talked about how my uncle has two. wallets my uncle vinny has two. [ __ ] wallets he keeps ones in one and keeps other money. in there and i forgot. that he you know. i'm just gonna read the email. i was making fun of him. why he keeps two wallets. and how far could ridiculous. isn't ridiculous it is and how my family always makes fun. of him for it and then he always tries. to explain why all right. it was baldfaced a lot. barefaced lie that's what that was because he's all right. so here's here's oh and i talked to. you i talked also about the digestive drink. i refer to. is underberg about how like you overeat remember i was talking about that. you overeat and then you take the underberg and you feel better. anyway this is the focus on my uncle. i guess he listens to. the i know he listens to. some of the podcasts and i guess. he heard this one. or maybe somebody does it maybe somebody whom he knows. alerted him to. it because uh all right. so here we go. so he emails first of all the website the the podcast. website not me he has my number he doesn't call me doesn't text. me he he knows it's gonna go. to the [ __ ] one fire subject. first of all it's from his [ __ ] a law firm. email address email address alright subject to. wallets slash underberg that's the subject. okay message i respect [ __ ] lunatic. he is i respectfully submit that you are. a bold bald barefaced liar i. have two wallets. and two money clips. alright if you put all your money credit. cards health cards id. cards driver's license etc. in one wallet you are walking. around with a wallet. the size of the manhattan. phonebook alright with two what it's hard. to argue that yeah that it's true. is a lot of [ __ ] to. put in one wallet alright he's a really good arguing he's a [ __ ] lawyer okay with two wallets. evenly distributed in back. pockets i achieve buttock balance. and comfort as to. the two money clips. in parentheses in two different front pocket. front pockets just imagine we are. hanging out one day and one thing. leads to another and we wind up. at a strip i am prepared. with $1 bills you are not go. to strip clubs second. of all we're not gonna go when the strip club. valet in parentheses entitled to. its hip returns my car i have the singles. to tip him and you look like a cheap. alright next suppose we get mugged i give the mugger my singles. money clip and a wallet with she does. not know about my more valuable. money clip or my more valued wallet. i minimized my loss but you in parentheses one wallet. with all your money. credit cards etc. in it are left. penniless and there is a greater. likelihood that the muggers will beat the crap. out of you because you too stupid. to have two wallets. money clips or how does that make sense. and there's a greater likelihood. whatever furthermore the quote unquote. digestive drink you refer to. is called underberg it is. made from herbs and bitters and has been selling. worldwide for over a hundred fifty. years in parentheses that is before. you were born and i never said that. you should overeat and then take underberg so you can overeat some more i will admit. however that it's not a bad idea i will let you know. tomorrow so let this message serve as a formal. notice that you are to. immediately that you're to. immediately cease and desist from your unauthorized. slanderous comments about me and if you cannot do both then at least desist or cease whatever is easier love uncle vinnie oh i [ __ ] love my family man of course i forwarded this to. the rest of my family. and my dad [ __ ] email you back i'm crying. and i i assumed it. was because i assumed something. it was soon because he was crying. laughing but now that i think about it. it's probably because that has to. be his brother [ __ ] how do you grow up not crazy and i'm not saying i'm crazy. like obviously but like how do you grow up. not affected by that [ __ ] lunacy my family my parents. my uncle richard my uncle vinnie. my aunts man i was with them. yesterday some of my mom. my parrot minima and i put up. an instagram video of us. but all we do is talk. [ __ ] and laugh about it it's so far canned it feels so healthy man. i [ __ ] i'm real fortunate man and and i and i try not to. take it for granted. you know my dad's gonna be 70. in a few days and [music]. it's just uh it's just uh you know. i guess i suppose. that's where i was thinking. about my childhood lately. because i've been i've been thinking about all the times that. i've had with them and [ __ ] and like how great it is and how much like [ __ ] love is there man like like doing that [ __ ] like they they're packing up their [ __ ] and they're there they're moving and you know my dad would be annoying. his [ __ ] was just like you got to. help us pack before the [ __ ] movers. get here which is like what. the [ __ ] he getting the movers. for you know and i'm driving. down to the beach. just all [ __ ] it's so far and [ __ ] and i get there you know maybe in my 20s. i would have been like why. the [ __ ] do i have to. do this but i got there and i was just nice to. spend time with him and make fun. of him and be made fun of and [ __ ] show love that way. that's how we do it. and it was it was just i put up some video. of an instagram because i don't know i think my family's. relatable and [ __ ] i guess but they we had a good time we're just laughing and [ __ ] make fun of each other calling each other [ __ ] but yeah i don't know i you know that's why i was thinking about my childhood. and i i don't think i consciously. wanted to talk about it. on my podcast it wasn't in my notes. or anything but you know your parents. get older and you got a [ __ ] you know or not even just parents people get older and you got a yeah i don't want to. be one of those corny [ __ ] it's like cherish the time you have all your [ __ ] parents or people are on the earth and while your the earth but it's like who who cares my brother would say you're gonna die. anyway what's it matter but you know. it's it's it's cool to. think about [ __ ] that's a [ __ ] that's [ __ ] right that's all we have pictures and [ __ ] and memories that's so [ __ ] i forget so much [ __ ] people remind me [ __ ] i'm like really that happened and they're like yeah last tuesday's i got [ __ ] i wish. i remember that because that sounds awesome. did somebody take a [ __ ] snapchat of it. yeah mmhmm yeah i was i was in therapy. once for years just like you know. going because i thought it. was a good idea just to. keep mentally healthy and one thing. that my [ __ ] therapist said and i always think about this is you know she was talking about when her payment parents. died and she was talking about how it's the worst. thing you go through and the only good part. about it is and this is what [ __ ] me. up the only good part. about your parents dying is that you never have to. do it again you never have to. go through it again. and that's crazy there's so few things like that. hopefully cuz like look other things don't happen. to people like don't don't happen. to everybody like you know. people's some people's kids get murdered but it. doesn't happen to everybody. some people get [ __ ] raped that doesn't happen. to everybody of course it's great. that that doesn't ever have to. happen again if it happens. to you but but it still could you know. if you have more kids or [ __ ] you're in the wrong. area wrong time but your parents. never die twice. and that's the only [ __ ] thing that's good about that. that's [ __ ] crazy that's stuck. with me a lot and i [ __ ] think about that all the time i don't mean to. get all serious dude. but man that's gotta be the [ __ ] i don't know like i love my parents so much that's gonna be [ __ ] anyway i don't wanna think about that supposed to. be a comedy podcast. jesus christ you know. what though seriously you guys. got a [ __ ] we got it we got to. get through everything man it can't just be [ __ ] bam bam bam bam. bam comedy all the time. it you got to. take some dips. you got to [ __ ] him come with me dude. this is a cult you're not it. is not a podcast. this is a cult we're joking. we're laughing we're having a good. time and then we get [ __ ] we get real because not because we try to. or it's by design just because that's what happened. this is the ebb and the flow. of conversation and the and the cult. man when we're in the log cabin. later on i can't we can't there's gonna be times there's gonna be hard times there's gonna be times where people get you know don't get along. people get you know people are gonna die. people are gonna thrive and be happy. but people are also gonna hurt. their knee and then we got a [ __ ] aw.

[music] [music] yeah dude that [ __ ] song jesus. christ it's so funny the first time. i heard it i was [ __ ] laughing. so hard jesus christ. it makes me emotional a little bit. wider [ __ ] does that happen. [music] half for [ __ ] sake jesus. christ makes me want to. [ __ ] cry a little bit because it's true. you know there's [ __ ] yeah it's hard to. [ __ ] hmm b and it's hard to. not it's hard to. not uh not be cuda. you know i mean i know it's funny. and [ __ ] but it's [ __ ] true that song is pretty and he's just emotional about [ __ ] people being cudas i appreciate that man i was thinking too you know it was funny what else i remember from from going to. therapy was uh you know you're there for for therapy. and you're there to. help me to get your you. shouldn't have the person help. you and all that [ __ ] or whatever at least talk some [ __ ] out and i i me though you know and like i when i'm you know i make fun of [ __ ] and all that so i'd like sometimes give her [ __ ] and ask. her stuff like about her. even her life or the room. and [ __ ] and she never really you know talked too much. about it but there was this. stupid [ __ ] there were these figurines that were holding hands but they were individual. right like you could move them. however you wanted and they were holding each other's hands or touching. you know it was supposed. to be like and they were all from different. backgrounds like the people more some were darker. than others and some were [ __ ] swedish. and [ __ ] and you know they tried to. there were maybe like ten of them. and they were all set up. and one of them didn't have an arm right. like because it broke. not because it didn't and i said to. i was like why is that i was like there's not. an arm there what the [ __ ] happened is like is that supposed. to be like the disabled. one and she laughed and she was like nah. she's like it actually pisses me. off i said how come and she said well because when i moved into. this office i i dropped one. of them and the the arm. came off and so i would set that when i set. them up i set them. up but i put the arm down. next to the one. without the arm that broke off. and it was like that for a while. until one of my clients or patients. said hey that arm is. broken i noticed i i fixed. stuff like this all the time. i can i can take that. for you and i have the glue at home. and i can just put put it good. as new and it won't and it'll look normal. and so she so she said okay. and she took the [ __ ] thing back and when she came back the next week. for therapy she came back with the figurine without the arm and she said. i'm so so so sorry. but i i not only didn't fix it. i lost the arm i don't. know where it is and the therapist. was like oh well you know try to. make her not feel bad that's okay. i you know it's alright but it did upset. anyway she said to. me says and it always really upset. me because every time i look at it. i know i had the arm. and now i don't have it. and i probably have done it. myself and i just bums me. out that that's not there. because this these figurines she got like on a trip. somewhere years ago. that really meant something to. her and all that [ __ ] and i said yeah that's um that's true. you could you could be really upset. about that but also like that's i said something. like that's what's supposed to. happen like you know you got those [ __ ] figurines and you enjoyed them. as much as you could with the arm. and then you dropped it. and you lost and you thought somebody was gonna help. you and they [ __ ] lost the arm themselves. and they brought the arm. they brought the thing back. without the arm and now it. doesn't have an arm but that's what. was supposed to. happen and now you have the story about that. and you had the guy with the arm. for a long time and that was the time. that you were supposed to. have with that and that was the time. that was supposed to. you should you should you know. to be corny again. cherish the [ __ ] full figurine. set you were lucky to. have that for that amount. of time and now he doesn't have the arm. and it's kind of funny that that happened. that you brought the [ __ ] person back and it came back without the arm and now you have a story about it and and and that's what those figurines are to. you now the [ __ ] guy without the arm he's almost the most important. one now and she said yeah yeah you're uh you're actually right. you made me feel better. about that and and i said i wouldn't even want. that arm back if you had it. to put glue it because that's what that's what it. is now you know and she was like yeah. and i could tell i get it. like not that i made her feel better. but like i thought but she's like i didn't think of it. that way like you're right. you know and because like i don't know i was i was watching i was also in a good. during this guy's the doctor i think i was in the i was in episodes. as i was watching it. and the guy was paralyzed. and they were like we could fix it. and you can be unparallel. okay and then the wife didn't want. him to because she's like i love you. like this you know. and it's like a [ __ ] you know whatever happens happens and you roll with the punches. and [ __ ] and i guess that's why i was thinking about that therapist thing. because i was thinking about like you know. everything goes away anyway so you should [ __ ] be present i guess and enjoy the time he had in the memories and [ __ ] whatever i can't believe what i'm [ __ ] talking about but i do have these [ __ ] thoughts too i'm not just a lunatic and a [ __ ] and a piece of [ __ ] talking [ __ ] about everything but anyway i was with my family and i was helping them pack up and move so i guess that's why i'm in this [ __ ] kind of poignant thing but i'm glad you guys are listening and it's been a [ __ ] hour already that was kind of quick but [ __ ] that kudus song man so funny i mean he did there was one or two things that i didn't even remember that i didn't remember on those things let's take some quitter quest twitter questions though okay wow i thought you'd appreciate this stephanie foss says at miss foss the boss change it to. year old referred to. her coat pockets as snack. holes and this is what i shall. forever call them all right look if you're too you can call them. snack holes but don't that's not cute. if you're an adult and you're like hey [ __ ] yeah these are my snack. holes yeah you know what you get to. do you
