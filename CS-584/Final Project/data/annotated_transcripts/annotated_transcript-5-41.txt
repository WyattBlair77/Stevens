 when myspace was a thing. it was like facebook only it was myspace and it was basically the gangster. janky version of facebook. there was a thing called top. eight and you could have like your top. eight friends shown on your homepage so i made fake profiles for my top. eight and i made them all kurt. russell here's how you know. the kurt russell profiles were fake. if you clicked on any one of those profiles you would see each one. of those profiles only had one friend and they were me but one. time this guy wrote to. quoteunquote kurt russell from italy. he said i've seen. all of your movies i love your work. you're my favorite actor kurt russell i'm in italy. if there's anything i can do to. try and to. audition or be in your movie. i would love to. do it this and i don't use. this term lightly braindead italian. [ __ ] thinks that this is the real kurt russell hey then it starts to. dawn on me all of the things that actors and struggling artists. that move to. hollywood have to. sacrifice and give up and they give up. everything just to. hope to maybe get an audition for some [ __ ] kohl's commercial you know i'm talking about i'm getting mad at this. guy because if this guy oh i'm a huge fan. i always want to. be an actor if there's anything i can do if there's anything you could do move the [ __ ] la drop everything. and try you're not trying so i write back. as quoteunquote kurt russell you seem like it. got a good look and you know. if you really want to. audition for my next movie. about race cars why. don't you do the scene. from a few good men. where jack nicholson says you. can't handle the truth. and send it over to. me in a link and if it's good. i'll cast you in my next movie. about race cars i'm not. a bad guy for doing this. because if this guy actually thinks i'm serious and is actually kurt. russell saying hey man you audition for my race. car movie put on a [ __ ] monologue from a few good. men and he does it. then guess what his fault. he sends me an audition of him. doing the scene from a few. good men in his italian. accent i'm watching it crying. laughing rolling around on my on. my apartment floor the dude. had and i'm 95% sure was wearing sunglasses offscreen he's reading. the monologue the disrespect that. this [ __ ] guy has try and get a job in hollywood by hitting up kurt. russell on myspace and then [ __ ] reading it offscreen trying to.
