so i like the heat. and apparently a bunch of people are flocking. to uh what is it. desert valley what do. they call it death valley. death valley um because it's going. to be the highest temperature. in history for uh something like thousands. and thousands and thousands of years and tourists are going it's going. to be 135 in death. valley imagine going to. that on purpose don't do that. well that's what they're doing. i don't know i would think like you know. saudi arabia gets super death. valley is always breaking records. though man death valley. is the thing it is pretty where is. death valley like it's like close. it's close enough but not like super close. i think it's like i don't know. what it's north right. from here but it's in it's in california. dude it's crazy the hottest place. on earth is really close. to where we live we must be. really special me wow death. valley is in between yeah las vegas. and that is crazy that it. gets so hot there what's that all about 135. is nuts that's what they said. and tourists are going and some people are going. to die i mean. they deserve it well. no it's like going to. a war zone and being like i'm going. to experience it you know. it's not like going to. a war zone you know. it could be what if there's people shooting each other there. then it's a war zone. then well then it's a shoot. zone it's not necessarily a war. zone war is a lot. of shooting i believe i would whole lot. of shooting i would v i would venture to. guess that it's called death. valley for a reason. because they die. but not because they get shot because it's war. there no no i know but i'm saying it's also a risk. to go to death. valley yeah it's a risk. to go anywhere really i think kind of [ __ ] honestly because it's like death valley is like they're what else are they going to. call it they they got to. call it death valley they got. to call it death something. heat valley they could call. it h double hockey sticks valley. that would have been cool. hell valley hell. no h double hockey sticks valy. okay spelled out all right. that would be terri. d double hockey sticks that. is so dumb it's pretty. cool i like to. say welcome to. one hockey stick iine one. hockey stick ei line no. no one hockey stick. one hockey stick one. hockey stick i the other hockey. stick in yeah yeah okay. that's how you pronounce this. show my back hurts yes dude. oh dude where's your back. hurt uh wherever i go. what part of your back. uh the middle part that's always what. happens is it near your. spine yeah i mean all right. you know why you got to. be defensive about else no i just wanted to. know if we have the same. place where it hurts mine. is like up it's hard. up mine right here mine's. here no it's it's better. to be up here yeah. why just means i'm doing it. doing it better the higher. the better though really why. oh i'm sorry the lower the better. is what i mean why. well because then you got the rest of your body to. chill no i don't believe how about that. guy who came up to. us asked us to. take a picture of his license. i was in i was so confused. that i wasn't no you weren't. actually he asked me. i know and you he had a lot. of spittle in his. mouth it was disgusting. e i didn't even notice. that i'm very very i'm very observant. say what he did he goes. like this hey can you um oh actually you messed. up do you know. you messed up right yeah. i did but but i didn't okay. go go go what did he say first. can i ask you a question. can i ask you qu what. did he say well you you do. it i i kind of forget. can ask you a question and i was and i was like what's up. and he said explain. this long no that's not what happened. then you do it i don't remember what. he said first but oh he doesn't remember knows. what i'm saying because it was over. and then you said why. what's up and i go oh no. it wasn't over it was the beginning. he asked me can i ask. you a question and i said what's up. yes that's the only part i actually really remember it. didn't happen okay hello. it didn't happen okay. tell it the way you you. think it happened i don't remember what he said. first so i kind of who cares. just go the rest he goes. he goes momom whatever it was right. he did do that it. was a statement and then you say oh hey guys he oh no. no that's what he said. yes dude he goes like this. does this not work no. he said do you guys. work here that's what he said. dude no no wrong. wrong wrong wrong wrong he said. do you guys work here. the first thing he said matt. look at us we don't work. at a parking lot. that's why i was like this. guy's going to. try to rob us cuz we so obviously. don't work here so then even more so why. do you drag it out. i get robbed he said. do you work here i said no. and then what am i supped to. do why what do you need what. you said why what's up. that is the mess up. no i didn't do that. you did do that okay. well i regret it so i didn't happen. the things that i regret. they actually didn't happen wow. so it's all good anyway. he wanted to take a it. was so it made me mad. because it was so confusing. it wasn't it it it was he didn't expl. it right the reason. why it's confusing is because of how stupid the app. is that we didn't create it. was a lime scooter thing. that he wants to. get on and he was is like i don't have my license. but they want me to. take a picture of my license. but i i have a picture of my license. so can you take a picture. of my license on your phone. which is the wrong way. to say that he should have said the app only accepts pictures that. you take while you're in the app. not pictures from your library that. you can upload he didn't. say that all he said was i what. he said was i need a picture. of my license and i have a picture of my license. can i take can you use your phone. to take a picture of my picture. and i was like you have the thing. you're asking me to. take i go h. double hockey sticks no. right but anyway i did it. and i was like dude. it's not going to. work and he was trying. to scan a picture of his license. a picture of a picture of his license. from my phone which was so reflecting. and it was so bright. out yeah that i was like bro. it's not going to. work and he go he looks at me. he goes like this oh it's not and i'm like n. you got have the license. uh anyway that's trying to. touch your phone though and i literally i literally. got in like my knees. bent i was like there. something yes he was you kept going. like you don't remember he was trying. to touch it and you kept going. like this like a little further. no no no because he was too. close i was trying to. zoom pull it out that's why. i was trying to. pull it out because i'm like dude. you're not getting it right. he wasn't trying to. touch my phone he was trying. to steal something from us. dude no he wasn't i kept looking. around where's the pickpocket i i'm smart. i know i know i know know i i understand. i was aware that as well. but also it was fine. it was fine nothing happened. i listen to. a lot of dat line. we both don't have our. wallets you know realize it right. now wait a minute. wait a minute wait wait hold. on one second okay um i have a different haircut. he did my hair okay um all right. chris is back oh yeah. chris is back he was gone. for way too long 25. days yeah that's what i wanted. to talk about actually i wanted to. talk about the fact that he was gone. for too long days the thing. about going away is that it. can be great but if it's too. long it's worse what. do you think the most it's worse. than not going oh yeah. you know what i'm saying yeah. but he did it too long. so he shouldn't have gone. at all it was too. long for you or me. uh objective objectively yeah it. was so you you can't go. away for 25 days unless you're in rehab was it 25 days yeah that's so long dude. what were you thinking what were you. thinking over there i don't know. you were thinking huh. this is too long. yeah i was after a while by the end you were what's the what's the main. way to go in. how long away. uh 2 weeks is. the cap oh man. that's way too long. it's the cap it's that. is when it gets to. be infuriating after two weeks. it's infuriating i would never want. to go away from more than 10. days 10 days is i say 10. days is the cap ultimate after 10. you go i got to. get home after two full weeks. i'm infuriated yeah it was hard. it was not it was not easy. uh after a while and then i hit this. point where it actually felt. kind of good and and and different to. be away i don't even remember ever. being are you on the mic. yeah you uh you got bent. into submission by your by. your own vacation was like it. would had you in a i have the exact. amount of time you should go. away okay six days six days is good yeah. six days is good six swinger six days we're um all right. cool well that's it we figured it. out

[ __ ] great chris you look funky. um i have a a dilemma for you guys. um my dad has been attacked by a shark. twice in the same area. he keeps swimming um in the same. area the first time that he was attacked. uh rehabbing he would say that. it wasn't the shark's fault. he was just doing what. he was supposed to. do okay and he would go. back to the same. spot even after rehabil rehabilitating his his uh muscles. and doing all this stuff he'd go back. um and then he was attacked within two weeks of of being in that. spot again and um the second time. he went back after two. months and he was attacked again. same spot my god he he won't switch. up his swimming spot i'm trying. to get him to. do that he won't um me and my sisters. and my mom have told him. that even though the nature. of a shark is to. attack and eat and do what it's supposed. to do you still shouldn't put yourself. in that position in the same. spot we're trying to get him. to move down the beach. to a different spot. he won't do it. um hoping you guys will. uh like reiterate our point. and just tell him like no matter. how many times you go back. to the same spot. no matter how many times you rehab. the shark still going. to do what the shark. does and you need to. move your swimming spot. so please just help. me get this through to. him i would really appreciate it. yeah um i got you i love. you both chris you you and and the tmin aod and and uh everything. like that had a real moment. so much thank you guys. okay wait let me know what you think. so him him your dad. h the response of dad. you need to. stop going in there like you get attacked by a shark. and your dad's respon well. the shark just doing what. the shark is supposed. to do is the same. as this you say pretend. i'm the dad and you say yeah. uh yeah sharks is doing. what's wait no you say. you you got to. swim somewhere else like what he's saying. oh yeah you can't swim where you. you got to swim somewhere else. man sharks there sharks are usually uh blue. or gray it's the it's it's a non. respon that's not a [ __ ] response. right yeah what about about. do with anything yeah yeah sharks going. to do it char to. do mo i'm sorry. what's going on oops. what's going on why. do you keep playing [ __ ] music what are you doing i'm not trying to. no [ __ ] but you're doing it that's just as much as a nonresponsive [ __ ] dad who says shark. it doesn't even matter if i try to. explain it but what's happen. stop is what matters okay. what's happening is it. was on there and i locked the phone. and so then i opened the phone. to look something up and it's still on. you got nine computers. there wow look look at up. on a goddamn nine computers. turn the sounds down i can't. while it's still on the yeah. i get it i get it. it's like when i was when i was watching porn. and then i took my uh laptop over to. starbucks and i opened it up and it goes oh yeah. and ieper s deeper. you know whyer that used to. happen sometimes when i would start my car. what what are you laughing. at cuz i would start the car. like uh like lauren was in the car. you know bluetooth needs to. get better with that [ __ ] yeah don't do that don't pull up x videos on last thing. i was watching on safari. dude you know uh oh yeah yeah yeah it's always that. one too the flat. note oh yeah the swallow first god. so this guy's dad. uh answers questions with non aners and that should be highlighted next. time he says that stupid. answer stupid answer okay. yeah so don't let him. say that because that is a nonanswer uh it's good. i guess to. have some kind of sense. of exposure therapy but it's not. that he's scared he's not like i'm scared. i need to face my fears. and go back this. guy's like an idiot version. of captain ahab you know what i mean. he's i got to. go he's the guy who tries. to kill moby dick. and he always gets attacked by it but keeps going i know he's the main character. or not really the main character. but he's the captain of the ship. whale a character constantly trying. to kill mob dick. dude i don't and like ma mangled. him and ravaged his body but he keeps going back. cuz it's it's his you know it's my white. whale that's like what that. means no i don't know. what that never never heard you. lived in the world you ever. lived in the world you ever. lived in the world with people. my white whale dude. i like that yeah it's cool. that's really nice i'm glad it's like the elusive. thing that you always want yep. yep yep um well i there's that. ian edwards joke that's [ __ ] hilarious. you should look it. up whatever but where he's like you're going. into the shark's house. that' be like if somebody comes in your house and i don't know i'm ruining the joke it's hilarious look it up but but the he's funny he's very funny but uh yeah but um yeah it's just you you're you're this is the shark's place yep and you know this now because of twice this happened once maybe it could have been a mistake maybe or the shark like hey what's going on is that a seal i ah [ __ ] it freak but now the you know the shark's like get out of my [ __ ] place yeah it's basically like hey like if you're with a group of people and you're like let's go to. the park and throw the ball. around yeah uh and someone's like i don't i'd rather. not go to the park. let's go into. a guy's house and throw the ball around. like well you don't do that. because somebody's going to. get really mad at you because you're in their property. and they're going to. probably shoot you here's another thing. too if you let's go. to the park and throw the frisbee. around yeah but there's a lion. there you you wouldn't go to. that park you would go. to a different park. this guy think like to. drunk a park belongs to. us more than the ocean. and you're being like this about the ocean. yeah yeah so it's almost like i have a question. does he want to. die bro what's what's wrong. he might want to. die what's wrong with me. i keep i spilled i mean. you might as well keep going you know. yeah he might want to. die yeah people have a weird. thing like that like they're like people. have a weird thing with that. kind of stuff death you. know they they secretly want it. you know yeah the death. drive dude the death drive the death. drive is that something yeah is that something like the white whale. well it's similar but it's it's if it's if you're saying is it. like the white well in a sense. that someone long ago. wrote about it yes i never heard about the death. drive death drive it's like this. the sex drive but it's like uh you are born. and then you are immediately sort of the allure. of death is very strong. that you are seeking it. in indirect ways uh sometimes. not so indirect usually latent. ways okay you good yeah. i don't think i have that. i don't want to. die no but i mean. people i think people don't realize that. they the point is they it's it's latent. they don't realize that they have it. but they're just learning. the word lat trying. to so it's like a latency. period just learn the word laten it's like a latency situation. yeah yeah dude i mean. you know you have an intervention. with your dad you know have the shark. show up maybe slap your dad. in the face no cuz sometimes it. takes like a real shaken up. to really get a point. across also how about this. have you actually have you actually had a oneonone where you sat. with your dad or called. your dad and said hey it. really worries me i know it. this may be my thing. maybe but i'm going asking you don't swim there. please yeah have you done. that that could work that. should be the last line. of defense and if you haven't done. that you should do that. yes but i mean at a certain point. like he's just being such a titanic. [ __ ] this guy's people who love him he likes to. go swimming he won't change his swimming. place or swimming route whatever. the hell it's called. i hate when people tell me what. to do just like dude. a shark is eating. you yeah it's weird dude. that's shark eating you also. that's so annoying when somebody's like dude. i don't bro if if a shark. bites me i'm not adopting the [ __ ] thing. where people go like that's just what. sharks do and i can't be mad. at it nature does. what it does dude. i'm so pissed off. at that shark well. that's you know what because just as much as the shark's going. to do what it's going. to do is right. what should also be right. is that the person that the shark. bites wants to [ __ ] kill. the sh i'm going to. kill i'm going to. go i'm going to. kill it i want to. kill it that's what nature. kind of is dude these hero. type [ __ ] that are like you know what that's nature. i can't fault the shark. for being a shark [ __ ] that dude. i'm so pissed off. at that shark if it. bites me but that's what i'm. saying if a gazelle gets half. eaten by a lion. it's not just like well this. is what lions do mhm. continue you know what i'm saying. humans are the only ones that are like hey that's just nature. i want i want kill all. animals dude you know oh well that's a different. thing i think dogs cats. wow rabbits wow if the rabbits. were big we'd be [ __ ] you ever think about that. never one time in fact i'm not. even thinking about it now. that's how much i don't think about it. if uh if yorkis were big then that would be the greatest. thing in the world though. were like 10 feet. tall they would kill us. but they were the same. way that would be amazing. well then then they would smother. us and we wouldn't breathe. and they' crack our. bones when they sit on our laps yeah exactly. and that's where i was going. to go with that okay. cool go ahead next all right. hey guys lifelong fan. um me and my girlfriend. just moved into our new place. um i can decorate. the whole apartment except for the office. cuz that's her space okay. and she hasn't touched it um it's driving. me n and i don't know how to. deal with this what do you guys. recommend appreciate it bit. oppos bit opposite i want to. crazy cool cross are you doing. mad libs what what was that. last part he literally was bleeding. out and dying crazy cold. heart that was his final question. dude i that's opposite i don't give a [ __ ] about decorating and usually guys don't but this guy does and and the woman's it's the backwards. completely traditionally definitely the woman. has the office and she's only allowed. to decor or only wants. to or whatever it is. decorates that room even the office. part is usually i know. say everything about it. and and uh and she won't decorate. the office and he's decorating the rest. of the house that's hilarious. and he's like and you know. she won't shave her balls. anytime i ask her to. you're just like wait wait wait wait what. you know um but yeah sucks. she doesn't like my aprons that. i wear and my bra she. never compliments me with my tits. um so she watches porn all day. um so tell her yeah. that is driving you crazy. and that if she doesn't want to. do it i'm happy. to help that's the thing. like you want to. you want it to. be done up. decorated somehow not necessarily in your style because it's not your space. but it bo it. bothering you that there's nothing done. to that one room. in your new home is totally understandable. but what you should say. is hey how do you want. this room to. be i'll help you in fact. i'll do it for you. but just like all i need from you. is you to tell me. what you want yeah that's it. yeah just just she obviously doesn't care. if you haven't done that kind of how i am which i can. totally relate to i don't. really care but if someone was like hey someone i trusted and loved was like hey however. you want this room to. be like i'll do it. for you just tell me. what you want i would always be like oh okay. well maybe i want tell me how you want it. to be yeah you'd be like i want. dinosaurs up and [ __ ] cuz you yeah yeah yeah okay yeah dude cool uh that's a weird uh that's that's interesting. that he he cares. and she doesn't i mean that's not that. interesting i mean that's i should. i read a book. on that trilogy all. right um all right next. one okay so hi. guys hope you're doing well. um just a bit of context. before i reveal my problem um i've been married. to my beautiful wife for four. years uh but we've been together for 14. years uh we are high school. sweethearts so we grew a lot. together thankfully that's not the problem. why i'm sending this. in uh my problem is that anytime i go to. um foreign country for a trip like hiking or a festival. with a friend um and anytime she doesn't come with me. um i already feel homesick leading. up to the uh departure date. and i miss her even more throughout. the trips so cute. um i feel like these are tough emotions. to deal with and that's mainly the reason. why i'm sending this. in to ask for help. on how to. deal with these situations. um what i want to. add is that she's totally fine. with this and i don't want to. sound like i do this every two weeks. uh every year during summertime i go. to one festival like or or one. trip uh one hiking trip. with one of my buddies. so it's not like this. happens every week so yeah um i don't know. how to deal. with these emotions i hope it's not uh these are not the signs. of heavy codependence or um separation. anxiety but you decide i don't know i feel like i just love her. so much it's sometimes very tough to. uh be away from her. for extended periods of time. you know but i don't want to. drag this on too much. thank you for all you do. guys thanks i appreciate it. truly that you soon. by that guy loves metal. like death metal and that's our. guys who like death metal. or that's what they're like they're like know. says what does it say cemetery. or something gate creeper oh my god what is gate. creeper dude what is it about metal. shirts that they try to. make it so you can't. read it i don't know it's just it's just like the culture. of what what is that. anthony what is gate. creeper yes creeper gate. creeper yeah it's a band. what death metal it yeah. it's like death course okay. you know what it is yeah. uh okay well it's a romantic. comedy that [ __ ] ed burns is in it is uh so i think that i mean there's a few things going on creepers starring ed burs. you could be codependent. you could be just like it. could be like an anxiety. thing you know like your normal. routine is messed up and the person. that you do those routines. with is not there and you sort of get you. associate all that with this one. individual it could be a lot. of things but what i would suggest. is you say it's like once. a year you go. on this trip you know. and you're away from her. for however many days and it makes you feel not so great. i would say scatter throughout the year. like have like days not overnight. but like long stretches. where you are apart. so i think that like you can do. like a baby step because i would imagine that. if this is how you feel you guys. are together all the time. cu if you wasn't you would be used. to it i could i could identify. with this though man. especially that i get homesick before. i leave before i leave i get sad. that i'm leaving because i don't want to. leave my wife and my kids. get and [ __ ] and then as soon as i say okay see you right. it all goes away. do you know what i mean. i and then i start to. miss them again it's like it. resets and then i'm all right. i'll be okay cuz i'm worried. about what it's going. to be then when it happens. i'm like oh i don't have to. worry about this i actually know. how to be by myself. right and then as it's like it. resets to regular and then as the time. grows i i miss more. and more yeah but but that's not what happens. to you you're say you get you. mi you miss them immediately. and you miss them the whole. time before and during yeah it's i mean. definitely sounds like codependency to. me but i'm not a doctor but yeah um but also what you also. been together for so long. it's like i think that might be part. of it though you're you're so used this. is why i'm recommending what i was. recommending this guy is so you it's familiarity. even if it sucked. you might miss the person. because like there's this you the usual. thing it's it's like you're always with someone. and then when you're apart. you kind of feel like you're not whole and it. doesn't necessarily have anything to. do with codependency it can just have to. do with the fact that you're so used to. it that it feels like you're not doing. it right when someone is separate. from you and that's why i'm recommending. like try like if you have friends. that are not her try. like doing like little day. trips with them maybe more. often so you can get used. to this thing that it doesn't have. to be so overbearing i wonder. if it has anything to. do with the overnight. stuff too like i wonder if he's gone. all day if he feels. that way cuz if he's gone. all day and he feels. that way then it's definitely a real. actual problem i feel like gone. all day meaning he like if he leaves. at 6:00 a.m. before she wakes up. uhuh and then comes home while. she's either going to. sleep or after she sleeps if she's like man. today sucked cuz i didn't get to. see her right then you got to. work on yourself yeah you know maybe she's just so amazing. though she could be maybe she's so amazing. that like that's why he can't. bear to not be with her. she's just giving him sloppy toppy all day. giving him money all the time. yeah giving him back. massages and foot masses micro. machines okay well nobody wants those they're kind of cool. man they would he has a bothal. head it would be cool. to watch him go over. his bald head the micro machines yeah and remember if it doesn't say micr machines it's not the real thing remember that guy of course that guy everyone's like oh he talks fast. and it's like bust rhymes was like hold. my tongue well no dude. you know i saw an interview with him. once cuz i was kind of obsessed you know. like i get obsessed with like weird. ass you did mhm and. he's like i can actually i can actually oh lookie lookie lookie sorry. look lookie look weird. my is even on nish. okay go ahead um i forgot. the oh the mic maes guy. he he you saw the interview. it was like i can recite some some like book. or something yeah yeah or some song. and it was like a michael jackson song. and it was like 18. seconds he did it all in right. right right right right right. i remember i saw that. it was like bad or something. the song bad yep i can do thatw you know that's not fast. it's also not bad i know. it's that's uh billy jean. yeah dude you remember the [ __ ] david letterman thing. where he was like somebody. called in and they were like david. letterman does i always think i i want to. know what michael jackson says in the song. billy jean it sounds like he says but chair is not my but the chair is not my son. right and he was like i don't know let's listen. to it and they played it. and it was like but you know it. goes how it goes but the ch. is not my it goes. like this but that chair. is not my son like they just put somebody saying chair in it. ah all right next one. up matt chris f you. guys for a while but i'm gonna c. right to the chase. i have been on a few. dates with this girl recently. and things are going very very well i see. the potential for a longterm relationship. yeah and uh it's great. great uh all to. say though we're both in careers. where we might not be in the same. city uh within you know the next six to. 12 months i have my verion. of residency have to. go on next year that might take me out of houston where we're at now. i hope to stay. here but we'll see she similarly. she's in a travel position. where she you know. kind of moves every uh four to. six months wow jeez um she's open. to sticking around i get the impression. of we talked about it. a little bit but all to. say i want to. talk about it because i don't want to. you know this to. break off in a few months. i want i'm intentionally trying to. date and so is it something. i bring up to. her is it something i wait. and talk to her. about once things get a little more. serious and you must to. be greatly appreciated well don't you're you're he's. wanting to find a a lover. yeah well yeah so you got to. yeah don't yeah see if she's just doing this. for fun she might just look like the way. your mustache tickles her. on her puna he he he said he better. not lose it on her. uh he said that i'm i'm a little confused. he's saying what i took it. is he's he's he's asking what he should do. about wanting to. be a longer term thing. yeah because she moves. every six months and he does. too he might move in six. months as well he which makes the relationship. unstable so it's like he's like is if this is a real relationship. he really likes her. things are going well but what do. i do do i bring it. up to her because obviously we're both. not in a careerwise situation. to be locking down. some longterm [ __ ] i get the dilemma. but he was sounds like he's willing. to be long distance. for this girl yeah diie might be but what but then it's like but is she just like oh yeah. but i'm i'm here for four. months and like let's just get this. i think have the conversation. like super he doesn't want cal. and in a chill way. and then depending upon what she says approach it. like if she's like meeting you where you are. seemingly then you can just say right. then and there and have the convers then even though. it's pretty early in the in the relationship. but if he's solely interested. in if she's solely interested. in the then yeah or if she's just like for any reason. oops for any reason. she's not like absolutely it's. a possibility that i would stay. for the right relationship yeah then i think a little later on. you want to. be like look uh i know you said you weren't. that interested but like i am and if and if you think that's the problem. like maybe should end things now. yeah exactly right but have it. as casual as possible. at first don't make it seem like yeah. lean against the wall don't even make it seem like you are asking necessarily be make it seem like you're having a conversation. about it and you can volunteer. your feelings first uh because she will respond. in kind because she is a human. being and if she doesn't respond. in kind she has no social skills. and you don't want to. be with her anywaywe say listen. sweeted allll sweeted allll. why is the guy armenian. we like each other listen. sweet doll hey s doll. hey check this out hey come here. come here dog right. right right come here dog. okay uh yeah no i mean you know. you got it matt. right thank you mattch right. that was a really strong. full sam elliott style mustache. well the other guy wa this. is the mustache episode that long must uh that. yawn was too long. anyway next one it was as long. as it's going to. be what do you mean. how is that [ __ ] too long of be yawn. it was like four or five seconds. too long how long is it. yawn two two to. 3 seconds you like this. no i all right go. ahead hur my jaw wanted to. pretend like he wasn't recording. what's up boystim thanks for all. you do first of all just all around. good stuff always crack me. up mad i just want to. share my experience just wear a different. shirt you know for the soon. be motherinlaw is sick we did. the same thing for my fatherinlaw. best thing we ever did. sorry can you start over. started over i was distracted. for the he was able. hitler mustach and his tim. dylan persona he what's. up boys um thanks. for all you do first of all just all around. good stuff always crack me. up i just wanted to. share my experience uh for the guy. who's soon to. be motherinlaw is sick we did. the same thing for my fatherinlaw. oh best thing we ever. did still just so happy. that he was able. to be there uh about a year. and a half after he passed we had a giant. party oh right and everyone said it. was the most fun they've ever had because there was no. stress just food drinks. dancing laughing um or highly suggest it uh some people. were a little butt. hurt that we didn't invite them. but uh i mean that's none of their business. get over it so uh do what you guys. think is right i highly suggest it because uh you'll always have those. memories so thanks we were right. that's what we said right. what did we say. i don't remember the guy. yeah we said uh that. because his motherinlaw was sick she was. going to die. and we said have uh get married. at like either courthouse or just in front of her. so she can witness it and then after she passes. you have a a party mh that's what we said. that's what we said and that's what he did. and he said he couldn't he he highly recommends it yeah. so we were right without even knowing that. it was right we got last yeah. we were right and uh and the takeaway. is that is that we're really good at saying. things but um yeah sorry about that. you know it sounds like you did. it right and you got no. regrets and that's beautiful actually. he clearly he clearly feels. good about it man. takeing it from that guy he's gone. through it guy who's asked us. last week who's on the fence. maybe a little bit still from. what we suggested yeah well he actually was just like what do. i do right and i came up. with that i came up with that. idea solely just not even. having ill parents just figuring it out. on my own putting myself in the situation. of other people because that's what i you know. i can do that i mean. that's the almost the definition. of being empathy i'm an empath. an yeah yeah i'm an empath. human being i'm an empath. though okay no you're not i'm an empath. and when and when and then what happened. was in the beginning of life. i was an empath empath. and i got such i got you know. i got a little bit traumatized. and i kind of turned inward. and i wasn't an empath. anymore cuz i put up walls. right i put up a bunch of walls. and then what happened was i've been chipping. away at those walls for the past. like three four years and i realized you know what dude. i actually am an empath. it's just way way way in there. it's way way down there like the mummy. remember the [ __ ] movie with tom cruz how bad it was but how far he had to. go oh down in the ground. yeah he went down on the ground. did you see it yeah. i saw it yeah yeah he went. down on the ground. and uh that's where my empathy. is and i'm finding it slowly. but surely now i didn't make the i didn't mean. make this whole thing about me. you made the entire thing. about you but that's why. i switched it to. make it more about the mummy. about tom cruz cool. all right yeah who's up. baby that's good has no shir on what's up. matt and chris i got a question. for you guys has a tattoo of wood. on his right what are you supposed. to do in this situation. i was hanging out with people who were new to. the area and then they asked me. hey is there anything. fun to do around. here oh but i don't do anything. yeah that's funny all i do is riff and lift wow. what is riff so do i make stuff. up just lie do i do what. they should have done and google. fun things yeah right. it's stupid question anyway it. is a stupid question. every decently sized city is the same. yes are there any good bars around. here god bless this. guy probably yeah is that it. that was it that's hilarious. w he is right dude. and i often think about this i hate those questions. man cu i mean. what they're hoping for is these people are annoying. because they think like all right. every city's got their thing. what's their secret thing. what's the give me the i know. what the go i know what go. about this guy how about this guy the guy. that says i love to. travel but i don't like to. go to do what everybody. else i like to find the thing. that everybody who lives there likes. to do yeah yeah and you know. what it's just like this. yeah yeah okay well it's just like come. over and sit down at my house. for 5 hours then that's what we do. that's what we italians do we're not [ __ ] we're not looking at the michelangelo paintings all. day right they're not doing that. they're [ __ ] sitting smoking you know what i mean. hanging out with their friends seeing a girl go by and going hang out that's it. yelling at their children. if you're time clean it. up yeah yeah you exactly. yeah or crying because a show ended you know. what i mean like after every show. they cry or in italy. just crying because they're because yeah. because there's too much. emotion going on yeah um oh no. i guess i guess my car. is beautiful look at this. car like that say i don't. i don't know oh well that's great. matt so no they deserve to. be told i don't know. yeah to them. be like i don't know every place. is the same there's that cool. website let me google that for you. where you could send them. a link oh dude. let me send you a link. and then it sends you the link. you go to let me google. that for you dot com. and then they send you a link. and they click on the link. and it shows them how to. google what they ask which is funny. just send just send them google. dot com yeah that you can. do that too you know. yeah here you go. do do you know about the site. if you type in things that you're interested. in it'll actually come up. with a whole bunch of things. that you might do you know. what my you know what actually. this city has that's awesome. is this crazy [ __ ] website if you go on it tell you where to. go in the thing you want. to know what it's called. google yeah yeah right yeah 100%. but they want they don't want i don't want the things that google. i don't want the normally. what's the hidden spots. that kind of [ __ ] you know yeah it's annoying. as [ __ ] make up a spot that is like way outside really good in the or or in like a really bad part. of of the city like in a dark. alley somewhere but only go. at night you know. they're just like oh oh oh okay. yeah tell them there just speak easy and then just you know. watch on the news they get shot in the head. he you want you're going. to want to. go to chinatown and there's no chinatown in the city. that you're in be like you're going. to want to. find chinatown go to chinatown i gotta go. dude i gotta go. but go to chinatown and they go. they're just looking around. for chinatown yeah and they have a bad time. and that's what they deserve. yeah it is and and uh honestly. that's what you do probably even if you that's what. the locals do is look. for places and they get frustrated. and then you know when they're driving that's what the locals. do it's always frustrated to. drive so they're looking for something that's not there. the first road when they're driving. you're welcome remember it doesn't say. m all right cool yeah um um by another one. or what um have quick. question based off of your congratulations. podcast i was just listening had to. pause uh it has to. do with the woman uh in the chicken. place and uh just asking way. too many questions. taking way too long. not knowing what she wanted. um i am like you i am. prepped ready to go. i pride myself on how long time. it takes me to. order what i want it's not that complicated. it's food it's drinks. it is what it is you already. know what you like so that being said i am. with a uh my fiance who she is. that woman no matter where we go. uh i mean to. the point where i'm i'm like legit. prepping her uh i'm like you know. taking all off her questions. before i'm say ask me. because i i know the answer. it's not that complicated. you know what i mean. it's uh it's food it's drinks. doing your part and i think it's almost like a tick like she she needs. to ask a question. every single time uh no matter where we are no. matter where we go. it could be the simplest of things. and yet every single time. doesn't matter how big the line. is she never looks behind. her it's it's just focused. on asking uh unnecessary. questions and she i think loves doing it. and it infuriates me and um you know. like i said i prep. her beforehand and doesn't matter i wonder. what the invol so i don't know. i don't know what it is. uh my question is what can i do. other than what already doing. which is yeah i'm playing defense. for the people who are working there. and then the whole time. i'm kind of giving them. like that you know. apologetic look and then i'm looking behind me. guy i don't necessar i try. not to look behind me. because i know have that watch because if i was just like you if i was back. there and i'm looking forward. i'm like you don't need to. be asking these questions you know what i mean. so um anyways advice please. anything because it is one. of those ongoing um internal struggles. i guess and perhaps i'm projecting i don't know. but um anyways uh chris i am living. in sweden been here the last 5. years when you going to. do an international tour. that would be delightful i just saw living the life. not too long ago. so too bad got dud. so uh and you're up there. so it

[ __ ] beef salad fish. and you got very very good. one like a [ __ ] [ __ ] all right okay so i think that i hate people who do this yeah yeah it's just it's irresponsible and it's okay you she to. be a lovely wife and everything. it's just like that's her. thing it's like it's like yo yo sweet. do here's the thing if you're in line. here's the biggest offense. when you're in line. waiting to go up. in order and you get there. and then you have a bunch of questions. it's like figure it out. before yeah figure it out before. that's why it's good. that she has him he's doing the work. he say it doesn't matter. i know but but i'm saying all he can do. is control what he does. so good on you bro. but we need to. get deeper so i think you need to. like sit her down and be like look why. are you doing this. oh it's going to. be so awful for him. but like not in like an accusatory way. no i know you got to. emphasize i'm not accusing. you of anything i'm i'm i'm asking this. from the bottom of my heart. i'm curious why do you do this. because maybe the reason i'm asking that is because maybe we can figure out a reason. or a system that means you don't. that fixes it makes you. not do it right. you know because and then she'll be like well what's the big. deal it just annoys you oh well boohoo that's how i am yeah. but it's inconsiderate for. other people that's what i was going. to say before you cut me. off also can then say when we're online. though and we're holding up a line. like it has nothing to. do with me yeah uh so yeah. well so kristen doesn't ask questions. but dude when you sit down. and the menu's there you figure it out. right cuz cuz when the when the waiter she'll kristen. will be like actually i haven't even looked at. the menu yet. and i go very very bad. one pound fish that's not right. dude get it know what you want. it's like the people who order. d there's rules there's rules. you go and you [ __ ] you don't sit down. go to the bathroom. before the waiter comes you. order first and then go to. the bathroom agree agree. yeah do we know. this agree agree it's crazy. people sit down and they're hanging out talking for. a little bit they go. to the bathroom and then the waiter. comes oh hi can i get drink. orders oh i'm in the bathroom. can we order food. i don't know she's taking a [ __ ] right you know right. okay graphic but yeah she's taking a [ __ ] plopper. dude great dude she's in the you know what my wife's. in the in the bathroom taking a plopper. taking a one pound plopper. good one pound one pound plopper. one pound plopper. dude come on ladies one. pound plopper that's my nickname. one that could be a good name. for the episode one pound plopper. i thought that but i didn't want. to say it live but i thought it before. you no we good no. we're not good cuz i thought about that. we good the biggest [ __ ] of all time. is to do that. and we good to. do that after having sex. with someone for the first time. would be amazing and we good [ __ ] dude especially if you were two gay guys wow very very good one pound floer yeah uh all right so yeah you gotta i you know what though i got to. say i think this might be the first submission. that i don't know what to. i guess i did give advice. but i don't know if that's going. to work dude this is a problem. you might not be able to. get to the bottom of culture. b the culture talk about the thing where uh you say people use this as like oh this is my time. i get to order. now nobody's going to. [ __ ] with my time talk about how you talk about me. to talk about that yeah. because there something you you told you told me. about yeah people like when they get there's like a whole mentality. of a certain kind of customer and it's not. just about food yep. it's about anything that. it it's very american. thing but i'm sure it's also true. in other places but it's like people think that they're the customer so that when it's their moment. to be asking questions. to be considerating considering buying something or considerating uh or considerating yeah. uh it's like they not only are allowed. to take all the time. that they want but it's their absolute right. birth right and everyone else doesn't get to. say anything about it because when it's their turn they will never say. anything to them it's like they have a wrong. way of thinking about it. but but it is somewhat. common that people think this way. it's like a very much customer is. always right mentality it's very. corporate mentality in general. but here's the thing and let me tell you i've never felt something. more strongly and emphatically than this. the customer is not always right no. in fact the customer is more often than not. mostly wrong really wrong right. and if you lived by that. if you actually lived your life. by that rule the customer is always right. nothing would ever get done. every company would go bankrupt and nobody would be happy. in the whole [ __ ] world i want to. have a store that says the customers only right. sometimes on the window come. in at your own risk. right yeah yep at your own. peril quicker your i'm at the thing. i'm at the the what do. they call the people who take the orders not. the waiters but the people behind the counter. or cashier quicker yeah. cashier quicker it's right all that's right. there six things quicker they're all the same. thing really one's fried. quicker right quicker yeah. quicker why are you saying quicker. because they're taking too long. they go oh oh i see do. i want the burger or the or the burger. with two patties you could do that. i mean yeah if your place. was popular enough you could do. anything like that you know. cuz you keep people out and they be like oh my god. i got kicked out a so and so resturant i just wanted to. have it it's like the no. soup no soup soup. no soup for you. that funny classic episode. would you say that's the number. one classic episode of seinfeld. okay i've gotten into. this conversation before i you. have yeah i i thought so okay. but i think real seinfeld. heads would tell me otherwise. yeah there's a lot. i'm not one but i i love. the show i haven't seen every but i love the show. yeah but i think that we talked about that. a lot probably maybe yeah maybe like dad. or mom thought it was funny. or something but i have some friends. who fully have seen every episode. more than once and they're like i mean. god there's so many funny. episodes the keith hernandez episode. is hilarious no dude the [ __ ] episode where he oh [ __ ] where he where george has to. go pitch the thing and he has to. go good night everybody. like leave his confidence do you know that. one yeah yeah dude the funniest. is it twix what's the company. so the funniest character on seinfeld. is not open for debate. not even close the other people on the show. are funny they're very funny. but everybody's show oh it's noor cen there's no question. and let me tell you something. else people have different opinions they'll say jerry's. the funniest they'll say ela's. the funniest but if someone says kramer's the funniest that. person is not funny the person. who said that is not funny. i i i'd say on a rare. occasion they could be funny but man they don't really actually get they don't get do they it's like some guy walking in the door looking like he got electrocuted like and kramer is very fun course everyone of that show's hilarious i'm not george castanza
