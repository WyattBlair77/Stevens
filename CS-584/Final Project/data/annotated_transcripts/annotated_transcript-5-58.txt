couldn't do anything. i canceled everything i've got some auditions now. your boy auditions sometimes no. i don't like to. because here's the thing uhhuh. hollywood is weird how it is. all right it's like guys. way above me are auditioning like he if i hears. like i do get offers. to do stuff. like but it's usually comedy. right but like if i have to. like if they're like oh yeah they're interested. in you playing a doctor on [ __ ] you know abc. or or they'll be like well let's let's read. them because you know we don't know. if he can say succinylcholine and and not have it. be it'll [ __ ] laugh out loud hilarious. right which is whatever but so i understand. that but dude there's the way. hollywood does it is hundreds of people. will audition for these parts. and it's just so [ __ ] ridiculous because they should just pick they should just pick should just pick they got movies. that are coming out that are like comedies that are like that. like everyone's auditioning for that you'd be like what what they why. are they auditioning and it's like you can just you just know. if you have any sort of vision at all. and you're a director just pick the [ __ ] guy you want to. be what's his name. um who's the guy that looked exactly. like me in the [ __ ] new abc show. that bobby lee's on hudson oliver hudson you know. what he does okay. if you want him to. be in a movie have him. be in the [ __ ] movie don't call the guy in the right. now that guy probably does get offers. so i'm this is wrong. but like there's so many guys like at that level. that it's like you know. what the [ __ ] guy does uh like bobby but you know what bobby leaves. a great [ __ ] example actually how you gonna make bobby lee [ __ ] audition for a movie bobby lee's been around for 75 years and he and you know what he does especially in a comedy he should never have to. test for any show. ever if you have any sort of vision at all. you can see oh i want. bobby lee for that part but bobby lee has to. [ __ ] an audition every now and then and that's so annoying for bobby lee and you you're wasting time. you know he can [ __ ] do it bobby lee's. [ __ ] hilarious um but it's it's it's just like all these [ __ ] hoops that you have to. jump through as an actor i'm auditioning for for two things later and you know and and here's the other thing too dude. getting the [ __ ] sides sides are things that you are the are the part the few pages that you read for the audition right. so it'll be like eight. pages of sides some of these [ __ ] tv shows will be like hey here are the sides and it'll be like 12 pages hey dude [ __ ] my ass are you that's half the script sometimes twelve pages you [ __ ] [ __ ] dude make it five at the most okay if you can't see what i do in five pages you got a bad script okay like [ __ ] and then and then and then and then dude even better even better dude some of these [ __ ] movies will be like yeah my agents assistant will hit me up and be like oh you yeah they they're the casting is sending you a link they're emailing you a link directly to download the sides because they won't send them through me because they don't want they want it to be you know what do you call it harder to get like exclusive or like i don't know i can't look at the right word but like it's a private and they don't want it to get out there you know and and and you're like okay and you wait for the email from casting and you'll get some [ __ ] email from like dink donk zip and you're like and you look at it and it's like oh down oh you got to go to ember shot to download to download the thing so you'll click on the link and it's like ember shot calm and then go to ember shot and then it'll be like ah do you want to open the ember shot app and you're like what and then you click it and it'll be like do you want to download the app and you're like no give me the [ __ ] sides and then and then you but and then you get hit back to the agent assistant and you're like hey it says i got to log in and they're like oh really hold on and then they'll send it back to the person and they'll be the person in the production office and they'll be like oh ok you got to create a login and i'm like nah and then so the asian assistant will do it it'll be like i created a login for you it's [ __ ] you know and it's always something like you know chris 70 and so i'll put in chris 70 and it it never works the first time so then i gotta go back yeah it's not working and then they stated. like oh it should work. and then i tried a second. time and it works and it's not. my fault and i know. it's like well i worked the first time. it nah some of these [ __ ] logins dude. they're made so they don't work. the first time i swear to. [ __ ] god dude and then you'll get it and then it'll be like oh it'll be too small it'll be too [ __ ] small and then you so you got to. get the app so now i'm downloading the [ __ ] ember shot app and i get it and and and i and i look and and now it's like printed. yeah and and it's for like and and you'd think this. is for [ __ ] star wars. and it's for some [ __ ] like in the army. now reboot and you're like who the [ __ ] gives a [ __ ] this much about in the army. now reboot who gives a flying. [ __ ] these production companies think that these move nobody gives a [ __ ] about your goddamn movie if it was in a movie yet if it's not number 4 oh yeah we don't decides to. get out because we're worried about the the the blogosphere. getting the [ __ ] nobody gives a [ __ ] and i got to. do [ __ ] all this [ __ ] and then i got to. read five pages and then i got a it's some [ __ ] it's so dumb dude the whole thing so dumb you know that [ __ ] bobby lee can play taxi driver in a [ __ ] movie with paul rudd you nut i mean you know well it's so ridiculous the way they do it anyway mmhmm so i got to. do two of those later. and therefore [ __ ] that i think are good. cuz otherwise i just i'm like no. no no no no i i fight. my agents i don't fight. them but i'm like i'm not going. out on that what do they want me. no they want me. to read for it. and i'm not going out no. you know why dude. you know why you know. why because people don't know this. but if you have any sort of a fanbase as a comedian. you're making way more money. on the road people think like oh people in tv. are all rich if your show. goes for [ __ ] six seasons yeah you're [ __ ] sitting pretty but if you're like on like different shows that come out sometimes and you know you did like sick you show got six episodes and you did a season of a show here you're you're [ __ ] broke and you're trying to. make you got to. take the next job you're like oh where's the [ __ ] job coming dude and then so they're like oh yeah let's have chris d'elia or [ __ ] reefer dude no you know what i'll go to. cleveland or [ __ ] whatever and make more money doing a literally exactly what i want. to do rather than having to. play some [ __ ] guy in some paintbynumbers network show i mean. some of these

you cuz you got once. for some jokey reason [music]. yeah yeah dude this guy like what. would threaten somebody you know what i was uh my favorite thing. my you don't comment i get sometimes. i get this comment like a bunch on my instagram. cuz i know i like i'm a comedian. and i know my posts i do cuz i think they're funny. you know and because i'm i'm a professional comedian. i've got whether you like it. or not i've got a pretty good. handle on what's funny. it's my profession i obsess about. it not just through. my adult life my whole life. that's why i became a comedian. people comment sometimes wait i wrote down. what they come in i don't. understand how anyone could find this. funny like they'll write like i don't. even get why anybody would find this. funny this is so stupid. how could anybody find. this funny i don't understand. how anybody could find this. funny and talk about slams you're slamming yourself. you know the reason let's do a little bit of walking. forward for you since. you're not doing it yourself. you know the reason why you don't understand. why anybody could find this. funny is because you have a bad. sense of humor that's. why you slammed yourself. so let me just push you out. the door a little bit cuz you're already. almost out there good gunk. dude i don't understand. how anybody can find this. funny in the meantime. everybody ha ha ha ha so funny and me [ __ ] literally bought real estate or real. estate off of [ __ ] off of comedy. you don't get why anybody could think. that this is funny when it comes down. brass tacks it's cuz you have a bad. sense of humor that's. why plain mm simp. that's the only reason it could be that's the only reason. it could be it's literally like saying. whoever hits a home run. in baseball and you're like i don't understand. how anyone could say that's a homerun. those are the rules. i mean the comedian. if i put out a joke. in professional space that's funny. you i get it sometimes. jokes amiss but like you know. if you're just some person that like doesn't have. anything to do with comedy. let's just go with i'm right. people comment this [ __ ] all day long i don't get not even just on me. i see it our house. is on me this. is funny you can have your opinion. but like the reason why you don't get it. because you have a bad sense. here it's like north carolina. and south carolina moving mississippi. and mississippi in the jigna any more. than a minute in sacramento. that's what's like you know. that's all it's like let me. see if i have the ig [ __ ] i hate when people call it graham
