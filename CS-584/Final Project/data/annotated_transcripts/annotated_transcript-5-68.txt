happened and she said well. you stop i asked you. to say i and you stop and you said hi. and then you just left and i was like all right. so now put yourself in the shoes. of a dlist celebrity like myself. okay someone asks you you don't know. while they're walking fast i might add saqqaq. to say i might add but hey can i say hi. to you and then you stop oh hi. and then they say hi. and then there's a beat and you don't know. what to do you made this. situation awkward by stopping somebody and saying. can i say hi to. you which is fine. i did that then it was on. you to talk hey it's still your turn. hi hi okay you go she. didn't she then i was like okay. and she said oh that's it. huh hey girl this. is earth and now i'm the rude. guy the [ __ ] was i supposed. to do give her a massage. she that's not right it's not right. and i stand for all. the dlist celebrities plus cb and alist celebrities i'm sure it. happens too even way. more but it's like people think you're rude. i've had people be like you you were so rude. when you took a picture with me i took the goddamn picture with you well what am i supposed to. do stroke you off. am i supposed to. make you a ham. sandwich plus if you're a fan. of mine you know my [ __ ] attitude it's all love baby it's all love but you go and waste my time dude you gonna make me feel awkward i'm parachuting the [ __ ] out of this plane dude lady was nice she was a sweet she was her friends were sweethearts they came up too we had a whole. conversation and they were sweet. you know i'm really not a rude. person but sometimes i come off that way. because i don't know what to. do hmm can i say how do you yeah sure hey oh cool heyoh. bring a combo bring a conversation. man otherwise what are we doing here. yeah but describing someone is nice but it just like mmm i don't know. san jose babies came out it. was fun man had a good time. perform at the san jose i'm for a really. great staff management they're really. great and then mmhmm what else happened. this week it's been nine. days since i've done. a podcast man carefully we've been doing. this podcast for about a year. now [music] yeah pretty wild. actually how about these [ __ ] christmas songs you know what i don't. what i don't mind christmas. songs i don't mind. i don't [ __ ] mind i got a buddy and he's like you know chris paul he's always like oh they started the [ __ ] christmas. songs everyone everyone everyone every year. goes like this oh man. they keep starting to. christmas songs early and earlier. earlier and earlier hey dude you know what no. they don't they start them. over in [ __ ] november always everyone says it every year if everyone said it if that were true they'd be starting in [ __ ] august they'd be [ __ ] have yourself a merry little christmas. in [ __ ] april eventually oh every year it's early an earlier just hear those sleigh bells ringing ding ding jingling. how [ __ ] you our christmas. songs they don't even write. them their sole accent is. it lacks a basic. allure lack of days ago [ __ ] that word its lack of they lack some days ago jazz hear those sleigh bells ringing lin jing jing jingling i can't even think about it well let's sort of record another one really yeah cool yeah let's record another one even write it nope oh jingle bells jingle bells jingle all the way jingle. farken jingle alright we'll put it on wax. yourself a merry little. christmas sebacic may your days be brah eat spacek. its lackadaisical why do people. say laksa days ago. i knew it was lack of days. ago i [ __ ] knew was lackadaisical and somebody years ago. told me was laksa. days ago they made me feel stupid. the whole party was like you [ __ ] idiot it's [ __ ] lackadaisical goddamn i don't remember who those people were but [ __ ] you just hear those sleigh bells ringing ding ding jingling such a [ __ ] you just like like you know just hear those sleigh bells first of all ringel in and then jing jing jingling so shitty i'm so disrespectful what's the one keep it what's the song that goes keep his spirits spirit with you just what's it keep there was one song song i was saying earlier together. about the spirits and it was like i wanted. to talk about it later. cuz it was so [ __ ] you a camera what it is every song every christmas. song has spirit in it. silent night holy night. always imagine that song as like they they're like when they're singing. they're literally like oh we gotta keep coming. up with lyrics i can't. cuz i gotta i'm nasally but mmm god everybody. has their own oh that everyone has. iii it just bothers me how every singer. has to come out. with their own rendition of a [ __ ] sing a christmas. song you know what i mean. laughing through the snow on a onehorse. open sleigh over the fields we go. laughing all the way ha ha. ha ha i mean nothing nah. does now how goes do. it taking some many liberties. first of all or hey dude put all and i know i'm the last person. to say this because this podcast has its own. language but put all the goddamn letters in the [ __ ] song. it's kind of this [ __ ] though. you got to admit. over the fields we go. laughing all the way but i like when they do or the fields we go. laughing all the way ha ha. ha that's how it should be i don't like when they [ __ ] every you'll get like harry connick jr. you know laughing all the way ha ha. ha ha you know what i mean don't [ __ ] make it your own dude. shell son bobcats. when i hang and i'm making spirits bright. oh i'll put all the [ __ ] letters or the yields we owe. a thing all the way. do it like that do it. like that i'll have so much. more respect for you it. king eretz i ate an orzo into. a or that yields week. all that to me. is this [ __ ] didn't make that song laughing. all the way up see dasyam. didn't demand aha if they did that'd be. my favorite christmas song. of all time don't just use. our because that's the thing that bothers me. don't just use the one. or if you're gonna do more contributed. the contractions make the song. that way don't [ __ ] slip in a contraction like acute all of a sudden [ __ ] you know michael buble some singer. michael buble he gets a pass. cuz he basically just sings. christmas songs all year long no matter. what he's releasing you. know like put on any michael buble. song during first message you know you won't even know that. you'd be like i was this. is just a regular mike. couple a song i mean this. is just a christmas. song anyway how about dmx is rudolph the red. nosed reindeer song
