at. california whatever la is not equipped for the storm and it's okay. there was mild wind now. let me ask let me actually. talk about this dude. they do category one two three four. five right it only means the wind that. doesn't account for rainfall now. what the heck i'm not a barometerist but it's like dude. account for the water. you know come on man. account for the water. the water is the thing. that makes the flights have more people die. from the water than they do. from the wind i mean come on. dude that's either true. or i made it up. but it's like come on dude. you see all these floods and all this. stuff and remember when fort myers. had that crazy one the whole city. was underwater jeez it's just like and i just learned. that but fort myers. was all under what i'll be. in fort myers also chrisley dot com. coming up soon here. but dude it's just like make it screw this. wind stuff it's really about the rain. man uh so come on the government. clean it up come on botanists. or whatever not botanist barometers. or you know weathered people. i like how weathermen can be like fours. and fives but if you're a a woman. a female weather woman whether female you

[laughter] oh man so uh i mean. everything i say on this. podcast and that's why it's not a comedy. podcast that's why it's an absolute drama. i have the only drama podcast. and i don't i know there's storytelling like the whole thing. with um and there he was found himself. stark naked in the middle. of a field holding a decapitated head. i know they have those story like they tell real. stuff and they do like stories like the i saw this. i listened to. this podcast uh the girl in the blue. mustang or something where they arrested. the wrong guy and then he got out. and the family still thinks he did. it and it's like but this podcast. is a drama um and it's the only one where a guy. just straight up talks to. you and it's a drama so anyway. whatever dude it's like go. go to other guys for your comedy.

tacs. and ooh dude oh kind bars by. the way if you've ever eaten. a kind bar and you like it. that's the enemy right there. kind bars are so bad. dude kind bars every single kind bar. are [ __ ] absolute trash. every co and the name kind dude. i'll do a soft kick to. it i'll tell you what man. kind bars dude eat the blueberry. one it's worse than the chocolate. one it's worse than the walnut. one it's worse than the [ __ ] um almond dude. they're all bad and they stick. to your teeth dude. they're so what are kind bars. who are they for that's the enemy. you see someone eating a kind bar. that's i swear to. god that's the enemy i'm i'm telling you dude. you can't trust somebody who likes. a kind bar because they think they're eating. it for [ __ ] because they think it's good for you a little bit they think it's a better. version a more healthier. version than the stickers even though. it's not you know an arena. kind bar and they they don't know really what's going. on you can't trust a [ __ ] that eats a kind bar. because they're just sitting there. thinking they're doing something you know. like they've been somewhere god like they never traveled. but to tell you about the [ __ ] stonehenge that's the kind of guy who kind bars well. i've never been but you know the reason. why that is that is a kind bar. either if i've ever heard it and they got kind bars that [ __ ] home depot i don't like how every store also sells water. you know every single store. sells water every store you go. in and you can also get water. it doesn't matter what it's you. go to home depot get water. bottles of water and then in 1970. bottles of water weren't even a [ __ ] thing and that's either true or i made it up but then bottles of water. [ __ ] happened and now you would be like remember what the [ __ ] about i remember when i was young about his water. or something with a bottle of water. what a [ __ ] prissy [ __ ] you just drink out. of the sink and yeah but it has lead in it. and you're like does it. okay i'll get a bottle of water. and he realized it's not that. bad sometimes the sink water. is better than the [ __ ] dasani [ __ ] dasani tastes like a [ __ ] someone it's somebody's leftover colonic [ __ ] yeah and uh so now they just sell you know water. just everywhere go to. a vape shop hey dude you got it they got it. yeah we got the right. there in the in the fridge. you're a vape shop. dude you know you sell terrible. [ __ ] don't act also like oh yeah you may need a water. i swear to. god i went to. a place i went to. [ __ ] lids they were like dude if you need they had a powerade water. [ __ ] fridge at lids. every place has one and then now bro. i was saying this to. my brother and my brother. goes like this dude what about water. shops and i go. like this what he's like yeah. there are places that you can that. just sell water and i said well no there's not and he said yes there are and i go. link me to there's. places you can just buy water. probably run by the russian mafia. i swear to. god there's places you can just go. buy water dude imagine shopping there. just like what a piece. of [ __ ] you know oh let me get the um the ph. do you have a p. i don't know i remember one. time i was [ __ ] whitney comics was trying to. tell me about the water. and how you gotta have this because it's got the ph. and i'm just like oh yeah. didn't do [ __ ] kept drinking that [ __ ] whatever i was drinking. you got to be wary about people. who eat kind bars and talk. about water too much. for real as i sip on my [ __ ] arrowhead people think it's pond water i don't give a [ __ ] dude oh there's tadpoles in my belly. so anyway dude um i drink water. and i drink uh coffee and i drink uh club soda. and that's [ __ ] the most interesting thing i've ever said so go eat my dick.

thought. but i still did [ __ ] crack. them dude that's great he was crying. over spilled milk you know. um bro wait wait wait. actually let's look up. this thing this is hilarious. that that bradley cooper they can't. stop doing it i i don't know. i don't know i don't know about this. [ __ ] where because people that you had the junos on or whatever the [ __ ] the big big nose and then they look at this look at this well so now they're coming out with daughter. who's like why bradley cooper's fake nose may. not be an antisemitic. scandal critics claim did this. the best because the dude. had a big ass honker. and yay happened to. be jewish a lot. they made it bigger than it. actually is though didn't they they got a side. by side here the guy had a nice. nose and they rather coopers playing the jewish. guy and they they beefed up. his nose look at this. hollywood cast look look at this. dude these stop antisemitic and stop antisemitism there's not. enough just get the real. [ __ ] you know what i'm saying get on kanye. talk about hitler still hollywood. cast bradley cooper ananju to. play that's fine by the way. dude it's fine it's so annoying. remember acting [ __ ] al pacino put a goddamn cuban in the push it to. the limit scarface whatever it was oh yeah. oh say hello to. my little friend that was a white. guy playing a not white. guy acting now i get it. white people have had more opportunity. and isn't that all okay. the other thing and i get it. that's not right yes i get that. okay that's fine but also dude. it's okay if bradley coop dogg. plays a jew all right. it's acting it's not like he's gonna be out. there like oh oh my god oh we spilled all the matzah. like he's not gonna be doing that. oh you vague i don't know how to. park the car it's all got these different. gadgets in it it's not like he's gonna be like that oh boy that's too it's not like he's walking around like oh that's too expensive. what do we do he's just [ __ ] nate you. know the guy had a little bit of a bigger. nose and and and and bradley cooper. the makeup the makeup people are probably. jewish and by the way. it's hollywood so the [ __ ] producers were jewish. so hollywood cast bradley cooper. and nonjew to. play jewish legend leonard. bernstein wow he's jewish uh and stuck a disgusting. exaggerated junos on him this. is what the stop antisemitism from twitter. is saying by the way being antisemitic. saying it this way. you know antisemitic when you're trying. to stop antisemitism and you said stuck. a disgusting exaggerated junos on them. um hey hey chill all while. saying no to jake gyllenhaal. and actually jewish man. who has dreamed of playing. bernstein for decades sickening hey check this. out dude joe i'll tell you what jake gylleno is such a good actor he would have [ __ ] done workouts to. get his nose bigger for real. jake gyllenhaal goes like jake gyllenhaal. is the [ __ ] because he knows how [ __ ] of a profession acting is so he's like you know what dude i'm gonna play a [ __ ] lion tamer put me in a a cage with lions for a year and a half. because acting is one ticket. to pussyville and i am going. to make it a hard. job so i can [ __ ] become the guy dude. what you saw that movie. southpaw hey jake gylleno is a boxer in it. dude his body is building. a sh a a [ __ ] brickhouse brick. i can't ever break. [ __ ] out what the [ __ ] is it i don't know he's he's stacked dude he's so stacked i would never like i'm not gay but i would you know i jerk. off in a room with him. if he was doing it. too and just like right. it's crazy and dude. he's so good he would think his nose. bigger and he's jewish. which is fine i didn't know. jake gyllenha was jewish but bradley cooper. is not jewish and he goes. like this knows me others. proclaimed it's jew face i like they're trying. to to hop on the bandwagon. a black face when it's like that. was actually a thing you know. uh the suggestion is that portrayal of bernstein. by cooper is a nonjew is it dude. i can't wait till the pendulum. swings and i'm playing a [ __ ] asian i swear. to god an asian woman. not trans an asian woman. born as a woman never thought. about changing genders just straight. up and i'm 11. in it you know. just [ __ ] caked on the makeup. just they have to. [ __ ] film every time they film me talking to. an adult they have to. dig a hole and i stay. i have to stand. in it because i gotta appear shorter than [ __ ] colin firth or whoever else is in it to. me the answer is okay. so so let's see what there. so the the suggestion is that portrayal of bernstein. by cooper is nonjew is akin to. the deeply offensive practice. of blackface it's not it's not news flash. it's not in which white actors once. done dark makeup okay yeah this was bad okay. this was bad okay. um and that brings us to. our initial question can a jew. be incredibly portrayed by. a nonjew to. me the answer is unambiguous absolutely draw. drawing from my own experiences. if i were still in the acting profession. to limit myself only to. playing italian or puerto. rican roles would just do. they should have honestly for real. got the guy from the allstate. commercials to play this guy to. play and and gave him. a big nose and white. faced him and just have him. be like i'm leonard i'm leonard. i'm famous hollywood producer. leonard bernstein that's my plan. is he doing the allstate. thing why is he standing in the middle. of a street during this. whole movie [laughter] dude. bro you know what the [ __ ] what's that. guy's name from allstate. dennis haysbert dude that. guy is the most distinguished man. in the world dude. i swear to. god that guy's so distinguished. he doesn't [ __ ] so distinguished. he like he'll fall in love. with a woman straight off looks and she'll fall in love. too and then she says well don't we have to. make love at some point. and he just goes like this. we don't have to. and they get married. and have kids without insemination. that's how respectable and if you don't talk. about i'm talking about the [ __ ] president. in 24. it's so crazy. how they made a black president. on tv before it happened. in real life dude that's hilarious. that's so backwards um dennis haysbert for president. and i mean it but he is in the one. of the top [ __ ] i would say at least top 10 movies. or i would say maybe top five. movies i saw it last night. dude dennis haysberg is in the movie. and i finally saw it. for the first time and i've been saving. this movie because i thought it would be good. to watch and i wanted to. save it till i could appreciate it. and dude it is the it. is first of all i'm going. to go ahead and say it. it's it's unfair to. call it an action movie but it is but it is the greatest. action movie of all time. period and that movie is heat. [music] dude are you i watched. first of all kristen goes like this. let's watch a movie and i say well. what do you want to. watch and she says let's watch oscar. nominated movies now your voice. cinema hey because he's cultured hey it's all good. hey you see them. all oh but i'm shifted to. this some i haven't seen right. turn on the insider. hey watch the insider oh good russell crowe he's pretty. good it was good russell core. is great insider's good michael. mann directed it so what popped. off after what popped up after that. i never saw insider. i know it was nominated. for best picture or something. uh russell crow was nominated. for best actor um that's by. the way really funny that russell crowe. was not me for best. actor and al pacino wasn't nominated. for best actor you know al pacino. was like oh that okay. whoa hey good good for oh that's great. good for good for the aussie. oh yeah good for where where the [ __ ] you from where's. he from all right there. you go who won. is that about heat what let me. see oh no they're gonna remake. it oh this oh i thought it. was the prequel prequel all. right well so i mean i gotta watch it. okay adam driver's gonna be in a prequel. to heat okay that's fine. that's okay i think that that's great. i always want to. make prickles i think they should make only prequels i don't think they should ever make sequels. sequels are a recipe for disaster. the [ __ ] is done. it's over if it's a great. movie it's all wrapped up and then more dude. always make a prequel. [ __ ] you make so much sense is that crystallia i think so dude. just make a prequel. boom money you get the money. and you get this if it's good. you get this how many sequels. are better than two. right they got [ __ ] um terminator and godfather right. or no not godfather what's the other. one i don't know [ __ ] there's one or two um and so thank you man. kristen is like let's watch it. so we watch inside the next. she falls is even 20. minutes yes dude. now i'm stuck watching russell. crowe do a [ __ ] american accent i swear. to god 20 minutes. in 20 minutes in let's watch a [ __ ] wait i almost want to. watch a good movie i've seen a lot. of the oscar winners so let's just watch the let's watch the we'll watch. a one that got nominated a lot. okay cool instead of oh she goes oh. i said go play 20. minutes later kristen kristen wig from bridesmaids. on the plane just and so now. i gotta watch the rest of the movie i don't want to. because it's three hours dude. movies should only be two. hours period we should be an hour. i i swear for real. even pocahontas is too. long and that's like an hour. and 10 minutes um and so now and the next night. what pops up in the algorithm. heat why because it's my command all right. dude i'm in look i like the way. michael man does it i really. like it i really like the way. he does it dude. and in his heyday in the 90s. he was apparently the [ __ ] and i just saw insider. and it was great so i'm like okay. i'm on a michael mansion so i turn on heat. because she says let's watch a movie i say okay. she said but let's go. in the bedroom i don't like to. watch movies or anything. or do anything in bed. except sleep and doing but she wants to. hang out in the bed. like it's a [ __ ] like it's hide she wants to. hang out in the bed. like it's a [ __ ] like it's an apple beast. like it's so she's well why can't we go. up and i'm like uh can we watch a movie. and can you not be on your phone. and can we not go. to sleep and if we if we can do that. then okay she says okay what more. you want to. see i say heat she goes like this. okay so i go like this. the dax stacked she said. it now this is a good thing. because either i get to. watch the whole movie heat. or i catch her in a like even better. the next morning i wake up. and i go like this. well well well i come down like some crazy. [ __ ] villain well somebody fell asleep there didn't they what you don't know is i've already poisoned your cup your coffee. um so i'm watching so we turn on heat. and i go like this. huh right off the bat. interesting there's so many moving pieces. what the [ __ ] who's this. guy i keep doing that. because i keep introducing more characters and then i forget about the characters and then go back. to the characters and i go like this. huh forgot about that guy. but yeah i guess he is going. through his own kind of mental. turmoil i watch the movie. i had a mouth was open. 85 percent of the time. and not cause i was eating. i legit that movie. is so good and i can't stop thinking about it. yes now i know everyone's only like it's [ __ ] heat dude you should have watched it you should have watched it already. but i was saving. it and i'm so glad i did because now i'm 43. and i got to. watch heat when i was 43. when the [ __ ] did you get to. see heat when you couldn't appreciate it. no my brother asked me. when he was going. to when has calvin scene jingle. all the way and i say he's not ready. yet he says how he's not ready. he's three and a half. i say because dude. think about it you're watching movie. during christmas and last christmas. he wasn't even three next. christmas he'll [ __ ] watch it can't wait to. watch jingle all the way with calvin and that's the point. of this whole story but he is awesome. to jingle all the way. is [ __ ] hilarious oh the turbo. man i got to. get the table man. sinbad should be in legitimately every single movie. sinbad is one of the funniest. dude that guy in movies. is the funniest house guest. dude when his hands were on them. was that him or was that. phil harmon doing the thing dude. when his hands are all numb. holy and the turbum a good look at the table man. i get to get the table. man oh dude they really killed jingle. all the way um but anyway uh uh oh this. clip is i think this might be you talk. about up your alley. this might be the most up. my alley [ __ ] i can't. even believe did has this guy ever this. guy must have had the best. mom of all time. to think he could get away. with this lie i didn't go. to college but um i turned it. down oh yeah i turned it. down just to. do this just the ground. from the rap so you had an opportunity. to do the driving thing. a scholarship and everything. rap um i think it was like in jacksonville. yeah big a big band in jacksonville. it's a big college though. they're lying and they offered me. like fitting some [ __ ] like 10 million. or

something. like that hey man. you're not 175 years old. you remember you're 30. dude. yeah what the [ __ ] are we doing here. like what i'm saying but i was so younger. like wait wait i didn't know what it. was are you sure the average you five million dollars. it's hard to. down he was a scholarship. like i had to. go to school. for this decade this. guy this guy another ship. is [ __ ] this guy's talking about employment. dude this is such a i had to. go for college this decade. i had to go to. college for this decade. right to get paid. at it was 15. or 5 million dollars i didn't go. to

dude where'd you get a scholarship from um dude. making it up the city. he picked was perfect though. because it's a big city. that nobody really knows about jacksonville. you know if he was like honestly any other big city. would have [ __ ] that up chicago. oh well what is it. oh no jacksonville be like people give you grace. with that i think it. was like in jacksonville. yeah big a big band in jacksonville. it's a big college though. and they offered me like fitting. some [ __ ] like 10 million or something like that. five million something like that. a scholarship okay but not. five million dollars this is the the best. part this guy's so good. at like this guy had the best. mom of all time. because he he he his mom. was always like you know you could do anything. and you're the best he would trip. and fall and she would be like that's the ground. fall honey like this guy just believes in himself. whatever he's saying no matter what. they have to. do five million dollars that my favorite. part is when he goes yeah. what the [ __ ] are we doing here. for y'all like that's what i'm saying. but i was so younger. like so yeah are you sure. they average you five million. dollars [laughter] dude the deflection didn't say yes or no. turned it down dude you want to. be why can't i be friends. with guys like this i try try. to be friends with guys like this. you know but it's like i can't. because they're just utterly [ __ ] terrible. you know what who is this. guy a football player. rapper because he would get a scholarship for sports. right not for rapping. but he said i'm in his rap. game i mean this guy's so confused. you know that's the best. lie i've ever heard in my life. and it's such a good. lie that i believe him school. for this decade it. was a scholarship like i had. to go to school. for this decade the best. was the face when he realized he could say. he had to go to. school for the decade like he's like oh i could get away. with this um

like they're doing. what like dude first of all russians. don't give a [ __ ] about anything and they don't even have. to eat for real. they don't they could go. dude russians are so hardcore. they can do they could easily go and i mean. and i mean easily they could easily go you know. the football player that. says he's only been drinking. water for three months russians. laugh in that guy's face. russians can go and i mean. it easily they could go and i'm a scientist. so you know this but they could go 180. days without eating 180. days and drinking only every third. day at day 180 they would be like a hip to. maybe eat something and they drink. tabasco sauce and they'd be like this. is good enough dude. russians don't you think. dominoes what the [ __ ] are they gonna do dude oh domino's imagine a russian being like they're taking dominoes away from this i don't care we have so many pizza i can just eat whatever but also it doesn't matter just because domino's did this i will now not eat till war is over [ __ ] them 140. dude that's a huge hit this. just means that domino's was failing. in russia by the way. there's no way if it was lucrative that. they would ever do this. there is no [ __ ] way imagine and also how about everyone who's just out. of a job these aren't even the [ __ ] things that are the problem now you got people that are just like i can't see feed my

costly for western companies to. sell their russian businesses and it. has in some cases cease control. of firms local assets and all right. so with increasing leach it's a quote it was increasingly. challenging our environment dpr. russia dp russia's immediate. holding company is now compelled to. take this step which will bring about. the termination of the attempted. sale process of dp russia. as going concerning what the [ __ ] are they saying the company operates 142. stores in russia and the country's third largest. pizza delivery business that's crazy. dude hopefully it's not a domino.
