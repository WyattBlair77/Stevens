[ __ ] man just absolute dork. stuff and here's the deal. dude i they were happy. to have me the people. at the theater because i sold it. out they would if if if the if the festival was making bags. then they wouldn't have had me do that. weekend it's not my fault. i didn't even know about the dorky. ass weekend until you. know people were thrashing me. online so there you go. dude i forgot to. talk about it on stage. they honestly it's probably better. i didn't because the people in the audience. wouldn't even have known what. the hell i was talking. about because the as is so dorky. dude and that's a radio at it. um so yeah but i was in pittsburgh. which dude oh well first of all i mean. first of all american airlines i didn't know. you sucked what's going. on american airlines you united. you suck are you united. did you hire some cats. from united to come over. and operate your uh business. american h first of all have a direct flight from los angeles. to pittsburgh yay dude pittsburgh too is too big. of a city to. not have direct fl yay and don't just have. southwest or spirit airlines have more options. yay dude conspir don't have. a plug to. plug in your charger do. so you so your phone. dieses on the flight yay he dude. i didn't take sp. but dude so we took american. okay dude and it's like um i took american. and like um i had to. connect so like and like i did. it and where did i have to. connect dallas no that's too. far south naturally now that's too far. south to go up. there i gotta go pittsburgh. i go back down there. that's too far south dude. is it yes dude. so i went to. dallas oh and i got on the plane. in los angeles and i'm on american. now here's the deal american some of your planes. really be banging they really. be great and some of your planes. are just absolutely regular from. 2001 update it hey hey hey update it okay so i'm on the plane and we're sitting on the plane for 45. minutes and guess what here's a real kicker. we're not in the air yet. oh oh yeah dude so i'm not steaming really. until i get a text. message from my tour manager. uh in on the plane because we don't we're not. sitting near each other hey we're going to. have to book it for our connection. and i go like this. i forgot i forgot we got to. book it to. the i forgot there's a connection. dude so i go we finally take off. 45 minutes in and i'm like we're not. going to make it. and he's like we'll make it we just got to. run so we they do the thing. where we land and it's like where they're like. ladies and gentlemen please there's. some connections so if you could not you. know get off the plane if you don't. have a connection the people with connections. are going to. be trying to make it cuz they we really were [ __ ] everyone so they're going to. actually we got to. make it really we got to. we got they're going to. have to run. we're they're going to. have to [ __ ] run hopefully they're in tiptop shape. shape because the dallas airport is actually 17 miles long and we will never ever ever make sure that a connecting flight is the next gate. over we'll never do that. so what we'll do is we'll have to. make it so it's four miles away. so you have to. take a tram and you'll have to. judge whether or not. running or taking the tram. is quicker and no matter what you choose. you'll be wrong okay. so ladies and gentlemen. just make sure if you don't have a connection. just just sit tight and you're not. going to listen. to this okay thanks bye so i'm like all right. we [ __ ] get up of course everyone. gets up not just the people. don't have connections i got to. boot pass everyone i'm. the first guy running. i take the tram get there. okay now dude yes he looked at his watch. yes because he was technical. and yes he wanted to. [ __ ] stick it to. him on the podcast. yes dude the flight was at whatever. 35 whatever hour it was 35. that's when the flight was yes dude. he got to. the gate at whatever the hour. was 27 he's got 7 minutes. now now you got to. get there earlier than that. i understand i understand and i get the rules. you got to be there. 15 minutes before to. have a [ __ ] shot to. get on the plane what. to to have the you just got to. be there right there's still a shot. you can make it if you get within 15. minutes but maybe not so i get there. and the lady at the gate. is like sorry it's closed. and i say oh come on dude. there was so many people on the flight. that i was on for pittsburgh. there were so many people on that. flight to. pittsburgh so now what they gave away. the seats oh they gave away. the seats so now they give away. the seats to the people. who flying on standby. so now it's better. for them for their pockets they don't give a [ __ ] about our hearts. yes dude they don't care about our hearts. they don't care about our. souls american airline you only care. about the pockets so i say i walk. up to the lady. and i say they say you got to. go to gate whatever 24 to. get the you got to. go to gate 24 to. for them to that's a customer help. so i go to. gate 24 it's not customer help. dude it's not customer help. customer help is next to. gate 24 but she said it's at gate. 24 so guess what i do. i wait at gate. 24 because i know. that the person at gate. 24 can fix the problem. and i know that's not what i'm supposed. to do but that's what the [ __ ] lady said so i'm going. to play by the rules. in case it doesn't work. out it's not my fault. dude so i get there. and she says is your name. chris and i say yes she says can i get a picture. with you and i said well can you help. me she says oh well let me see if i can my son. loves you and i'm like you're not even. the one that [ __ ] loves me. okay she says well what happened. i said well they said i can't. make the thing and i need another another flight. to pittsburgh so can you please put me on another. the next closest flight to. pittsburgh and she say o i don't know if we have another flight to. pittsburgh tonight and i said i bet. there's a way to. figure it out she says i don't know. so she goes and she says dude. she goes she goes oh. no dude you dude hey hey hey class. who wants to be talking. to someone who's behind a computer. and they go oh nobody's hands. raised because that's the worst position. to be in no. one wants that oh and i say what and she says you know. when something happens and you think how how many times in your life. have you have has something happened and you immediately. think oh oh so i'll never forget. this moment there's only before and after right. there's this moment. that's happened and you never know. the moment that's going. to happen because the moment. comes you got to. grab it oh and it's away. oh here comes the moment. you don't know when it's coming. but it happens you're like whoa. it came and it went by. oh no that's seared into. my brain now she says to. me ah is there. anywhere else you can go i'm i i'm i'm in dallas. right now i need to. go to pittsburgh. she says is there anywhere. else you can go like what. i just what i'm i going. to just instead of go. to work take a trip. to [ __ ] aruba what do you mean oh well i'll just change everyone's lives and i'll go to. ottawa what do you mean. can i go somewhere else dude. i couldn't believe the words that came. out of her mouth that i didn't even respond. correctly she said is there. anyone where else you can. go and i said me. that's not even a response. to that like i i don't know. if i even thought like is she talking. to someone near me. i'm making sure i i think i was thinking i i have to. make sure this is me in this. situation right now so i said to. her me and she said well. there's no flight to. pittsburgh today it would have to. be tomorrow and i said well i can't go anywhere. else i have to. go to pittsburgh. and she says well h. there's a real early well. you can can you go to. raleigh oh hey no do you want. to go to raleigh tomorrow at 700. a.m. and then pittsburgh anti i'm anti. that absolutely not what pull me. in pittsburgh hey i need to. be where the pirates play. hey i need to. play where the be where the penguins play. hey i need to. where the where the steelers play hey pittsburgh. you got too many. teams oh come on give me. to pittsburgh [ __ ] i didn't say it wanted to. a come on [ __ ] didn't say it would never feel bad i even said on the podcast. but it's a joke. i don't think women are [ __ ] but give in pittsburgh. so she says i don't think there's anything we can do. and i say i bet. there is so now i'm talking to. my tour manager no no so now. i'm like well she's like why. don't you go over to. customer service i'm like all right.

killer thing or whatever you know it's like two. episodes and this guy is talking about the the um zodiac. killer and the whole thing. about this miniseries which is two hours. it's two episodes they're each like an hour. and some is is that he is. like he you learn when you watch. the thing is this is the guy. who has this theory that's nobody's had this. theory before but or i've never heard it but he's like he basically says there. was no zodiac killer and it was all separate. murders that separate people did and once the news. and the media started running. with the zodiac killer thing. people would start to. kill who they wanted and just do the zodiac. killer thing because they know. that they'd get off because they wouldn't be investigated. for the other murders and even if they fit the description. for one murder it. didn't link or jive with the zodiac. killer theme so they would get away. scott free this was this. guy's theory he wrote a book. about it and i'm like first of all genius. if i ever to. kill someone i'm writing a zodiac. killer note to. you know what i mean. whatever cuck ass the rolling rolling stone or like [ __ ] whatever woke ass [ __ ] cuck ass [ __ ] that's going to. be out of business. soon or the la times. you know just hey uh i am. the zodiac killer i i'm sorry. here i had to. kill you know the guy who my opener or i mean. chris is opener because you know. whatever it is and here's a crypt. cryptology thing about it and just put some random designs and like penises. and a and and like a [ __ ] fish. and like dildos and [ __ ] and tits and they just are like oh wait we don't know what to. make of this you know. and they can't show it. in the news but there's another crypto. crypto cryp thing whatever they call it uh but the guy was like bro. first of all he has a shirt he's wearing a shirt. with [ __ ] like one of those hawaiian not a hawaiian kind of a hawaiian shirt. with uh pineapples and flowers on it. and i go best friend. from now on best friend. everyone else gets moved down. a notch a guy like that in his 50s who wears a shirt. with pineapples and flowers on it. best friend immediately okay so i'm watching this. and the guy the guy the documentarian puts. it to him. he's like so what you're saying. is there's no zodiac. killer and there were just random killings that. were trying to uh uh that were that. were oneoffs that that you know. and and and and the zodiac. killer was a literary um design. that people just fictionalized and the guy goes like this. the cuz the the documentarian put him to. him he's like to. put him back on his heels. like the guy you would think a normal. person would be like well i mean. the facts come you know. if you the guy goes like this. looks at the dude. and says big go and i fell in love. with a man romantically that's that's the kind of [ __ ] confidence i want to. have man and i mostly do but sometimes. you get [ __ ] up you know like when i was talking to. the uh flight attendant cuz there was no. wifi in a flight and i wanted. to say hey where's the wifi. and i wanted her to. be like on back on. her feet be like well we don't have we don't i said where's the wifi. and she said you don't know. we haven't had wifi for a year on these planes i i go. she got me i want. to have that bingo confidence. and if you don't have bingo confidence. let me tell you something. dude you don't have passion. in your life you don't have passion. you're living your life dayto. day you might as well be a z. zombie zombie zombie dude i'm good but. yo you got to. have that bingo mentality that. bingo confidence look people in the eyes when i'm talking to. someone and i need something or if i just you know. i people oh you got charisma whatever yeah i could use that if i want. but guess what sometimes i don't sometimes. i imagine eating the person. i'm talking to. his face and that's a straight up. 100% life hack for you. i'm imagining eating their face okay. say whatever you want oh chryst. is crazy oh chris i don't do. it and i never would but i imagine doing it. because if you're imagining consuming someone when you're talking to. them you win no matter what happens. cu even if you don't get what. you want you go like this. ah whatever i ate you in my head. you got to imagine picking things. off their face and eating all right. well we'll get demonetized i'm not a serial. killer but all i'm saying is yeah. that's that bingo mentality i. don't know if the guy from the document documentary. would agree with me. but i'm just like you know. what's bingo you know what's bingo ean call. 911 that's bingo mentality dude. nathan call 911 he sang it. you know that's the beginning. of a of a of a song in a musical. he does that and then it goes. bl like that's how that's how dope. it was watch nathan call 911. where you going shut up. oh he's in the car. oh no it's beautiful. man um i guess it doesn't always work out. when you're that confident right. because i did when i forgot my. bags and she said there's nothing we can. do i said i bet. there is and i looked her. in the eyes i still had to. go to [laughter].
