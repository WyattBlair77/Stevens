yeah yeah and so now what. it turned into. some color so dude. i look great so i was sitting there. all tan in gorgeous traffic. and it's fine you do. look better with a little bit of attention. i know i got i got to. but you know what laying out. in the sun you know. what it is it's boring. you can't look at your phone. because it's too bright. you start sweating and you can't. read a book it's too. bright you can read a. book it's too bright no i don't agree we can listen. to a [ __ ] podcast you can read a book. you can listen to. a podcast and also be like doing doper. [ __ ] though like what i wish being in the sun was more. fun this is what i think that. you should be this is what i think should happen. if you sit in the sun because being in the sun is. healthy right i mean to. a degree to. a degree right. to not i mean not you're not. going to [ __ ] want to. be out there all the time. and just like with you with no. protection but to. a degree it's nice. so here's what the lord. should do when you're out. in the sun chilling you should. get to jizz just chilling. not even touching anything. sexual you should just it sh. you should be have a lowgrade jizz. like this it's a steady. stream like a lowgrade edging. no the problem the problem. with that is no one. would ever get out of the sun. so the lord should not do that. but it only works but it only works. for like 30 minutes and then you and then it stops right. and you bust you know. what you know what that. made me think of that a lot. of things make me think of when i was a kid. i read michael crichton's terminal man. yeah and there's a passage in the book. about it's like about how the brain. is manipulated yeah through. like putting nodes on it and you can like let the person. in an experiment tap the certain buttons that connect. to certain parts of the brain. yeah and there's a part in the book. early on it's just a really short. part but i think about all the time. where a guy was allowed. to give an access to. a button yeah that helped him. jizz that that set off an orgasm. in his brain not in on his body. but in his brain. and he turned into. like a drooling [ __ ] up like massive bone. and skin who was like. unable to do anything. except like [ __ ] hit that button uh yeah but he didn't have he didn't jizz. he was just a brain. yeah he just kept yeah. yeah yeah so that's that's what that's the level. of uh [ __ ] we're talking about here so i don't think the lord as you put it the lord should do that [ __ ] terrifying it's scary. that's why it stuck with me. i was like 12 and i was like yeah. well also what's [ __ ] 12 reading the terminal. no you shouldn't you definitely shouldn't. yeah but i did that yeah. yeah [ __ ] 11 years. old reading the andromeda strain oh yeah i think it. was the intro media. string all right so uh all right. well dude that's that's probably why you [ __ ] you're [ __ ] up right i read jurassic park i read congo. i read [ __ ] and android media. strain did you read them. in drama stream yeah i mean. terminal man i read congo. that's it you only read. i read congo yeah and i read jurassic park. the same idiot i know and again. tim curry in congo the same. idiographics over and over again that character. is legendary what i realized. i looked up tim curry. and congo and so many people have pulled. clips and put that [ __ ] up on youtube. really yeah it's like a famous. thing yeah wow i mean. it was to. us when we were young. but wow i didn't realize it. was to the world. how [ __ ] amazing would he be at a dinner party you know what i mean you were just like you everyone had some talking like shut the [ __ ] up dude tim curry's here yeah tim curry. has done some of the greatest. [ __ ] ever on screen. so yeah yeah me too so um all right. so so let's do uh let's do let's get into. it you know what let's get into. it let's do hi. i'm matt hi chris um one week. ago i went to. the swimming pool to. meet my uh friend uh when i arrived. a little bit earlier and i was in cubicle getting. changed and i could hear my uh friend. in the next cubicle on a telephone call. and it's kind of a lot. of agreeing a lot. of mmhmm all that kind of noise. um and then about 10 15. seconds later i hear and say that. was the best [ __ ] i've ever had so i was going like jesus. and then five seconds after that. i hear another guy say that's no. problem oh wow so i stayed in that cubicle and i waited. until the normal time should have met. him so it's like nothing. strange right but i wanted. to ask would you tell the friend. that you heard that situation. or would you just let it. go and wait for him. to tell you either way. who cares you know. the heart wants what the heart. wants but i just wanted to. ask for your opinion thanks. very much guys have a nice day. bye it's so funny. that you have to. say at the end like it. doesn't matter i'm cool with whatever. which is cool yeah of course. it is but you do need to. say that i think though. actually i know but it's funny. that you have to. right because it's like you don't want him. he doesn't want to. come off as being like [ __ ] i think it's not funny. because it makes you think of all. the people that wouldn't be okay. with it and then that makes me want to. cry so it's a deeper. like you know what you know. you read all those [ __ ] up books. when you were tweeting maybe so maybe uh it's deeper. i'm a sensitive guy i'm in touch with the universe. i'm in touch with michael. creighton books when i was 11. so um so i read so much. john grisham when i was 10. so um so uh so the guy got sucked off okay he was at the pool am i getting that right. he was at the pool. the guy didn't know he got sucked. off and the [ __ ] friend was right next to. him in his [ __ ] uh odd future hat now the guy got sucked off and that's fine but this is what you do when that happens bro okay you go like this received information received he's sealing an envelope he's putting it somewhere he's putting it in his shirt pocket. and he's leaving it there. and you keep it you keep it. for rainy days it's just there oh what are you. a [ __ ] villain you're gonna no no you're not a villain but what if the guy's a villain you have to. keep the [ __ ] wow dude what if the guy's a villain. dude you got to. look out for yourself. dude okay well here's here's what i would do. but the topic was gorgeous but what i would do is what i would do. first of all is this man. your friend is he in the closet. or is he or he was in the bathroom. no but is he if it depends on if he's in the closet. he's in the closet he doesn't know. okay so let's say he's in the closet. then i think bringing it up. with him is an absolute no. no because why why why like push that why. why even poke that bear. there's no reason to. uh but if you if you if he is gay. or if he's openly even bisexual. absolutely bring it up and [ __ ] make fun of him. for you god damn hilarious. so he got sucked off. in a [ __ ] wet bathroom. huh yeah yeah so what. made you so what made you think i wouldn't hear that. yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so why. did you think that i wouldn't. know that yeah but uh if he's in the closet. dude yeah that's that's sensitive [ __ ] i wouldn't yeah i wouldn't kick that hornet's. nasty uh yeah yeah yeah yeah. yeah uh but also save it for a rainy. day right so basically what you're saying. is safe for rainy day so we agree. same amount i think i. i that that is so [ __ ] funny though. dude oh yeah i would love to. see that guy his eyes. slowly each time something happened get bigger and bigger be like yeah yeah his eyes. popping out of his [ __ ] head he's [ __ ] my favorite part. was when he was thinking well. thinking like wow that's some phone. call right right right mmhmm just like god wow he must be getting. a return back that he didn't think. he was at amazon or something. the greatest news of all. time yes it's a huge rebate. yeah oh [ __ ] this rebate oh this calm rebate it's so funny oh my god rebate. in your mouth oh hell yeah. swallowed that rebate such a bad disguise. you know so poorly covering up what's oh. [ __ ] oh [ __ ] grab under there with that rebate. can't think of another word. to cover for it. i mean yeah that's right. that's right and save it for rainy. day you never know when you might need it i don't know. about that but i guess technically you are saving. it for any day if you're not telling me. exactly there we go. yeah yeah so that's let's keep it. hilarious though and please never forget. that story because that is [ __ ] well we won't it's now immortalized yeah i never will on lifeline all right. what we got hey chris. hemanha is doing it. it's a [ __ ] um i need you guys um advice something's up. something's afoot my roommate who's also my cousin. oh uh i love the death. uh oh you know this. but he's a conspiracy. theorist oh [ __ ] and i don't know what to. say when he tells me things and i don't know what to. say when he asks me things. because politics piece [ __ ] and i don't like that [ __ ] so i don't know i don't like to. be involved and i need advice. to you know i don't know. because like things you saying like i don't know if i even you know. believe you because like yeah you know. wow i think sometimes it's good. for these people especially if you aren't interested. in politics and don't actually know how to. debunk the person because that's let's face it. not gonna do anything anyway ask. him to if if you have the tolerance for it. ask him to prove. it and say i don't know about this. stuff show me what you're talking. about because what you're explaining. sounds [ __ ] wild don't say crazy say wild um it sounds gorgeous. oftentimes when you do that. that person will show you something. that is the opposite of proof. yeah they're just like the clouds. it'll be like a meme some person. made with jfk's face on it. and say like something about the cia. on top and then something. about everyday life on the bottom you. know and just like that's proof of what. proof of what they're like look. trash can paul posted this. yeah exactly yeah dude. dude look at his account. you know what it's two. thousand followers it's a picture of christian bale smiling. right yeah exactly yeah saying biden is a lizard. right or the other thing. you can do is just if you just want. to disengage and have him. stop just just say you believe him. just be like oh oh oh [ __ ] all the time. yeah and just let him. really yeah jfk is that guy. yeah right yeah oh my god jfk. junior's alive and that's him. yeah dude i don't i i don't understand. what it is about conspiracy. theorist people that they they like why do they have to. always be convincing you of [ __ ] it's like the new religion it's like i don't give a [ __ ] okay so you believe that that's [ __ ] cool i don't even give a [ __ ] dude i like weirdos i like if you think joe biden is a lizard that's [ __ ] awesome well but stop talking about it so [ __ ] much to. me and don't make me try. and think it i don't give a [ __ ] that's all part. of it though that's part. of the appeal they're in. the secret the group. of secret knowledge that kabob possesses the secret knowledge and it's part. of why it's appealing. to them and furthermore what appeals to. them even more is getting. other people to think about what. they're saying and to. actually come on board with their [ __ ] do you think if they knew it was true. they wouldn't try and spread the information. or is it like a super saiyan. secure thing where they're just like. i gotta get people to. [ __ ] it's like dude mormons secretly no come on dude. i think a lot of this. [ __ ] i think a lot of it is true. is actual some kind of at least. adjacent to mental. illness yeah yeah yeah yeah so i don't know. i i don't know what the [ __ ] going. on in their minds in fact. i've thought about it and read. about it so much. because it fascinates the [ __ ] out. of me there's almost never any convincing. it's like an addict like you. don't convince an addict. to stop taking the thing that they're taking that's ruining their lives. they just are gonna do it. until they're ready to not do it. and a conspiracy theorist. is either gonna just change and come to. realize it but they're rarely. rarely rarely gonna ever be sh. have proof shown that is gonna make them change. their [ __ ] mind which this guy can't even do anyway because he doesn't like politics. wow yeah um wow i wish i knew what kind of conspiracy. theories this guy's talking about that's the thing. about conspiracy theorists that. they don't just believe in one. of them yeah they all believe in all. of them which makes them suspect. even more yeah yeah of course they're like dude. joe biden's a lizard. it was a cup this. was a coverup that happened. we didn't land on the. moon right [ __ ] all this other [ __ ] the earth is flat yeah the earth is flat bill. gates is injecting us with hiv. whatever the [ __ ] it is you know what i mean yep 3g 5g 5g. [ __ ] yeah yeah um and uh i believe in all of it dude. i believe in all of it. well i imagine how stressed [ __ ] out you would be if you believed in all of it well i think that's another part of the allure you get to. be stressed out about [ __ ] that is way out of your control. instead of being stressed out. about paying your bills it's more. exciting i do that with my ocd. yes dude [ __ ] yeah dude i turned the lights on and off a million times because i can't deal with my anxiety. dude amazing dude amazing dude. well it's similar though it's yeah. it is similar yeah yeah okay. cool well made me sad. yeah there we go. okay next one bro yeah hi. chris and matt so a few years. ago my husband and i bought our first house. in the midwest it. happened to have a pool. in the backyard we also have neighbors. who next door have you know. two sons they're 14 18. somewhere around there and ever since. we moved in every summer. they always have asked us. if they can come to. swim in our pool um and so you know. we don't have a relationship. with these people other than you know. waving to them when they're mowing the lawn. and you know to. give you a specific example one. day it was the hottest day. of the year and we can see them. over there nobody's going on they're trimming trees. and just absolutely drenched in sweat. and we get a text. from the mom and it's one. it's the younger son asking us. you know can me my dad. and my brother come swim in your pool. and so we just don't respond. because yeah good no. and then because we didn't respond. they come and knock on our door. and ask us again. you know if they can swim in our. pool and this happens. all the time and so we have summer. season coming up and so you know. we really need to. know do we need to. move how do we respond. to this once and for all please help. me that's a brutal. one dude that is a brutal. one so [ __ ] uh that's just that's bad like that hurts my heart. like what a [ __ ] whole situation. yeah you gotta just you gotta just be together. when you answer the door. next time and say we're just this is not a public. pool we're we're we're not really ready. or we don't feel right. having other people just come over. to our [ __ ] property whenever they [ __ ] want you say yeah but you have to. sleep in our beds and also eat all. of our food and they probably won't even. get the pictures you have to. pay our bills you know. what you have to. you know wow that's so [ __ ] [ __ ] up this is gonna be on fear thy neighbor someone's winding up dead this is how fear the neighbor starts i know i bring this up a lot yeah i hate i hate people like this this father is raising such little pieces of [ __ ] to. think that this is okay. to [ __ ] do yeah this is a [ __ ] nightmare person yeah jeez it is but also uh the the thing about this is just say oh you know what happened dude and i would do this if i was the husband i would i would go out there and i would say this is so embarrassing i [ __ ] in the pool and it's got we have to drain it and then have it come back and then every time they ask say the same thing yeah i [ __ ] in it again you could definitely do that yeah yeah and then they would stop asking it'd be like are you do they keep [ __ ] in the break i don't give a [ __ ] dude that's a that's actually that'd be amazing if you want to because here's why dude then you get to have them not be in your pool yeah and have a little bit of fun with it yeah yeah have a little bit of fun with it dude this is the thing they're trying to mess up your day every situation even if it's bad can be good dude take a problem add another problem and then it's better right so just like i think [ __ ] like that's my [ __ ] dude i mean if you want to battle crazy with crazy then definitely do that yeah if you want it just to stop entirely both answer the door have it be both of you and both of you say one and then the other can speak whatever units in the united front like this is not something we're comfortable with moreover it's not something we even want so like we're not gonna allow you guys to use our pool you know i would say we don't even really know you dude yeah you're just neighbor you just happen to be near us yes exactly so don't be in my pool bro that's so insane wow dude she could even say just like i wouldn't let like some random stranger from the next town over right in my pool i wouldn't let you swim in my pool we don't know you and even if we did we don't want someone in and out of our property whenever they want i have a little bit fun with it dude this is an opportunity you got to have fun with it they're creating stress for you yeah deal with it the way you want to in the most fun way to be the. husband and say the better. you know because a woman does. it because they would believe you i [ __ ] in the pool i'm sorry and i keep sitting in the pool. i don't know what's going. on with me man. i gotta go to. therapy every time i get in i just [ __ ] yeah dude it actually sucks but sell it be like it really really really is terrible. every time i one time. i walked by and i just wanted to. see if it was warm. so i put my

[ __ ] it's all good i was going this way anyway to. meet my brother go eat and he was like oh dude. i would i'll i'll come man. mistake yeah i would love. to come i'll take on your part. yeah now but but in my defense. dude i was like well who the i mean. i didn't think this was a possibility. dude you don't i didn't even know the guy. she should have thought about it. and i had texted text. i was like matt i don't know what to. do this guy came you know. what you should have said oh [ __ ] it's gonna text my brother canceled i'm just gonna go home i'll drop you off and then i'd go yeah and then he would have [ __ ] went anyway we could just go and then show up i show up and you're there and we're i'm just like and he's just like you know you text me pretend we're not brothers and [ __ ] yeah you have to. get out of it. who's that guy that looks like you. oh my god dude yeah whatever happened. to that guy i don't even know where he is. that's that's he was wearing a chicago. cubs out i remember that. he was in chicago. so from chicago all right. cool only guy from chicago would do that. so all right cool next what's up. chris what's up matt what's going. on he's going through some hard. times thank you my advice. that i need is i need i need to. know like how to. head so much go and approach women like i need advice. on that like whether it's if i'm out or wherever. you know like how do i go. if i if i think to. myself oh you know she's pretty like how do i go. and talk to them. like i find that like i don't know. just like awkward so that. and i don't know how to. just start a conversation so yeah. just let me know thank you. shout out that's a patreon. subscriber dude uh for uh my podcast. uh it's tough because it's completely. scenario dependent sometimes the scenario just doesn't allow a situation for you to. do it sometimes it's just the situation. you can't come up with a good. scenario on how to. approach someone and you kind of leave it. at that because the last thing. you want to. do is actually encroach on someone's life. or time or in their space. you know it's like there. are a few scenarios where that's just it's not. possible so in those scenarios. forgive yourself for not. being able to. do it but uh in times where it's like a setting where that is sort of i don't. want to say allowed. because it's allowed. everywhere but like when it's when it's more sort of common. to approach people who are strangers. or whatever um i think it's totally scenario. dependent like where you are. what time it is who you're with who they're. with like and i think it. needs to be as organic. as possible but i think maybe what you're struggling with is. it's it's not there is no. answer of how to. do it there's only an answer. of you you have to. do it because like there's no howto there's just like when it arises. you're either going to. live with regret for not doing. it oh man or do it. and and potentially fail. yeah what you're dealing. with is the potential of failure. and what you got to. realize is that is kind of minuscule compared to. regret dude failing is nothing. regret is is everything i think john lennon said. that you know what dude. it's like are you gonna die. you're gonna die bro. just go back to. your thing you're gonna die. bro just [ __ ] go out there and do it well you want to. have a family right. you want to. grow i mean maybe you don't maybe you just want. to get laid do. the horizontal mambo but bro. you got to [ __ ] get out. there and do this this. is why you're here on. this earth is to. keep the species moving and you're just sitting. back bro you're just sitting back letting a girl. walk by outside of a cafe and you're just sitting there drinking that. hot coffee like oh i wish i could bro. this is your life. man you wear that sweater. that says life rips make it rip. [ __ ] you gotta say hey and guess what you might it's not that you might fail you're gonna you're gonna fail you're gonna fail and guess what you're gonna fail again and again and again and again and then pretty soon you're you're not going to. fail eventually you're not going. to fail and it's going. to lead to laying down. horizontally and it's going to. lead to splurting and it's going. to lead to nine. months down the line and you're going. to have a baby. and then it's going to. lead to having a family. and then those kids are going to. grow up and you're going to. be able to. tell them life ripped for me. man and i went out. there while i was drinking. my hot coffee and your mom. walked by and i was insecure. but finally it worked you know. i hit on so many. girls and none of them. wanted me and the only one. that accepted me was your mom. okay and i guess maybe that makes her a loser. but it doesn't matter because we're losers. take care yeah you should have stopped halfway. through but the one thing i would say and then when i laid down. horizontally with your mom and split it. in or you came out. maybe he just wants an actual companion he's not. thinking about splurting just yet. i guess but the big thing is whatever. you're seeking just do the rest of us. guys and all women a [ __ ] favor and just don't be a [ __ ] gross. creep yeah yeah yeah don't be a [ __ ] gross. creep when you do it right. don't ever be in a scenario. where you could leave it. and the girl or woman leaves. thinking oh my god that guy. was such a [ __ ] creep. but sometimes you're not in control. of that you think conversations. are going to. go a certain way and then you say something. [ __ ] up by mistake or whatever the [ __ ] and then they come away with a different experience it's two people bro well there i guess there's a dry area there's also a completely obvious area of creepdem that you should never ever ever [ __ ] enter it sucks nobody likes it it's a [ __ ] absolute lie that the kind of guy who's like cat calling or being a [ __ ] creep. ever ever ever gets the result yeah. he's looking for yeah. it's just not [ __ ] true and nobody wants it yeah. it's bad women hate it. and it's bad for other [ __ ] men because it makes them look bad right. it's mostly just old white construction. workers and also young puerto. ricans that do that but yeah um uh yeah. dude catcalling is crazy. but just be like hey what's up. you got you know what i mean. like you got kids remember i knew. this girl once i knew that this chick. told me that that was the best. line the way the guy. hit on her she said i said she said the best. way a guy ever hit on. me he came up he said you got kids. really yeah i'm confused. why is that good because she thought it. was so funny and then they started talking i mean. she never went out with him. but he got married. no yeah i know and that. man was me no and uh no it's but the thing there's no right. line or phrase or topic. it's just situation dependent but the thing. to keep in mind. is the things not to. do don't go away. with regret and don't be a [ __ ] creep. it's better to. be rejected than live with regret. rejection is nothing you'll forget. about it by [ __ ] dinner time it doesn't matter also different. people are different you know. like one time i heard on a i was watching a tv. show and this this woman was saying like they were talking it. was like i don't know what the hell. i was watching but they were asking different. women what the best way to. hit on them was and one woman said like it's best. honestly if they just come up. to me and say you want. to [ __ ] oh my god yeah i know and that is 99 of women. would find that [ __ ] appalling. my point is there's people out there. that like all sorts of different. things right um that's true. yeah i think the main thing. is be comfortable in your own. skin right the second you're trying. something yeah or you know. what i mean like yeah be naturally. you as naturally you as you can possibly. be uh but yeah the the there's there's nothing worse. than living with regret uh and there's really a lot. of things that are way worse. than being rejected being rejected. is nothing it it really. is nothing especially if you get used. to it yeah it's nothing. yeah been rejected so much yeah me. yeah yeah me too yeah. yeah yeah yeah for sure. yeah it's it's hard. for everyone is there like a single one. thing that you could do every time. if you're like i don't know what to. say right oh yeah like 100 percent. let's say it's having your number. on a piece of paper. right yeah like you dropped this. yeah yeah which is stupid. right but it could work if you have nothing. else like maybe that's what i like to. do that's what i want i like to. do this you're at a cafe. and you go and you're going. to pay there's a hot. chicken line you go into. paint you go like this. you go like this uh yeah and then it's your turn you say i would like an american. oh oh [ __ ] dude and you just drop a bunch of [ __ ] cash so you go like this i'm [ __ ] my bad my bad my my bad my bad dude. i don't with some of this. yours and then be like it doesn't matter. to me go to. an atm before you go. yeah yeah you have to. get back and pretend you're fumbling. with your money make sure it's not. outside because it could blow away. yeah make sure it's not just like 36. dollars you got to. get like most of the money. in your account yeah. yeah yeah and then just right. when you're done go back. to the bank and put it all back. because you don't want to. carry that much cash because it's hard no i mean yeah i guess that's i guess that's possible. if the one thing if i just think it's tough to. to to have a once. so to speak onesizefitsall thing. that you do because i think that it. limits your your 14 stop i'm sorry. dude it limits your [ __ ] ability to. even get the result that you want. i think because it's like further narrowing the pass. for you to get through. yeah i remember one. time i remember one. time i was i would see this. girl at this coffee shop. and i would and she was so hot. i mean this was [ __ ] god when was this this was probably [ __ ] 13 years ago. and i was like we gotta hang out. sometime you know and she was like uh yeah. i don't know i have a boyfriend. i was like oh [ __ ] well when you guys gonna break up like just a [ __ ] idiot you know and then i would see her and then one time i was like she said she broke up and i was like oh let me get your number and she was like sure yeah fine here and she gave me her number and then i i wrote it i wrote or i wrote it down or put in my phone and then when i walked away i looked at the number because i was gonna text her something and i was like it was so obviously a fake number oh that i was like oh this girl actually just wants me to. not talk to her. yeah and i was like wow. and i just like i felt kind of bad. no you're not so bad you was. like eight one eight five. two five two five two five. two five two like literally but you don't have to. feel bad you just take that. inside and realize that she doesn't like me. but it's a [ __ ] i know no i felt bad. though because for the past. yeah yeah and like like it's so annoying. for for like that's just something. that's annoying that look it. sucks that guys have to. do this and hit on women. like to make them to. like to to. like to to. instigate yeah right yeah. mostly that's initiate a dude. thing right but like but like it's an it it. sucks that girls have to. deal with [ __ ] like it [ __ ] sucks that a girl if she just wants to. go have a brunch with her. friend she's got if she's hot. or even if she's not she's got to. deal with some dude. that's like oh my [ __ ] sister has that same jacket and you're like oh yeah you know what i mean yeah yeah it's so annoying dude yeah it's a little bit like being [ __ ] like it happens to. me like on the on the on the level. of people are like like i was at the coffee. bean and television. you know how i [ __ ] freak. with the coffee bean. tea leaf i do know. that and uh and uh this girl just immediately i'm sitting there. she's like crystalia and then everyone's just like and i'm just like you know. so it's like but to. be a [ __ ] it's good how you made it about yourself. well but bro you got to. bring your own experience to. the situation right but to. be a 10 bro to. be a 10 to. be a [ __ ] 10 like when you walk you're you know what i mean. like you're you know what i mean. you're right you're i don't like but your titties. move if you're a 10. and you're walking and your titties. are moving the opposite direction as you. bounce like this you're describing. jessica rabbit like you're just taking steps you're walking. into just somewhere just to. the dmv and all you want to. do is get your [ __ ] picture taken right. because your your license is uh expired and you don't even. know because you're a hot. chick and you have to. deal with that [ __ ] and you're walking and you're taking steps and as you take a down step your lumps. go up to the left. dude dudes are gonna be like hey my sister has that same jacket dude's. going to be like what the [ __ ] is wrong. with that woman that's not good. i'm just saying you're taking a [ __ ] step on. the downswing to. the bottom right and your titties. are [ __ ] activating to. the upper left some dude. is gonna be like my sister has that same. jacket it's annoying as [ __ ] for these tens okay but also non tens every woman. every woman deals with this. out in the [ __ ] world it's like it doesn't matter like a lot of men are afraid of like supremely beautiful women and they don't even get talked to. at all i know. dude i know i understand. that and that's another thing. that they have to. wear you got to. walk worry about this [ __ ] the other 10. there's a super duper 10 like in an almost eleven. and when she [ __ ] takes the down step to. the bottom oh my gosh go [ __ ] above. her shoulders do it and it's insane. and she's like why do no. guys ever talk to. me and [ __ ] are around her dude dude [ __ ] men can be [ __ ] too and they're just like i wish i could uh i want to. say that her uh my sister. has the same jacket but she's like i guess. i'll leave and a [ __ ] dude 10 is like i want to. tell her that my sister. has the same jacket and she spins. around and walks away. and [ __ ] takes the down step to. the bottom right and her titties go. up above to the upper. left and it's like dude. they're missing out they could be doing. the horizontal mambo they. could be splurting and a [ __ ] kid could come out. nine months later my take away. from that is that there are so many. sisters with the same jacket. so many sisters have the jacket that. this woman's wearing all. i'm saying is dude everybody. wants to find someone. right and that's actually not all you're saying and if you're a a chick that is taking steps and as your ticket. steps your titties are moving. in the opposite directions. dude go to the doctor go. straight to the [ __ ] doctor that's not true. bro when you see you know. what i'm talking about when you see. all right well what the [ __ ] are you talking about cartoons no like [ __ ] you know hefty breasted. women like when you i'm saying half. do you have to. six sack [music] [laughter]. oh i'm sweating [ __ ] this [ __ ] mouth mouth you know what i mean no dude all right dude no a lot of the time i don't know what's inside jimbo. okay dude my friend my friend when i was in high school. and he [ __ ] said and he was like oh man it was his chick. named stacey stacy you know no one real his name's stacy. what her name was stacy. dude and she [ __ ] and my buddy thought she was so hot wow. and he was like oh man. when she watched my jimbo. and i was like jim. and he said yeah dude. jugs in my mouth she can't even say it. hey [ __ ] jugs in my mouth. baby oh so there's two bees. two m's two m's yeah uh can't spell jacksonville baby. oh bro i never forget. we were on the [ __ ] we were walking. up the stairs bro he was so loud. i have a question. it was echoey because it was the stairwell. and he was like drugs in my mouth. baby i have a question. though did he make that up or is that something. no he made it up. bro wow that's so ludicrous. that's so ludicrous that you actually. can say that out loud. because what the [ __ ] no one knows jimbo yeah. that's how old is he like 15. 16. we were in high school. yeah so young yeah oh [ __ ] man he's 43. now you know he's always a year. older than me i'm only 42. he kind of looked like brad. pitt huh that guy. i mean oh so jealous. we all look like different. people you know i look like attractive. guys too it's just different. i'm more of a [ __ ] that guy from my best. friend's wedding the gay. guy okay so the thing about that. guy is it's worse to. live with regret than it. is to be rejected. okay next video wow also jimbo. emma hey chris how's it. going love the show. keep it up love what. you guys are doing love. tuning in so i'm just going. to cut straight to. the chase here i'm 22. i'm seeing a woman who's 44. and i keep running. into the same questions. so essentially people will ask. uh variants of is she a sugar. mama and she's not they'll. ask have she got any kids. and she hasn't and they'll ask is. it weird and it's not and there. are a few other questions. that are sprinkled in there. as well usually but keep running. into those over and over again. i was just wondering if you had any ways. to kind of give a shortcut answer and i also was wondering if you know she is twice. my age if you thought there were any maybe practical implications of our. situation in the future that. i should look out for or if you guys. have had any experience with this. yourselves so uh yeah that's my question. thanks for listening to. it and uh let me know what you think. a little bit well the practical thing. is she's going to. die way earlier way. earlier than you yeah he could get hit by a train or some [ __ ] though true so you never trained. in australia but but i think that that honestly. those questions then they'll never stop they will never stop you just gotta learn. to breathe through that annoying [ __ ] because that is not not gonna [ __ ] stop sugar mama just look him right in the eyes. and say no that's a [ __ ] rude. ass question anyway well the people are sure. they're funny they're idiots yeah they're idiots oh really you think that's a joke. do you think they're being fun. oh i think probably mostly people. it's probably like oh shoot. sugar mama that's i think mostly probably stupid. dude uh people are happy. though but um i i was 30. and i dated a 51. year old i yeah i uh have you yeah i mean. that what is it 21. years i don't think i've ever. that's a big that's exactly. like this guy yeah yeah yeah i i could i and i was funny. too because i invited. her out and she came out. i mean she was smoking. right like and she was like smoking. we were talking and she was like you. know um you know i'm a bit older. right and i was like yeah and i didn't really know how much older and then she told me. she was 51 and we hung out. a bunch of times she was she was awesome. and she's you know. i think that i think some i mean. it's cool you know depending on. how many trees are this. guy seems mature yeah. like yeah you know it's cool. and it can work but it depends on what. the long play is right. like i mean if you want to. have get married and have kids. it's probably not the move right. because we'd have to. do it pretty soon yeah. you got it yeah you got to. do something you might i mean you might yeah i actually the age. thing that way like young. men yeah older women i think is sort of like has like a weird cultural. thing the way people look at it. it's like a source of jokes. more than anything else and i think that if you're in a serious. relationship or you're really a lot. younger as the man and the woman. is much older i think you're kind of like in a weird. situation uh beyond the literal. unit of the two of you. like people view you yeah yeah yeah it's like such an anomaly it's almost like humorous yeah. yeah yeah yeah yeah so i feel i kind of feel. your pain but if it's a really. serious relationship you're going to. learn to breathe through. those questions because they're never going. to [ __ ] stop uh practical i don't know i don't i don't think i would give you any advice besides that. which is that if you really do think long term. that you you see it. working out with this woman. not that you should necessarily end. it though that's more on that. right yeah to. end it if she doesn't have if she sees. those things in her future. that's true because she's so much i mean. butting up much more with the future. than you are i mean. you're 20 [ __ ] two you're so young wow but if you're happy with this woman then [ __ ] everything else yeah true yeah this is hard to. come by and if you find a little piece of it. grab it and hold on to. it forever completely john lennon said. that but completely right. um yeah i think that maybe uh you know. also too if you want to. like you can like be with her. for a long time and then she gets old and then either she dies. and then you're like 40 or 50. and then you got a whole nother. life that you can just kind of live. so you're asking you have two lives basically. when you live when you when you date. someone older you live two lives. so you're asking him to. bake in her death to. his plans for the future. well you have to. not really i mean she's 44. she's not 64. she's young. she's still like and he'll be 44. yes. she will be and he'll be 44. that's right yeah and then she'll be 70. something and he'll be 50. something and then she'll die. and then he'll get to. live a whole nother. life with someone else. that's all i'm saying so you're saying he should plan. on that for the future. her dying yeah wow okay. well that's cold [ __ ] it's not cold it's just true. it's reality and you know. me dude i speak the real but i'm saying you're planning. for another relationship after her no you don't have to. hold his eyes but no but you don't [ __ ] do that you know you just say like you know in your own. head you're like all good. things come to an end and then after that there's another life where also there. could be another good thing. and then that will come to. an end eventually but that. would be when i die. how weird would it be for him. to be with this woman. until she's until she dies let's say in her mid 70s. whatever and then he's in his 50s and then he turns. around and dates someone who's like 30. right. that would be the weirdest right. shock going from a 70. something year old to. a 30 year old yeah i'm just thinking like that would be imagine like the generation. that's like two generations yeah. like the gap of that. going from gen x to. millennial yeah jesus that. would be insane that would be the wildest. [ __ ] ever anyway [ __ ] everybody [ __ ] them all for asking stupid questions but they're not gonna stop if you're in love with this woman keep it up keep it going whatever the age. difference is only as big a deal. as you as you as you make it. now everyone else makes it right. okay cool next one what's up. guys uh my name is milo i am. 24 years old from seattle. washington uh chris been following you since. the vine days true. baby love you matt. i gotta introduce you through. congratulations but always loved it. when you were on and uh been loving. the new pod how are you going. uh thanks milo predicament for you. so as you can see we don't got a lot. going on up here sure yeah uh i don't know if you can see the back. but it's on its way out. i think it started. like junior senior year. college wow uh friends have been giving me [ __ ] for it i catch flack it's just like i i think i'm ready just for it to. stop being a thing yeah you know. so i'm thinking about shaving. it completely you're gonna go ahead. looking for your advice. uh but one thing i do like having facial. hair yeah no chris i know. it's it's one of your a little bit. that much face hair can't be

you have no hair hair and your face hair. is like stubble like yeah. yeah that's okay yeah yeah but also like the guy has a good. head yeah he's got a girl. i mean so kylie. so there's only one piece of advice. and it's this full agassi you. go full andre agassi the end. and learn and learn tennis or what what. he could oh he went oh because he had big. hair and then had yeah. the big crazy [ __ ] hair that was probably a [ __ ] wig and we all know it and then he was like [ __ ] it all i'm going mr. clean so now it's not going. mr clean it's going for [ __ ] action but you're fortunate because he has a good head like if i went bald. yeah trouble but you got to. cut it dude you got to. cut it i mean what are you going. to do grow it. out you look a [ __ ] [ __ ] but he's basically there it's like that's not even a one yeah yeah that's not even a zero but it's like a [ __ ] like the shortest possible length of hair is what he's got on his head but also you could be like if if people are making fun of me just say to. them like oh yeah you ain't. got no hair you'd be like yeah dude. it's a good thing man. it's a good thing i don't have. hair man because if you'd if i did i'd take your

something. don't bother me that's what i was gonna say. if it was like a dramatic film or a dramatic. tv show and like the person you're with like likes. to talk through it. i would get that but more than that. i would say i would just say hey can we not. talk to it like i wouldn't. you have to. be alone no also but it's also silly. and like you want to. laugh with somebody don't you this. is hilarious it's serious. business for this guy well i uh i think at first. first and foremost i'd be like why yeah. why what the [ __ ] that's so weird. why and make him answer. and depending on what he says i guess. give him what he wants. because he's asking for it. but that's that's a [ __ ] weird thing i don't even know what the [ __ ] this is like it's good for you to. get more views yeah yeah. because kristen will like be like let's watch a tv. show and i'll be like [ __ ] yeah and i'll turn it on it'd be like a great one like boardwalk empire and we have [ __ ] three episodes in and i'll look over and she's just like either on tick tock or not in the room. anymore and then the next night. i'll be like let's watch episode. four and she's like nah. we did it last night. and then i'm like you got me. hooked on a [ __ ] show and now. i'm watching it alone. i got to watch [ __ ] the whole season. of boardwalk empire yeah alone. um and i don't like that and that's a good. i like watching [ __ ] alone. but i mean watching it. alone is fine if you start. it alone but if you started with somebody. you were like this was our thing. so i get it i get what she's saying. yeah so you have to. watch all my podcasts in order. otherwise it doesn't make sense. uh yeah i mean i i think it's just a really. weird request but if he insists if he insists on it and if he has a good reason which i don't know what that reason could be but if you ask and he gives you one i guess give him give him the space to. watch it alone but he's a [ __ ] weirdo start watching it with another guy he'll come around. well that's true start watching it. with another guy i spread the cult. and then [ __ ] by the way you look great in that hoodie. you can get that hoodie. at chrisleya dot com it

yeah i was at the laugh. factory last night and there was a guy. in the front row. with a [ __ ] cowboy hat on the on his knee just chilling like he's like a gentleman yeah it was gentlemanly yeah and he said where are you from and he said california okay next where where in california i mean. probably up north for sure. it gets way down south near the border. but it was white. it gets pretty rural in california. people think of it as like i know. i know i know coastal city. [ __ ] is no dude. and it's so republican too. if you get out there. and you don't even know. about it the most like the majority. of the space in california. yeah is covered by. red or republicans but way. more people uh obviously are right. cities and they're all [ __ ] liberal. as [ __ ] i already knew that. okay well telling the viewers in case. they don't know mmhmm. and listeners um yeah so anyway oh i got uh oh uh subscribe. to our clip's channel too. on lifeline oh okay cool just saying and then also i got some [ __ ] videos coming out. where i'm doing crowd work. so subscribe to okay. so drunk okay yeah do you want. to do another one. are we done uh we could do one. more right all right cool. what up matt and chris. the name sam fellow. new jerseyan chris you might recognize. me from king and this yeah i remember her. sorry i burned you uh i'm sorry. anyway i'm kind of sending this. in for two reasons one. being i never heard back from king. in this thing and it made me kind of sad. but why do i know. who she is and um basically i'm looking. for relationship advice somewhat on just dating. right now and encountering beta. males every time i find a guy. i like decently he's [ __ ] beta. as [ __ ] and i'm just kind of over. it like it's hard. to be i guess 25. and accomplished these days due to. society and [ __ ] inflation. but um yeah just kind of looking for some advice. on that still waiting for theo. to rescue me on. his eagle let me know what you guys. think hope to hear. back from you love the show. thanks oh cutie um i don't know. what i know what a beta. male is obviously but it's not. me that could that could mean. a lot of things no. i wonder what she means. she's running like she meets a guy. then gets to know. him a little bit better. and then like comes to. understand he's a beta that's what she's. saying i will say to. this woman if you keep running. into the same problem. yeah it might be worth it. to look within yeah. and i she seems like a sweetheart. and a [ __ ] cool chick but i'm just saying i don't know you maybe there's something you're doing to. attract these betas right. maybe there's something you're doing that. you're attracting these days or maybe you're too. alpha maybe you're too much. maybe you're the alpha maybe everybody's dealing with the fact. that you're the alpha yeah in which case. you need a real [ __ ] alpha dude. you need a guy who wears sunglasses. all the time at night. never has a shirt on. and just [ __ ] never or or maybe a tank. top at dinner but yeah he never has his shirt. on and um and just kind of [ __ ] you know i think that also you might want to. consider that the beta thing. might however you're defining it might be if you keep running. into it and like those are the guys that gravitate towards you i'm not saying that. you should give up your ideal and like not. keep looking but maybe for whatever. reason that's happening for like a if as a positive thing like maybe you are the alpha and in a relationship. or supposed to. be the alpha yeah and maybe you should actually try being the alpha in a relationship. and seeing what's up. with [ __ ] beta dudes. because i don't know it. keeps happening you might as well give it a shot. yeah they're they're out there. and everybody needs somebody but also every dude. is a beta really. because the alpha male is always out there. for everyone right like well that's not no. alpha and beta are. types though oh it's not. like it's not like actual like there's a dominator and everyone gets dominated. by that one guy well one i mean it's not a lot around. any alphas so yeah it is uh so it's you you're saying you're the dominator oh it is what it. is huh when i walk into. a room no it's just like a tower. i mean and it's like it's a general. type like uh alpha and beta and she's running. into what she seems she sees. as was she saying when she gets to. know them she realizes they're like what's going. on now i don't know maybe she's only meeting i don't. know if she's only meeting bettas. and she's not giving [ __ ] dudes enough. of a chance yeah i mean. yeah and then the problem does. lie within but right if you're somebody that figures out uh oh wait this guy's actually beta also the problem. was within yourself so basically the problem. is within yourself you're thinking too. much about it then you're either. not thinking enough about it. or thinking too much. about it you also could be pulling. the plug or judging these guys. too early yeah yeah yeah because every dude's a [ __ ] badass at something you know pretty much yeah uh and so maybe you just gotta give it more. time to find that. um and it could be now in your head. that it's gonna happen it's gonna happen. you're looking for it maybe ease. up a little bit and let the alpha [ __ ] come to. you the alpha that you're looking for however. you would define it or quism you. know what would you do. if four guys tried to. rob us there you go. right when you meet him quiz. him yeah and if a guy says oh [ __ ] i would run and leave you there right beta right. right if a guy says i'll kick all their [ __ ] asses right alpha but not the true. alpha right because you know what the true. officer says i don't know. what it what i don't care. i think the true alpha might say i do what i want. i would fight them but because they're four. of them i would probably lose. but i would i would rather. me get the brunt of the uh salt than you. that's probably what the the true. best possible alpha would say. he's he's realistic he's honest. but also would rather put himself. on the line physically to. get hurt than you for instead of you that's that's the right. thing right and that's what i would do. okay yeah well that's good. so we figured that. out okay so we figured that out for you. congratulations to uh everyone who we figured things out. for you know guys that was a good. episode of love lifeline. wasn't it that
