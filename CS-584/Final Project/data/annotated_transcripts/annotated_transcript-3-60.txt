you kidding me i was gonna wear this but it's too [ __ ] hot and crystallia dot com going over get that puff [ __ ] um so yeah man life's been good you know i've been hanging out my son made me smell a [ __ ] lemon this morning for you know about 25. times uh sons and daughters. they make you do so many [ __ ] things like that. so over and over again. he goes like this hey dadda. smell the yemen i put the yemen. in the trash can puts. it in his little trash. can that you we have a little trash. can that he plays with so much. it's just a trash can that. you're keeping like a [ __ ] like like a a bathroom. like right next to. it those those those trash cans suck. by the way like don't ever have a little trash. can you got to. take it out 900 times in one. day you throw [ __ ] a piece of kleenex away. and a capri sun. and you're like okay gotta take the trash. out and then he just he had it though. and he just he took a lemon. off the lemon tree. and for some reason kristin is convinced. it's a lime tree it. they're yellow and big and smell. like lemons and she's like you know. they're actually limes and i'm i just got to. be like like it's one of those [ __ ] arguments where you're just like yeah well but you know it's like literally pointing to. a duck and being like that's a will. you know it's a woolly mammoth if you'd like she'll be like if you just if we kept them. on the tree they turned into. limes and i'm just like oh oh you're just gonna be a crazy. person but they're so yellow. and when you squeeze them. and put them in a [ __ ] water. it's nice in the summer. and she's like yeah but if you just left. and i go oh oh that's as far. as i go with this. argument if you're gonna point at something and tell me it's something. it's not i'm done dude. i'm all done right. hey chris you what are you wearing. a tshirt no that's a sweater. really no this is a [ __ ] tshirt. no it's a sweater jumping out. the plane [ __ ] you know like all right. dude okay it's a lime. yay let's squeeze these yellow. limes in our drinks so calvin even calvin. is like it's a yemen. like he knows dude he says lemon. like it's a [ __ ] african country. it's a yemen he can't. say zel's it's so cute. yemen is a yemen smell. the yemen and i smell. it oh yeah and then he's like i put the yemen. in the tascam puts it in the trash. can and then picks it back. up smell the yemen again. and i'm like okay put the yemen. in the cash can put he starts saying cash can like it's a game show. and then picks it back. up put the smell the yemen. okay it's not the yemen. again i smelled it so many. times until i was like you know what maybe this is a lime. i have no [ __ ] idea i don't even smell. it anymore i got past. the point of like it. was like it was so lemony that i wanted. to like [ __ ] vomit and he's just like you smelled the yemen. again and i smelled it. 25 times and then he just took the yemen and he says the lemon and he says i throat. the yemen and through. it and he says i'll go. get it yeah this and goes and gets it. and then comes back then he threw it. 25 times and then it [ __ ] squirted open because it's a [ __ ] yemen dude and he's and he comes back and he's like it's all wet it's all yet it's yeah right here and i like we can't throw it anymore. you know [music] kristin's coming. down like oh does he have the lime. and i'm just like all right. okay yeah my life he's got to. pretend lemons or limes. um so anyway dude. it's beautiful though man. he's learning words and [ __ ] made me smell. a lemon so many. times it's it's it's amazing what fatherhood will. make you do you'll just be sitting there smelling a lemon. 900 times like you're in a [ __ ] like you're a mental patient. you know um yemen is in the middle. east i know guys i know. you know i just [ __ ] up and i said africa and whatever it's like it's not. if it's not in america. it's anywhere like i watched a [ __ ] serious and i know that's so [ __ ] narrowminded but i watched the thing on uh broadmoor the insane asylum. in [ __ ] i don't even know where i think it's in britain. because the guy was talking like he was britain. but he was also talking like he was scottish so i'm like it. could be an anarcho for all. i know it could be full. of [ __ ] penguins just crazy [ __ ] serial killer penguins i have no idea i think it's in europe but broadmoor and it's just this i was watching this documentary do it and it's insane man the way that britain uh broadmoor the way broadmoor was like made in like the 18th or i guess it would be the 17th century. it's 19th century 1800 something. and they were like so [ __ ] uh broadmoor was uh so like they used to. think like pyromaniacs were the most were the most dangerous people. like even more than serial. killers and [ __ ] and that they were the most criminally insane. and if you think about that. now that's insane but then if you think about it. back then you're like you know what dude. fire was [ __ ] probably out of control. back then like there's all this. [ __ ] fire retardant [ __ ] right. now 2022 if you light. a match in a building. you're gonna be fine even. if you light some papers on fire. the [ __ ] sprinklers are gonna come over and [ __ ] it's going to. be fine you get a fire. extinguisher shoot it out but in the 1800s. dude you light a match. it's a you're gone dude. first of all hay was. everywhere you know and like nobody knew anything. about anything fire retardant. so they were just walking around. all dry and [ __ ] and just lighting a flame would be so so pyromaniacs were like locked the [ __ ] up right i mean if you lit a match again in a day. after the first candle you. lit you were like you went away. for 25 years and uh and that made that was weird. to me and then i was like oh it probably makes sense. because everything because i do extra thinking right. i'm not the kind of guy that's like what. why i do extra thinking. so i was like well back. then they didn't have fire. retardant [ __ ] probably if you let you know what i mean if you lit a match you'd have to. be like say goodnight gracie. so so i was watching this. thing and it's crazy. what it's become like broadmoor became this thing. where they were very like if you were criminally. insane you would just get put in this. hospital it was a hospital. now that doesn't mean that it. wasn't like better than a prison. but apparently it was kind of better. than prison because they would like try and treat you and make sure that you were trying. to get better i mean. even still you were getting like extreme. and thrown at you because of other crazy. people in your [ __ ] ward like they had five people to. a room but like still like you would like try. to do i mean yeah. they did try to. do electro shock therapy. and all that stuff which made a lot. of people [ __ ] really i mean it worked a little bit and also didn't work it was a bad pr. move for [ __ ] for for mental. health let's put it that. way for for the world of psycho for the science. of psychology and [ __ ] it was a bad. pr move right. hey let's electrocute people's brains and have them. bite their tongues off and [ __ ] it seems very bad but apparently it worked a lot and then [ __ ] uh what's it called came along one flew over the cuckoo's nest came along and just [ __ ] that all up but i'm saying like you know some comatose people would come in and they wouldn't even know that who they were or where they were and then you shocked the [ __ ] out their brains and then they'd wake up and it'd be like oh [ __ ] time for some tea i'm like oh you know what tea is like i love tea i just couldn't ever say it right because i i didn't even know what i was doing i didn't know where i was i didn't know who i was but now it's like it's all good can i have some crumpets. and um and they're like oh wow. like why is everybody. throwing [ __ ] on me. this is this is absolutely mental. and they go out and they get like a job. dude you come in all like they just go. and you were just like oh hello. i'm a productive member. of society what am i doing. in here it's so clinical. oh you mentor and then they'd leave and they'd [ __ ] start a business you know what i mean oh well i need a 401k why is this [ __ ] on me [ __ ] it's all oh what's going on these keeps throwing [ __ ] this is not a way to. live and then chuck them. back and then throw you know. what i mean you can make people go. back and forth i like being cancelled. because i can say whatever. i want now and um but yeah so they did that. and then i watched that and a lot. of [ __ ] crazy people were in there and then it became like this sort of a guy and then it was like this. one dude [ __ ] i was just gonna say something good now i can't remember what it was but this one dude escaped broadmoor and just started killing people. like like dude talk about a [ __ ] up talk about a pr. like i'd love to. see a [ __ ] like uh an hbo max. series on this but like one guy escaped. broadmoor in like the early. 1900s and just immediately started killing. [ __ ] like it wasn't like it was like it was a zombie. like a [ __ ] fast one in uh what was that movie. with is brad pitt where they did. fast zombies is that one. where he's a fat is that. the one with their fast. i don't know whatever. the zombies are with their fast. they come out world war. z and he's just like yeah. i'm all good i'm all. good i won't kill. and everyone turns down the [ __ ] closing. cell block gunk closing cell block. dude and it was so long. ago that they didn't even. know like about how easy escaping. was and i was watching this. documentary and it was literally like and what he did. what how how he escaped was. he jumped on the roof. and jumped over and you're just like oh oh put a barbed wire. hey get guards but it was 1912. and we didn't know that they just wouldn't. leave the guards in there. themselves needed electric electro [ __ ] therapy just letting people leave watching him go just like probably fine shock those [ __ ] got him [music] and the dude just left and he was like goodnight everybody and then left and then hopped over and then immediately just started killing [ __ ] and it ripped through the headlines and now broadmoor is like this [ __ ] has got talk about bad pr they're shocking people's brains and [ __ ] are leaving just killing. everybody immediately and now broadmoor is like back. to this [ __ ] people think it's this prison now it's just [ __ ] up dude it's weird to. think about these people though. how they grew up. like dude you think people it's weird. to think about like uh these people who have. deep issues like it's it's so weird. to think about like of course doing. what you do is your fault. if it's [ __ ] horrible but also like god damn dude if it's a mental disorder then what right luck of the draw you were just born [ __ ] up and then your mom like threw you down some stairs. or whatever the [ __ ] it was i don't know but yemen's in the middle east and i knew and i know that so um so yeah i watched that thing on broadmoor i don't remember where i was going with that but it doesn't matter dude all it was all all i know honestly is sometimes i get sad i got sad remember on the way to. the haha i was talking about that. and then i got [ __ ] s i was at this what was i [ __ ] waiting for i was waiting for something i was in beverly hills and i was waiting for something to. get done and i was by. myself i was waiting for something i can't remember but i stopped in this. cafe oh yeah cause i got to. get sinus surgery i. told you that so i had to. go [ __ ] get a a checkup on that make sure that i don't know man they just milk. you for money you know. they're like come back we'll check. on your nose and you're like okay. you're like 300 bucks you're like okay. is it okay no yeah. we're stopping the surgery oh okay. and then um i'm waiting because i got there early. i thought it was going. to take longer and i'm waiting. i got the earlier i pop. in a [ __ ] cafe you know because i that's how i do it and i pop in a cafe and i and i go to. order you know i get the four shots. over over espresso right. or four shots over ice. sorry four shots over espresso eight. shots and um and i go in and i [ __ ] order. it dude and i [ __ ] turn around first of all beverly hills is out. of control okay beverly hills. is out of control. before i went into. the thing there was a hit and run. before i went into. the cafe there's just like uh i just hear like a bunch of women. oh no oh oh oh oh no oh oh where did he go. and i'm just like what the [ __ ] where did he go oh and then i see another woman. walking back with her phone. quickly and she's like i got him. i got i got the plate. i got it and i'm just like what. oh my god oh she oh she got it. oh she got it lisa got it. what was it he just [ __ ] mumps him. up and i and i this is how beverly you think that's beverly hills. all the women coming together. trying to band together. finding a [ __ ] hit and run and i look and some guys side mirrors off and uh this is the most beverly hills it does so much commotion so i [ __ ] look at somebody in the uh what do you call it the um the patio of the cafe i'm about to. walk into. and i say what happened. was there a hit and run. dude this is what the [ __ ] lady does to. me she's eating with her. friend she literally goes like this. and i'm like okay so [ __ ] rude. you know like just say yeah. yeah i guess so i don't know she just looked at me. like and i'm just like be a person. though and like it's fine. it would be fine. if i never saw her ever. be a person but she was eating. with a friend just like yeah and so this. and that and nancy. and them and then and then that happened. and i'm just like oh i'm a piece. of [ __ ] so i'm going to. get the cafe and like all this. crazy wacky [ __ ] was happening and then um i ordered the [ __ ] four shots and then i turn around and i look at this painting this painting of like i don't know maybe it's italy but these like children. are playing in this. courtyard and like this house is you know. looks like it was made in [ __ ] 1700s or some [ __ ] and i'm watching this. painting and i'm looking at the kids. and the parents playing and i'm just like i literally am thinking. nothing other than wow. that looks beautiful like that. looks i'm not even thinking you. know how like sometimes you don't even. think words you're i mean. sometimes you think words right like somebody. will bump in here and you'll actually think the words. like [ __ ] that [ __ ] like i guess you do that for you you don't have to. think words but you literally think for you. like wow what a piece. of [ __ ] you think those words like that. red balls bouncing across it. like you're watching the [ __ ] sesame street when they're singing along. and like and you're like uh and it just bounces. across [ __ ] these [ __ ] and um and sometimes you don't but i wasn't thinking even words. right like sometimes you get lost. in a beautiful [ __ ] land. in your mind and i'm looking at this. painting and i'm just like half. thinking these words like wow. that seems beautiful but it's more. like oh wow like you know. what i mean i'm just feeling the words. does it even make sense. you know it just felt nice. to get locked into that. picture and then i start. thinking actual words like i should just like [ __ ] what if i lived there i literally just thought what. if i lived there what if i just grabbed calvin. grabbed my fiancee grabbed my you. know some of my friends. that want to. go probably none of them. but i could suggest it to. them you know i could throw out. an evite hay move. into this spot in italy. you want to. come be away from everything. get off of social media. or maybe just be on it. but be on it. just like and just be private. on it and just have [ __ ] italians follow you and [ __ ] and just follow some other italians maybe follow one or two other people that i knew from back. in l.a or even new jersey. when i was growing. up but that's it. you know maybe my roommate. in [ __ ] when i went to. nyu for eight months maybe follow him. but that's it right. and then all of a sudden just my my feed. would be italian and [ __ ] i'm just thinking about this. [ __ ] you know i'm just getting lost in this painting like lost in this painting like it's a bad movie you know you ever see a bad [ __ ] independent movie where a guy's like going through some [ __ ] or even better. a woman she's going. through some [ __ ] and then she just looks at a painting or looks at her reflection in a [ __ ] side in the side of a building the mirror and she just like gets lost in it or even worse the scene where the guy is in the bar and he's dealing with issues and he goes into. the bar and [ __ ] turns on the water. and and pushes it. up into his face. and he's [ __ ] like rinsing off. his face like have you ever done. that like that's the [ __ ] most not the thing that's the most. symbolic only in movies thing ever. that ever happened but i'm doing a version. of that i'm getting lost in this.

[ __ ] trimmer right because i trim. i always trim the cleaning. ladies come and they leave and then i trim. and kristen's like you always do it. on the [ __ ] cleaning lady and i'm like you're right. i do i really have a [ __ ] that's so shitty i do that. you know i don't know what it. is i think it's because i want to. shave on a [ __ ] i want to. trim on a clean. area you know i think maybe subconsciously that's what it. is but i'm being a real piece of [ __ ] sometimes i make her sound like why are you doing she's not like that she's the sweetest angel in the world but like that's just for comedic i guess. or in my head in memory that's how i want to. think about it because i don't want to. be wrong [laughter] but um so i got one. and then it fell and then it broke. and i had to get it. again dude i don't even know how many shavers. i've [ __ ] bought in my life. but i got it again. and then i [ __ ] you know i keep it nice and i mean and i keep it nice and i just did it and i'm like [ __ ] yeah dude i keep it nice and i'm not breaking this one and i'm keeping it clean dude. right like i'm not the kind of guy. who [ __ ] uses the liquid to. clean the shaver like what a piece. of [ __ ] but like i'm the kind of guy that like tucks it. away and wraps it up. a little bit and puts. it in the [ __ ] thing right. and i'm playing with calvin and then you know. how sometimes you hear sounds. that are not for the area. that you hear that you're in. right like here's the greatest. example right if you're in an ikea. and all of a sudden you hear a bear growl. immediately everyone goes what the [ __ ] is that but then sometimes you hear sounds uh that you might hear close to. the area you're in and they're happening. for a bit and they don't shock. you because it's a familiar sound in an area. where you might be close. to and you don't realize the sound's happening. until later because you're like wait a minute i know that sound and it sounds familiar but why is it in this area. like if you're in a flower. shop and you hear a truck. backing up but it's too loud. and too close. you'll might let that fly. for like 20 seconds and be like oh wait. a minute where is this. [ __ ] thing and then you open the back. door and it's literally right. outside you're like okay i thought that. was weird right so i'm playing with calvin and i realize i've been listening to. my shaver going off for like a minute. and i i try to. like check i'm like does. this been going on how long has this been going. on i can't ask calvin. right because he's just like will you smell. de la men smell. the yemen smell the yemen. again i fro the yemen. yeah it does i put the yemen. in the tashkan and i'm just like you know. okay but i'm listening to. this [music] and i'm like but that is happening. i guess but i'm in the living. room but like the room next. to me is the tv room. and that's my shaver i think but like who's shaving. in either the living room. or the tv room nobody because the hair would be getting. all the right so i say kevin give me one. second uh let's take a break. from selling this yemen uh i have to. walk over and see and i look and this is not a joke. this is real life. you might be like oh but it's a joke. and you're a comedian and the reason. you might think that is because it's a ridiculous. thing to be having happening. but it's real this is a documentary. if cameras were around this. would be in a dramatic documentary. kristin is shaving the. couch the sentence i said. was the sentence i meant. to say kristen is shaving. the couch you know that. thing family sit on she's shaving. it [music] and i look at anyone. but the only other person is there. is calvin and he's smelling the yemen. so i'm like okay never mind. and she looks up to. me and she says i'm shaving. the couch and i say what. what and she says it's a really. good idea and i say what. and she says it's really working and i say what are you. using my shaver on the couch. for and she says look and she points. and the part she was shaving. looked a lot cleaner. than the part she wasn't shaving. and i said what's on there. and she said there's dog. hairs on here that we don't even. realize [laughter] and i'm like okay. so this is how you're getting the she's like yeah. i tried doing it with the scissors. and tape and this is just much better. and i'm like looking at her. shaving the couch i'm looking back. at calvin smelling a lemon. 900 times and i'm just like oh i'm in broadmoor. oh oh oh i'm a nurse. in broadmoor because everyone hears crazy but me and i have to. deal with it just mean shaving. a couch i i throw the yemen. yeah like this it's yet. i throw the yemen yeah. like this i put the yemen. in the taschen dada smell. the yemen and she's just shaving. it it's a lime. just oh everyone okay all right. and i thought i was the crazy. one the day in the life. my babies a day. and a lot a day. in a life i know. right a day in a [ __ ] life um so i don't know what the [ __ ] to. do anymore what i do. know is i'm not going to. see [ __ ] uh top gun in the movie i'm gonna wait till i come streaming and then i'm gonna watch it. and streaming everyone's gonna be like dude. you have to. see it in the theater. that's why i got the 97 if everyone saw it. at home it would be [ __ ] more like 82 percent. as well a days huh. let's watch this here where the [ __ ] did it. go i handed you a [ __ ] dear man let's not watch that what's this actually oh bro have you guys seen um [music] look at [ __ ] instagram dot com dj khaled what's up with this god did thing so dumb you know oops i put jd khaled wow jd khaled just some [ __ ] white lawyer hi i'm j.d khalid jd khaled attorney at law um god did that stupid thing that dj khaled it's all for the [ __ ] it's got to. be all for the and i can't play it. yes dude can't play it because i'm not signed. in don't know my [ __ ] thing yeah yes dude let's go to.
