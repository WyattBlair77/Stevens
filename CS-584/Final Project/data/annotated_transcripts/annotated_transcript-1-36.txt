love family guy here's season two through four and then 20 and you're like what about the middle [ __ ] and they're like nah i don't know why they obviously have a deal with the [ __ ] if you have a deal with it just at least consecutively have the you know it's like on a plane when you're like oh what do they have you ever click on tv shows when you're in a plane and you go to. click tv shows and you look in the in the in the catalog. and it's like oh they got the c. word with laura lin what was. it on showtime or some [ __ ] oh let's start watching that that might i think that was actually critically acclaimed and it's like season. 2 episode 4 and season. 2 episode 5 season. 2 episode 6 that's what. they have on the plane. like you're some [ __ ] that's just going to. in the mid you're like you're just going. to be sitting upright eating peanuts. never having watched the seaword before. just picking oh yeah okay. i'll watch the seaword i i watch the l. l did they make a show. called the l word. too what the [ __ ] man. just say the whole word. in the thing the c. word and the l word. just call the show cancer. call the show lesbians that's so we know what it. is but yeah i'm i'm on the plane. dude right and i'm gonna watch [ __ ] uh uh what's the show with the [ __ ] who cares you know what i'm saying airplanes. have odd episodes of tv shows if you go into. the catalog of stuff they never have starting. with the pilot no i know. supernatural i know i started started watching. supernatural but i started watching on netflix. and i'm like dude this show. is a perfect show to. watch on the plane why. because it's bad but i like it that's the best. plane watching shows bad but you like it. like you don't [ __ ] turn on you know uh killers of the flower. moon on a plane you want. to watch it an imac. the biggest screen poss although i'm not one. of those guys that's like nah you got to. go see it in the theater. right you got to. see it on a big. the bigger the screen. the better like there are guys. like that try to. you know go to. the one in [ __ ] there's one in a hollywood. where you you can go and there's it's 70,000. feet up and 150 million feet. across it's a it's called. ch cinema it's so wide. and it doesn't go up. that high it's the chad. multiplex over in burbank dude. yeah it's [ __ ] awesome dude. the scre yeah you know. i get that name right. why cuz the screen. looks like a chad you. know what a chad is. yeah yeah it's a penis. that's wider than it is tall. it's like a can of tuna anyway. um okay so go to. the chad multiplex to. go see killers of fl yeah. dude we oh man. i was with dan. last night we went. to go see uh killers of flower. mood at uh the ch. multiplex man oh [ __ ] it was awesome dude that screen was so wide anyway um i uh i thought about making a movie actually i'm gonna get the supernatural but i thought about making a movie where someone's possessed and and there's like an exorcism but like it's like real it's not like the [ __ ] i think a good movie would be if you didn't know if the person was actually had a demon in them or if they were a crazy person and and he gets an exorcism and he thinks he's better. he either thinks he's better. or he's better and you don't know. the whole time even at the end. of the movie you're like like it. sparks debate you're like were they. do you think that there. was a demon in him. was it a horror movie. or was it is a movie. about mental issues i don't make that movie dude. and they get an exorcist. and the exorcist is like pretty. lack lack a days of go. and [ __ ] anyway i'm getting off topic but my uh supernatural. it's a bad show and here's the thing. i i didn't want to. tell enrique or lulu that i was. going to watch it. because they were going to. make me mad the way. that they were going to. say that it was a good. show and i know that about my friend. friends i know my friends. do you know why i know my friends. cuz i know my enemies. and your friends are your enemies. okay your friend shouldn't be that. close like mike tyson said. a man who is a friend. to everyone is an enemy. to himself right i don't know. if i believe that but that sounds [ __ ] dope. so i wasn't going. to tell them that i was watching supernatural. cuz i didn't want lulu to. be like oh that's one. of my top five favorite. shows and i didn't want enrique. to be like oh it's badass. cuz it's a bad show and i wanted to. keep that to. my chest i wanted to. keep that in here you understand. i wanted to keep it. right here i wanted. to be close. to the chest i wanted to. be i wanted to. watch supernatural know it was bad and like it on my doo dude it was not a sharing show what'd he do. though what did he do. though first [ __ ] chance he got he says you know what i'm watching [ __ ] dude he betrays himself a man that is friendly to. everyone is an enemy. to himself that's what i did. right there i was being way. too friendly to. my friends and i was an enemy. to myself and now i can't roll. on my doo and keep it close. to the chest about how i like to. watch supernatural because it's bad and i like it does any of this make [ __ ] sense dude yes if you don't get it then i don't want you a part of this cult jared letto out there climbing the empire state building dude chill bro i'll get to. that later dude he even start. at the bottom and go all the way. at the top he did. 18 floors in the middle you [ __ ] what i'll get to. it but my point. is i told him and i betrayed. myself i told him i was watching superal and sure enough. and r goes oh. it's badass and i said no. but you know it's a bad. show right and he says no. way it's [ __ ] awesome dude there's 15 seasons obviously it's awesome. and i was like you can like it. but it's bad he's like how about sam though. i'm like dude sam's the. worst character you like dean. he said i said i guess. i don't be knowing the names. of characters in tv shows. also by the way until it's like season. 4 and then lulu came along and enrique yo he watches. supernatural she goes that's one of my top. five favorite shows of all. time and i said to. watch because you like it but you know it's bad. right and she says get the [ __ ] out of here. dude i how am i supposed. to sit with [ __ ] that are going to. like think that it's a whatever. dude it doesn't matter. the show's bad i like watching. it it's you know there's not enough. colors in it it's dark. and [ __ ] and green and brown but anyway picture me like that so i digress. i'm watching it on the plane. i download it on my phone. having a good time the thing. about jared letto is. and i know you're with me. everyone's going to be like wow. right we have to. remember something dude just because something looks wow. doesn't mean it is wow. there's no such thing as magic. right there's trickery that's all there. is there's trickery also climbing. the empire state building is illegal. period unless you ask beforehand. and pay people and you're famous. that's some rich guy [ __ ] i am not down. with that [ __ ] i am not down. he climbed 18 floors. in the middle of the [ __ ] no look i'm not saying it's not hard okay i'm not saying it's not hard it is hard. but just cuz something is hard. doesn't mean it's good. or cool okay or worth doing. case in point break. dancing that's hard you think i could do. this [ __ ] i can't do itar i can feel you i can't you know what i'm talking about whatever. that song is here hold. my jacket it's a disrespectful. but um it's not cool to. do break dancing i don't care. right i don't care how baggy your clothes. are or how many [ __ ] kobe bryant jerseys. you have you know what i'm talking. about you look stupid. it looks cool to. some people but to. me you're just somebody who's dressed in way. too comfortable clothes and a backwards. hat and i can't tell if you're a man. or a woman right. um so uh yeah what the [ __ ] was i saying about jared leto. so the dude we don't say. his name though here at this. podcast we actually don't so i'm saying it. right i'm say i said it. but i don't i don't say. his name but you know. i'm talking about the guy who climbed. the empire put j but we don't say. his name right. so he climbed up. 18 floors of the empire. state building everyone was like whoa look what he's doing dude. first of all he was strapped in and i'm not saying it's still not impressive. or [ __ ] whatever it's still hard dud. don't do that you're a rich. guy and you don't you don't just climb. 18 stories you got to. climb the whole thing otherwise that. ain't [ __ ] i don't give a [ __ ] all right period. and honestly if i'm being completely honest. i'm not going to. talk about it anymore. but i will say oh dude.
