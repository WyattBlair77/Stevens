[ __ ] it you got my car you know what i just you got my card that's what the the response. is for that i'm not getting. a boat you know. you know where we should oh. dude we just got gotta drive through. a nice neighborhood you know. what it wouldn't be half. bad liv you know. what what why don't you do. you everybody would you ever move. to the marina we're building. a house in [ __ ] the san fernando va yeah but we could say you know what if we sell the lot. and we're already doing it. dude we paid the [ __ ] deposit you know what i mean. files done for no. reason didn't know what it was had to. look at it so yeah. dude i told this. story on lifeline and i'm going. to tell it my way. too so my brother. doesn't interrupt me he doesn't interrupt me. he's great but i'm just going. to tell my version of it. do it because some of you don't listen. to the lifeline if you listen. to lifeline you got to. listen to life if you don't listen. to lifeline you got to. listen to lifeline it's my new. podcast with my brother and we take advice. and we take questions. and we give advice to. it and it and it rips. it's just great it's already. bonkers crazy it's going. [ __ ] dummy viral so it's all good man. you know and that's not my fault. dude if the people want to. watch it they want to. watch it and i don't want to. be like a dick. but you're welcome but also thank you. right it's a symbiotic relationship. i get into the [ __ ] i'm going. to lifeline and i'm like you know what have i called. the producer i was like yo. can you please order me. one of those burritos from that. banging place i can't do it. because you know postmates you. can order from another place. on postmates but it's always more difficult. because they're like are you actually. at this place or you're far. away like you're an idiot you're like just [ __ ] send it where i'm guessing all right at least make it on me don't it's just so i'm like can you just ha just can i get can you get the thing get the vegan burrito. and your boy eats meat. i don't want you to. think i'm some woke [ __ ] i don't want you to. think i'm some guy that's quote unquote. in tune with his body. and spiritual i'm not dude. as a matter of fact. i don't even have a spirit. okay so uh they're like uh i'm like can you just get me. the vegan burrito and the only reason. is because it's good. and i don't want to. have something heavy before. i bang it out on all. cylinders on lifeline okay. it's also on this channel. subscribe to the channel. by the way we love you. subscribe to the channel. click that [ __ ] right now thank you i love you but i get to. [ __ ] lifeline and uh uh you know he orders it he goes yo. gotcha burrito will be here get there. to the building as soon as i get to. the building guy shows up with a postmates. bag [ __ ] yeah dude johnny. great timing okay i walk in is the bag. i judge the size of the bag. i know i only got one burrito. and nobody else got anything because i'm on a group. text and everyone said nay now. i look it's a [ __ ] size of a burrito. my baby so i'm happy. dude johnny great timing. so we get into. the elevator and sure enough what button does. the guy hit well the guy with the burrito. hits the same button that i'm going. to hit because he's going. to the same floor. i'm going to go. because that's my burrito. he's holding but i have options. here right i could either say yo. i think that's my order. and have him be like okay. and then wait till we both. get to the door so. i prove it to. him because obviously i'm not just so. i'm not just wack job. in an elevator and then he hands me. the burrito as i walk into. my my the door that we're both. going to or i could. not say anything which is a little bit weird. because it'll seem like i'm following. him until we get to. the door and then i have to. be like hey that's my burrito. and also it makes me seem not. observant now i don't want either. of those things i don't like awkwardness. and it takes a lot. for making me to. feel awkward dude i've stood on a stage. bombing in front of hundreds of people. okay i can handle. being in an awkward elevator ride. as a matter of fact. has there ever been an elevator ride. that isn't awkward i got this. but i don't want him to. feel like i'm not perceptive or observant. so he hits the floor. boom doors we're trapped. and i choose to. say ah is that the burrito. and he says yup. and i say it's mine. and he goes we go. up high of course we go. up high we go. up real high because we're at the top. of the floor because we're no [ __ ] dude we don't have a studio. ground level we've got a studio. above the clouds and the reason. is because we're not a bunch of [ __ ] okay we swallow hard and we move forward pause. we swallow hard pause. we swallow hard and the only direction we look. is up pause we take copious loads. in our throats and say thanks. dude pause we suck. large amounts of [ __ ] they get off. in our mouths and then we turn around. and they take turns. on our anus paws. okay then we hold. hands and we watch america's. sweethearts pause but that's the kind of [ __ ] gangsters. we are right now i don't even know at the beginning. of that [ __ ] run what the hell i was talking about but that's all so that's what happened. so we so he so he chuckles. you know because we're both in the same. elevator he's got the postmates for me. and a [ __ ] upsy daisy dude. it comes to a screeching. halt oh he's got gucci shoes. on what the [ __ ] this doesn't add up. the profile of this guy. it doesn't add up cause who's. uber eats in or postmates. in and some gucci flip. flops maybe somebody but that guy. has bad priorities and fine. but that's what i judge this. guy is but i used my mind. and my intuition to. think something's up right. like if that guy all of a sudden. beat the [ __ ] out of me. i'd be like should have known. had some postmates with the gucci. flipflops on that's on me. trust her intuition so we get out. of the elevator boom on the same. floor we walk down the hallway. to where it splits. i go one way he goes the other way. now that's okay and let me tell you why. because this guy doesn't even. know this building he's my postmates. guy but then i'm like i'm hearkening back. to the days where i asked. this dude in the elevator is that the burrito. he replied yes and then i said that's mine. so he knows he should follow. me why did he split off so i'm looking over. my shoulder like i'm batman. i'm looking over my shoulder. like i'm in a comic book. or a movie made by [ __ ] you know zack snyder. which i'm i'm not i'm absolutely not. in a movie name made by zack. snyder but if somebody were to. tap on his shoulder i'm the dude that looks behind like this. you ever see in movies. when a [ __ ] jackass gets touched on the shoulder. they always look at the hand. first and then at the guy that's by the way. the most asinine and dangerous. way to look at somebody. who just [ __ ] basically assaulted. you from behind if you look at the oh. he looked i was going. to look at the [ __ ] thing shanking his eyeballs. glug glugging out shank in his throat. [ __ ] glue glugging out right sorry dude you looked at the hand. not my face you could have defended yourself. but now you're glug glugging. out you're busting off. like a sprinkler on the side. of your neck excuse me are you. a ventriloquist so anyway. dude he splits off. and i'm like alright maybe he didn't hear. me or whatever but then he gets into. another apartment and that's when your boy. realized oh [ __ ] this sucks. i was wrong he lives. here and he was carrying his own. food into his apartment. and we just had the moment. that i wanted to. not make awkward turned into. a very awkward moment. and your boy felt it. because i looked at a dude. pointed to his food. that he just picked up in a small. confined space and said hey bud that's mine. hey hey man what. kind of [ __ ] lunatic does. that and i'm proud of myself. dude i'm honestly proud of myself. because i did something so cool. and so insane and i didn't even know it. and my life's the same. so what i'm trying to. get at is i'm gonna do more [ __ ] like that i'm gonna do more [ __ ] like that [ __ ] it why not why not walk into. an elevate a lot. of people learn from their mistakes. well let me tell you what i learned. during this mistake i'm just gonna say. whatever the [ __ ] i want to. anyone because it doesn't matter. he just laughed what a [ __ ] he is huh. and his gucci flipflops. why didn't he say. what do you mean. dude if i was in an elevator and i had my food. that i just picked up and some dude. looks at me and says is that. a burrito by the way it probably. wasn't a burrito. it could have been anything. maybe it was because he said yes and i and then the guy said that's mine. i'd say what do you mean. hey buddy help me. clear this situation up how about oh we bugs. bunny and yosemite sam because we're some looney tunes. now and i wasn't even. on [ __ ] vyvance and then i waited for a little bit longer. and the [ __ ] producer was like i don't know what's up. here bruto it's taking a long. time and then i told him. the story and then i said it. again on lifeline and that's the third. that's the fourth time i told it. because i also told it. to my family hey yes he is john he tells the same. story too much dude but that's what comedians do. and that's how when they realize maybe i should say. it on stage and now i probably won't because i said it. on two pockets yes dude people will think they're ripped. off if they come see me live dude. i actually heard that stuff on. my podcast on the podcast. whatever man don't push me you can get don't push. me merch at crystallia dot com. what's up dude your boy's changing. your boy's living your boy's growing. he doesn't stop the second you think you got life. figured out that's when the cookie [ __ ] explodes. that's not a saying i didn't want. to say that's when the cookie crumbles. i should have said that's when the cookie. crumbles but you know me. and if you know me. and if you listen. to every episode of this. podcast or other podcast you know i haven't had taco bell. since i was what 19. that's 23 years i haven't. had taco bell in 23. years 23 years. you might be like well why. don't you just say 25. why don't you just say. 20. and i would reply because i know. it's been 23 years. and then you'd be like why and then i say because i remember when i vowed never to. eat taco bell ever. again and then you might say well. how do you know. exactly when that was but then i would specifically say i was 19. because that's when i was at nyu standing outside. of a taco bell that. i just ate and i thought you know. what that wasn't that good. i'm never gonna eat this. again and i'm gonna remember this. moment for the rest of my life what a [ __ ] lunatic. dude but i did it. and i [ __ ] stuck to. it and i didn't realize that that was my ocd. in effect until a decade. and a half later dude. [music] he's got problems ocd anxiety. dark thoughts sometimes when it gets real bad suicidal ideation sometimes when it really gets real bad. suicide it's all good not lately. your boy grows he. doesn't eat taco bell. and he hasn't done it. in 20. now i haven't eaten burger. king in 15 years except for one. time they wanted to. pay me some [ __ ] racks to. do a commercial for him. and you know your boy. doesn't say no to. bags so he went back. on his ocd swallowed the anxiety. swallowed the big mac and carried. some bags home okay. one fire shaking his head. but you know it's true. it was a whopper. not a big mac because that's see that. just goes to. show you that i don't really eat that. much fast food unless it comes. to [ __ ] in and out he shaked his head because he shook his head because it's not a big map it's a big mac it's a whopper but i ate it dude and i thought i wasn't gonna like it but then i put it in there and i realized that [ __ ] is chemically engineered to make you like it and i liked it and i ha so i had one burger one whopper in between the [ __ ] dude this podcast is the most interesting podcast if you're a part of this [ __ ] [ __ ] and you're gripped you're on the edge of your seat or you're listening to your cubicle or you're driving you're progressing you're listening to me first of all you're a cuck if you're in a prius but we love cucks anyway dude we love them all man i love you no matter what you're driving dude yeah you're in a prius and you like to watch your guy you like to watch your wife get [ __ ] by other guys and maybe you're on your way to go watch your uh your friend [ __ ] your wife whatever it is dude you're listening to me you're on the edge of the seat you're listening about my burger king stories and you are with us dude this is basically the virtual tall grass outside of the log cabin and you're wearing your white and we're sharing our ideas and it's my turn but uh yeah dude burger king man took it ate it and it's all good now i haven't had taco bell in 23 years and of course that's my ocd a little bit activated but i still haven't done it and life's going fine without the [ __ ] gordita so i didn't get the gordita but i was hanging out with a couple here we were at my house hanging out with a couple dude couples by the way i love the dude and the couple and she loves the chicken the couple so holy [ __ ] [ __ ] is that heaven have you ever met a couple that you hang out with and you both like them both equally the same dude you gotta i mean what the [ __ ] man you lucked out the other person always suck imagine being the [ __ ] fourth person that sucks in a [ __ ] two two couples right you don't even know you're that guy you don't even know you're that guy yeah but i [ __ ] i don't really i really don't like dave. honey yeah but or she's like yeah but your friend he's just like he's a mooch and you're like yeah but he's [ __ ] big my heart he's usually the dude you know yeah he's been my homie for a long time so they came over we had a blast dude we had a blast we had a good time we're watching [ __ ] shows by the way we watched the staircase we watched the staircase dude we tried to. watch it with colin firth and you know colin ferch what what's colin firth what is he from he's from the [ __ ] uh uh uh the [ __ ] political stutter. or whatever the [ __ ] that show's called king speech only person. who could do the [ __ ] king speech role. better than him is me i guarantee. it dude you put me in front of the [ __ ] light just waited on baited breath. about what i'm gonna [ __ ] say but i can't get it. out because of a condition so anyway so i get to. the [ __ ] so we get we're watching hbo max. you know it's a good streaming. service i watch hbo. max and it's got the staircase. and i like colin firth and i like francis mcdormand. dude or whatever no. not her i always mix her up with tony collette. they're the same person pretty much. whatever is that sexist i. don't know dude colin firth is the same. person as my dad when he was 50. so it's fine. but colin firth is in this. [ __ ] he's one of those dudes he's played an american. it's it takes pla. it takes place in [ __ ] uh uh durham carol north carolina. it's a real story about now. i'll get back to. the taco bell stuff. but you know how i go this. is my [ __ ] is like it's all splintered and [ __ ] i tell a story i start telling the story and i tell uh offshore an offshoot of it i got this is an octopus story right we start at the beak and then all of a sudden he's using the tentacle to. to color the story and he'll get back. to it at the end. we'll get back to the beak. but right now we started a taco bell. and we're talking about this. we're talking about a murder or maybe. not even a murder we don't. know the jury's cut well the jury. was in and then it was out. and then he took a [ __ ] alpha play and it's all he's out of jail now but whatever dude it's a show about a guy who maybe threw his wife down the stairs. we don't know or bludgeoned her. and then put it over. at the stairs and then she was [ __ ] dead. and they put him away. for 15 years and then decided to. wait there's new evidence and then [ __ ] took him out of jail and he's like i never did it but also two of his wives. fell down the stairs. so it's like okay though. hmm when they figured that out right. so uh i'm watching the staircase. and colin firth is acting it up. he's one of those dude. that's a fantastic actor but no matter what he does. he's british dude you know. he's just too british. if you're that tall and that lanky you're just british. you know if you're an old guy. and you're just any they have you know. he's got glasses on. because the real guy's got glasses. but also it makes you look more british. if you're that tall and lanky and you got glasses. and he's just like so proper. spoken and it's not even how he's doing his accents. good but behind his accent. is always like oh he's british. though he's got a british. feeling but he's doing his best. and i think he's doing a great. job and he's probably going to. get nominated for an emmy because nobody gives a [ __ ] about anything and he's british. and they give emmys to. so many brits although he is. white so maybe he won't get an emmy because people are really pushing. that whole [ __ ] you know so i'm watching the staircase. and it's it's good but it's one. of those shows that you're sitting and you're watching and then you're like wait. a second there's a documentary about this. isn't it five and six of us. are watching it the couple. and my uh assistant and then another no it was five of us. and there somebody said let's just watch a documentary. and i say i've already seen it. and they say i know. but and then the more i watch the [ __ ] staircase and i'm like okay let's watch the documentary. i've seen the documentary. already and just for those of you. that think it came out. on netflix for years. ago it didn't it came. out on [ __ ] somewhere else i bought it on itunes it was the first thing. i ever saw on an ipod on one. of those [ __ ] ipods with the video it was the first thing. i ever saw on an ipod video this. was like whenever that came out. 2006 2006 2004 i have no. idea 2010 whatever it was i watched. it on the plane like this. dude so small the screen's. so small just and the guy does a documentary. while he's out on bail. saying how he didn't push his wife down the staircase. now that seems like a [ __ ] ridiculous idea just shut up if somebody thinks you're accused of a crime. hey practice touching your top. lip to. your bottom lip you know. what i mean hey did you do. it even if you didn't do. it don't even say no. just let's play an exhibition game. where your top lip team. joins your bottom lip team. 100 of the of the game. right because you're just gonna say. some dumb [ __ ] did you do. it no well where were you. i was at the pool. well she died near the pool. well i okay i wasn't really near. the i was near the pool. but i don't think i could get there. by the whoops you're in a whole. bunch of hot water you could limit. that heat of the water. by practicing what say it. with me touching your top. lip to. your bottom lip so anyway. i'm watching this [ __ ] and i'm like all right. we'll take a vote. i'm in this show i'm into. the show on the hbo max. [ __ ] but let's [ __ ] take a vote we take a vote dude do we want to. watch the staircase on hbo max. streaming with with with colin firth or do. we want to. stop and start watching the staircase. which by the way we've already seen. except i haven't seen the remaining. two extra episodes. on netflix that came out three. years ago but i'm fine. with that because i'm over. it dude you're not gonna get me. i'm not no sucker. so they say everyone votes. for the [ __ ] documentary and i go like this hold on i want. everyone to have all. the info first before we vote. right because that's who i am dude. i like to get all. this [ __ ] out there and then take the real vote i don't take the first bitchass. vote we talk about it. and then take a real vote. so i say we've seen two episodes. of this staircase streaming. with colin firth right there's one episode left that's out. that means you know. it goes to. episode eight but this is really important. dude this is the minutiae but this is so important. dude and if you're a fan. of mine just listen dude. i say we have one. more episode left on this. streaming [ __ ] it's 12 44. am and now i remember this. we're only gonna watch another hour. of television let's get to. this one and we watch the third. episode of the staircase we're all caught up. then we go to. bed and maybe next time we watch the documentary. and we watch the documentary until. the new episode of the staircase. comes out or we just say screw it. and we start watching the documentary. and that's all i wanted to. say i wanted to. say my piece now who wants to. watch a documentary everyone else it's like my [ __ ] words were just you know everyone documentary so i lost but i lost at least i said my piece so i go all right dude i'm a good guy i'm not gonna [ __ ] stall in this [ __ ] streaming [ __ ] if they don't want me to. [ __ ] you know what i mean mussolini this streaming [ __ ] so we switch platforms. we watch netflix yeah sure. he's got a bad taste. in his mouth about it. but he turns it on and we start watching the scare. staircase and that's when i learn. about this new oh there's two extra episodes. and they explain the owl. theory i know you know about this if you know about the staircase but there's a large [ __ ] population online of actual smart. people that think an owl flew in. the window attacked the woman's face. she fell down the stairs. and then the owl kept attacking. her head and that's how she died. and to the people who think that. my only response is no [music]. i'm no detective but no [music]. i'm no bloodspatter analysis but. no [music] i'm no owl. but now [music] the defense. team was like well she could have slipped. and fall eight times slippery that. explains a pool of blood in the blood on the souls. she could have slipped hit. her head got back up. coughed on the wall slipped. hit her head again slipped. hit her head again got back. up made a coffee come. back slip a little bit more. watched some [ __ ] watch some [ __ ] seinfeld binged a little bit slipped. fell some more woke up did some [ __ ] jumping jacks slip. fell some more called. her mom slipped fell some. more died blood out or her. husband bludgeoned her with a [ __ ] poke what do you call. him [ __ ] stoker um and uh look i don't know what happened. all i remember is when i saw it. back in 2000 and whatever i thought well they didn't prove. it but he went to. jail for 15 years and it's like dude. get the [ __ ] owl on the stand. you know imagine hello mr. uh owl i've got a few. questions for you who me um. [laughter] i'd like to. you do you know who was living. in the house uh that you were allegedly. near uh objection your honor. sustained do you uh uh know uh the man that is a uh being uh prosecuted here who the man. right over there who that guy. with the glasses it's the man. right there who me who well i don't really honestly. your honor know how to. get more specific who your honor. who just the judge standing right. here okay i misspoke. she's sitting and she's wearing black she's right. here never mind so where where were you. december 9th 2001 who that's honestly. not even a i'm not talking. about a person who a person is like oh chill. chill chill order who you 100. the worst bit we've ever done. on this podcast dude. but [ __ ] yeah we do them and we're proud we do them and we're proud dude. [ __ ] yeah we do them and we're proud and you can sit there and laugh yeah dude interview the owl get the owl but then apparently there's people in the south. that's that it's actually a big. problem owls really do sometimes. attack these people's faces because they feel like they're threatened. every the southern people when they talk. you're just like okay can we no. that's all i'm saying is that. there are owls out there that are aggressive to. humans because we are encroaching in. there and you're just area. and we have cut down some trees. that they do fancy. living in who you um so we're watching. the staircase and they all get the idea. and by they i mean the girls. to order taco bell. and i'm specifying that it's girls. because you know if there is a coed gathering. going on and somebody orders gets the idea or the hankering. for taco bell it's it's it's a woman. who's drank a little bit you know. and the guys go sure and then they eat more. than the chicks obviously because chicks you know they'll do like half. a [ __ ] cheesy gordita. and the dude's like yo dude. i'll house that so they say do you want. taco bell and i'm a little bit. offended because know me friends. no i don't want taco bell. and they say you sure. and now i'm doubly mad because i've already answered. and you also should know. but also no and then they say okay. and then they go to. order and they say are you sure. you don't want anything and i don't say anything. because number one know me. number two also i answered it. and number three you're being disrespectful. now trust i know my opinion. so i just stare and they go all right. so they get some cheesy gorditas and some nachos and [ __ ] and it shows. up finally and it's way. too late you know the postmates. driver is doing the thing. where he's like oh no. that address actually doesn't exist. like they'll just say [ __ ] sorry. i'm late there was a dragon. in the way post mates oh dude. you know what happened i don't care. you might actually there was a [ __ ] crystalia. rally i was trying. to get through i actually believe that. sir um so anyway we get to. the [ __ ] and they get to. the door they get to. the door and we get to. the all the gorditas show up and they're like and and they still you. want to bite and i'm like look. you know this about me. i haven't had taco bell in 23. years and then my buddy. says how do you even know. that and i go through. what i just told you i said you know. because i remember the moment. and your boy was 19. and it's probably an ocd. thing and whatever and then kristen says okay. will you please try this. what the [ __ ] is it called berry blast do you know what it's called it's like the new drink of taco bell. baja blast that's what it. called baja blast is baja. a [ __ ] flavor like you know it's not right does anyone ever [ __ ] try something and they're like mmm tastes like baja the [ __ ] out of here call it barry or whatever and i say no i'm not going to. i'm not going to. i'm not going to. drink that i don't want. to try a baja blast and she says please. i knew you're going. to say that but just try it. for me and now i'm put back. on my heels why. because why the [ __ ] do you care so much what kind of baja. [ __ ] goes in my mouth. and she was like it's so good. and i just want you to. experience it and i say this. is not really like the kind of experience. that i want to. have and she says please like for me. and i say why. for you it's for me. i just because i want to. share this and you're growing. and you're growing as a person. and you you're trying new. [ __ ] and i say [ __ ] i just went on a boat you think just because i'm not landlocked anymore. that you can just throw a baja. blast inside my face. no no no no no you're pushing. your luck see this is why i should have never got on that boat right. before you know it i'll move to. silver lake have a twisty. mustache a monocle and a top hat. and people will be asking me. if they could pass. go i'm me [ __ ] so i'm like i don't want this baja blast and she says please and i say babe look i really i appreciate it i don't want the baja blast and i say why do you want me to. have it if i don't want it. just because you don't know. you know you don't want it. and i said i haven't had taco bell. in 23 years. and she says but this isn't even really. taco bell and i said where'd. you get it and she goes and walks away. and now i'm the bad guy. i don't consent to. this taco bell though. he pressuring me and then my buddy. says you're a [ __ ] idiot man it's so good and then i ask his girlfriend. and i say is it. good and she goes like this. literally like this and for the audio. for the audio listeners it was a very deep. uh concerned look and a nod up. and down like i'd love to. be on your side. but this baja blast is is really something. to write home about so. now i'm like everyone's against me. dude i lost the [ __ ] staircase hbo max. traumatization of the [ __ ] documentary and now i [ __ ] i lost or watching documentary. and now i'm gonna lose. to this baja blasting but my ocd. is strong but then i realize it. is my ocd and i said look. baby it's my ocd and she's like oh really if it. is then i won't bother. and now i feel like a [ __ ] so yes she's winning all accounts. yes not only on the bad guy. yes i'm a [ __ ] yes he's a scared [ __ ] which is something that his ex called him and that's when he realized that was the end of his relationship. yes dude you don't call someone. a scared [ __ ] unless you want the relationship. to be over and then i [ __ ] took it and for a few weeks i lived with it and then bill burr. asked me how my relationship was once at the ice. house and i said well it's weird. because she asked me. she called me a scared. [ __ ] and he said nah you got to. get rid of her and that's when i realized had to. get rid of her so thanks. bill so it's a deeper. but i'm not a scared [ __ ] and i'm not going to. let the ocd demon as they. say control my life so i say i you know technically it's not really from taco bell. you can get that anywhere. so i [ __ ] i mean i know they do specialize with the baja blast but it's probably just like sprite. and [ __ ] you know spot. shot and some ice so let me. just [ __ ] you know it's like neon i'm like i'm not gonna look i'm not gonna like it i promise. and then she goes well with that. added to it. and i'm like no no. i don't want you to. do that because i wasn't done. talking whoopsie daisy we interrupted me. if i drink it i'm going. to let my walls down i'm going. to sip it twice. and i'm going to. absolutely give you the god's honest. truth from within my heart. and she says okay and i say i'll try the baja. blast because it's not technically. taco bell it's kind of just in. their drink system so she says here. and i grab it i smell. it because i want to. know if i actually sincerely don't want to. drink it because if it smells putrid i'm just not gonna put it in my mouth. i smell it it passes. the smell test it smells. bad but i'm like okay i'll do it. i take one sip i. let it sit i don't judge it. yet because i'm not a piece. of [ __ ] dude i take another sip just like i said i was and my buddy's girlfriend says ooh that means he likes it. and then of course i feel my blood inside. my heart because i said i'm gonna take two sips to. make a good judgment. and now she's trying to. push an agenda okay so i take that. second sip and i said no i didn't take that. this kind of [ __ ] this is the kind of [ __ ] life that i have this is the [ __ ] that like we talk about and i say no i said i was going to. take a second sip because i wanted to. judge it fairly because i told you i wanted. to judge it fairly and i'm a man. of my word okay. and she said okay i let it sit in my head. i didn't just taste it. with my tongue i tasted. it with my head you ever. taste something with your whole. head that's when you really know. how banging it is right. you don't just let it [ __ ] ruin it. on your palate you. let it envelop your whole. [ __ ] head i let it envelop. my whole [ __ ] head and it turns out that the baja blast from taco bell. is [ __ ] awful and that's the god's honest truth. so i hand it back. and i say it's awful. and i mean that with my heart. and they go oh come on and i say it. tastes like windex and i said. to the guy does. it taste like windex or am. i bullshitting and he goes. like this i mean you know and i go ah so it does taste. like windex a little bit. it's not good dude i hate. to say i told you so but i gave a god's honest. review of the baja blast and it's bad. so [ __ ] yeah now i kind of i danced. with taco bell right. i didn't take taco bell. but i danced with it. in the soft moonlight a. little bit do you know. what i'm talking about i didn't eat. taco bell but i let it dance on. my taste buds into. the palette and also ruminate in my head. a little bit without eating. any meat cheese or sour. cream so i danced with it. i danced with taco. bell in the pale moonlight but i didn't

about it. the concert's almost over dave. chapel leaving leaving soon and then the dude ran up. and and [ __ ] tackled dave chappelle. and the dude was so my buddy. was so mad and he's done. mr i knew it buddy you know he's the mister. i knew it buddy and uh and yeah i guess. they're not charging him as a felony they're charging. it as a misdemeanor. and dave chappelle which i'm surprised. dave chappelle is very uh openminded. and very um uh what do you call. it uh forgiving you know. it he seems like a very like forgiving. openminded person and look he was attacked and it was terrible and i do think the guy should be charged as a felony because you can't [ __ ] set a precedence that everyone's going to. get attacked on stage if they're doing shitty. jokes because if that is true. i'm public enemy number one. i don't know if you know. about this but your boy's got haters. i don't know if you know. about this but if this guy doesn't get charged for at least a misdemeanor. if this
