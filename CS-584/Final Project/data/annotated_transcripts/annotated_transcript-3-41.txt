said. because i like it better. not good enough be more. specific we got an hour. to get to the [ __ ] place why we're so far away. we were so far away. dude and kristen goes up. to get ready for bed. because i was downstairs. what i used to. call downstairs daddy yoon when i was a kid it. was one of my first words. so i was daddy yoon and [ __ ] um and dude my uh i was doing uh we wrote my i was watching you know what i did. every night which was cute. dude i'm cute as [ __ ] man. i was watching seinfeld and friends. with my mommy we watched. two episodes of seinfeld and two episodes. of friends didn't we even watch the golden girls. man i'm [ __ ] cute i was watching it with my mommy so um and this is how the bed always goes kristin. gets tired she goes upstairs. my dad gets tired he. goes upstairs my mom rides it out. with me though dude. my mom rides it the [ __ ] out and then she goes to. bed and then i sit and i watch a little bit of friends. and i realize i'm lonely. and then i go upstairs i go. to bed so that's how it goes and i'm just spitting facts. right now dude but that's how it goes so um so i'm watching friends. and golden girls and uh seinfeld. with my mommy i watch it. with my dad and my dad. was watching friends and he says still funny. and then i watched sign. then he went upstairs and we watch time. for my mom and uh and my crystal went up. to bed and when she goes up. to bed i go christopher come. here right now and i go heart. palpitating heart absolutely beaten ptsd. activated fight or flight. mode i say is everything. okay she says yes but you gotta see. this quel's a little bit still. activated okay i go over. to the stairs and she says look at this. and i see a spider. that she wants me to. kill but i probably need a bow and arrow. dude you know when people are like i never like when people are like dude. i saw a spider and you're like how big was it. was like huge like that. and it never looks big. when they [ __ ] do it with their hand right and because then you're like you're always like the body or with the legs. or what and they're like well. the body was this and the legs. was this you're like well were the legs. thin or were they furry. you know what i'm talking. about be [ __ ] more specific i don't do this. this is how big the spider. was so i'm gonna tell you right. now you know how the sp. how big the spider. was too big and it was big. and then the legs went okay. and it was at the [ __ ] top step not the floor. part but the next step. so i had just started its journey. downstairs to eat. us obviously okay or it wanted. to watch friends we got the [ __ ] friends watching spider coming down. he heard [ __ ] uh chandler like you know could i be any more angry. and the friend's like oh his friend's on. at the [ __ ] spot is like who his friends on they heard [ __ ] george cassandra's like oh jerry i don't know and the spider was like ooh i gotta see it they heard us still getting be like well that's because you're a [ __ ] [ __ ] or whatever and then the [ __ ] spider came down he likes to. watch the golden girls whatever. but it was too. big dude when you see a spider. that big you realize it's naked. you know what i'm talking. about it doesn't have clothes. it's so big wear clothes put four. pair of pants on so it came down bro. it was so big it. looked like i should play. frisbee golf with it and then also the frisbee. had legs on it i mean. it was so big dude. so she says you got to. kill it and i go oh but i've got arachnophobia. i've got a touch of arachnophobia. so i say oh oh like you know. when somebody tells you to. do something you're just so cocked sure it's not gonna happen. right like you [ __ ] are one of the cogs in minority. report and you're reporting to. her oh well that's actually not what the future. holds though do you have a [ __ ] flamethrower. how do i kill this. spider without burning the whole. house down okay i mean this party was so big it. had knees so i was like oh i can't do this. and then she says come on you got to. do it you're the man. and i say not in this. house i say dad you got to. kill this spider i will. not have it any other way. she's like hold on let me. plug it in on google. maps and i hear take a right. at the stack ice go. up to the [ __ ] stop star he says i'm coming i'm coming. and then i literally grab calvin's. shoe because i feel you. know when like one of the biggest mistakes. you can make but when killing a spider. is grabbing something too big people think you need a big. thing so you get a lot. of area like [ __ ] uh to. smash it right but it's always in a corner. of the spider right because the evolution taught them. to be crafty. it's always in the corner. like this and you got to. put the book up on the wall. and slide it up like like you're opening. a window from [ __ ] 1975. and uh and so i say i grabbed calvin shoe. kristen looks at me like i'm the spider. like what the [ __ ] she says you need a bigger shoe. it's like it was like jaws we're gonna need a bigger boat. and i was like really so i give my my dad. walks up and he's smiling. he's like where is it. and i say here and i give him. options i give him calvin's. converse and your boy's [ __ ] yeezy. okay i give him my yeezy i don't want. him to use my yeezy because you're gonna miss it. dude don't use the yeezy you're gonna miss it's too. big it's got a size 13. man and he says give me that. one about mine and i give it to. him and i'm like you're gonna [ __ ] this up and he does it dude. he [ __ ] smashes the spider. and he did the good thing. he dragged it he smashed it and dragged it. and then um the spider. was dead and it was great. and all is well so i was [ __ ] you know i got a touch of erectophobia so i watched a little bit of more friends. and golden girls with mommy. and then i went back. upstairs to bed checked. the [ __ ] thing for spiders. went slept all good woke up. the next morning in the airbnb. too far away and i'm chilling. right and i hear my son. i don't bacon i'm baking. i come down and my my my my um my son's like sing. the bacon song and i'm like what have i missed. my mom sings a bacon. song that's like bacon bacon. and calvin's laughing just like i did. right there and then calvin says pop. pop you do it to. my dad and my dad. says you want me. to sing a bacon. song and he says yeah and my dad. goes bacon bacon who's making bacon. didn't even try yeah just said a sentence. and stuttered dude picking picking who's making bacon. so now my my dad's going. bacon bacon who's making

certain situations. that i feel stressed about and then sometimes. it helps me through. situations that i feel stressed. about that i don't even. know i feel stressed about but i end up feeling. you

[music] so now the spider's. brother shows up dude and i go god. damn it and i'm pissed and i'm scared. but i'm also upset. that i realize my mommy has lied. to me about the spiders. and not traveling together and i've even seen the movie. rock and phobia and there's so many spiders together and movies. tell the truth so so i say oh no. dad uh you got [ __ ] got you got it dad you gotta [ __ ] get the yeezys and goes okay let me put it into. google maps take a right. go see your [ __ ] son and get a [ __ ] yeezy shoe take him right up the bathroom look in the tub so he gets the thing and he kills it the second now he's a [ __ ] like god he's a spider killer right now he's like you know he's like legit right so he kills a spider and then i go thanks and then i go all right i'm gonna take a shower and then i realized there's maybe more spiders around and i say dad i'm just gonna use your shower like a [ __ ] [ __ ] and he laughed dude and i did i used his and i took the towel and i shook it out before just in case a [ __ ] spider fell out spider's body just [ __ ] fell out and i took the shower and then and then i looked back into. and i [ __ ] you not the shower. i was gonna use with the spider. in it there was another spider. and that is not a lie. dude that was the third. fighter i thought now that was a small. spider but that one. actually looked like a black widow. and i called my dad. and he [ __ ] got that one too i'm up three times dude. whoa we gotta bleep that. out probably um yeah so anyway dude. like too many sp. i saw also other spiders. like outside just just too many. men clean it up and that's the thing. about airbnbs dude that's the thing. about airbnbs and i'm not gonna do. airbnbs anymore because when you go. to an airbnb you go. into a [ __ ] dormant place with like spiders or wherever the [ __ ] you are lizards and [ __ ] are like when you when families leave they're like oh [ __ ] this has been quiet for a while and then they go in and then some dumbass family comes in like three weeks later and just shakes the room up and the spiders are like what the [ __ ] is going on it's like that scene in [ __ ] lion king where they're all you know showing the new king the circle of life and you're just trying to take a shower and you got [ __ ] two eight leggers just looking up at you this is our [ __ ] place there's nothing better or whatever the lyrics are probably should just be that it probably is that circle of life there's nothing better than the circle of life just [ __ ] arachnids and lizards and [ __ ] looking at you there's a koala peeking out of the [ __ ] cabinet a crocodile in the pantry a wee mo a wemo it no that's not [ __ ] whatever it is and so i'm [ __ ] scared in this airbnb and then when i went to the [ __ ] wedding i went to the wedding and it was cool and then right as the the guy took the the officiant took the [ __ ] whatever you call it place he was like we're here let's give a moment of silence or some [ __ ] there was some moment of silence you know they do that at weddings they're like this couple is gonna be married so let's just not talk for for 40 seconds and you're just like what did like soldiers die let's just respect this family and let's not and let's just keep our traps shut and we're going to do it for 40 seconds and and everyone just does it dude nah me in the back let's practice touching our top lips to our bottom lips for the respect of the family we'll do it for a minute and a half everyone's just sitting there sweltering in the heat me in the back why so we did it and when we did it as soon as the silence started calvin says let's go home real loud i laughed hard little rumblings of laughter and then afterwards that's all everyone was talking about i was like well then what was the [ __ ] laughter [ __ ] right and the ducks too it was calvin and the ducks the ducks were in the lake she's like make. let's go home and i'm like buddy. i feel you but congratulations. to my cousin love. ya uh you got married. none of my cousins are married. i'll get my babies so uh yeah man. so there's love in the air. man everyone's getting married everyone's getting married. because i [ __ ] covet on all the dates you know got all pushed back. oh get your [ __ ] pushed in uh anytime someone says the word push i think of that all good thanks. training day and so [music] that's one of the top. moments of any cinematic [ __ ] any cinematic moment. of all time i mean unbelievable. oh i saw infinite dude. oh i saw the movie infinite oh i saw the movie. infinite oh i saw the movie. infinite and you're probably thinking what's that. movie and the reason why you're thinking it is the same. reason why i'm talking about it. in this cadence because it's so bad. and that means no one saw it. it's so bad what's the movie. well it's mark wahlberg and the guy from 12. years a slave and some chick. saw it wow it's bad. yo it's got 16 percent. on rotten tomatoes and people will be like well was that. the audience score the credit. score and to. that i'd say who gives a [ __ ] it was so bad. dude i couldn't even believe it. mark wahlberg is first of all. mark wahlberg is a fine. actor and i will tell you this. there have been movies where he's been great. great actually and there has been movies. where he's been bad and that's fine. those are my favorite kind of actors as a matter. of fact because it means what they're taking chances. or they're bad and they have good directors either. way i don't care so i'm watching. this movie and i know mark wahlberg is capable of being a really. great actor but what he's not capable of doing is being a really good. voiceover actor dude they have voiceover. in the movie and he's just like they say. that when you want to. be live when you die. you go to a place. and they say that. actually what happens and everything. was and they say that. and some people and they're called the nihilists. and the other people are called the people that want to. live they're the believers. and then the believers and the nihilists. and when you die. you don't just die. and you're just like oh you is morgan. freeman i don't even give a [ __ ] have morgan freeman. still be that character just don't have. mark wahlberg do the voiceover. too morgan freeman could pop. on and be like hi. just so you know i'm still the morgan. freeman character but we couldn't have mark wahlberg do this. because it's so [ __ ] weird when he does voiceovers watch. this and then mark wubble. will come on and be like because there's nihilists. and there's also believers. and then morgan freeman would be like see [laughter] dude. it's bad it's so bad. dude and antonio fuqua whatever the [ __ ] his name is dude anthony fuckwa is [ __ ] directed it and he did training day oh [ __ ] pushed in dude i just realized it's like macho man randy savage dude in the the scene in the bathroom where they're holding the guns. on [ __ ] ethan hawk get the guy. [ __ ] he comes in with a shotgun. it's macho man randy savage. it's not even the mexican guy. in the [ __ ] wife beater. it's it's macho man ready savage. with the [ __ ] bandanas around. his biceps for some reason. why was that a thing. you get your [ __ ] pushed in so how much is [ __ ] what's his name uh macho man randy savage. gonna have a clip that goes super. viral in the next few months. and it's gonna be see how much is macho man. randy savage gonna have a clip. that goes viral in a few months. and the [ __ ] the top of it's gonna be like uh macho man randy savage. knew all along and it's going. to be some for the 90s. and he's going to. say something about [ __ ] current times i don't need any of you guys i'm having a blast. dude i [ __ ] love it man so anyway i watched infinite and holy [ __ ] [ __ ] 16 on rotten tomatoes whether it's the critics. or whether it's the audience. doesn't matter how did it. get 16 should have had less how i'll tell you right. now chinese people in china watching. it that is the only kind of person. who would like that movie. and i don't mean it. to be racist i just mean. shit's different over there and they like [ __ ] cars blasted into. outer space and [ __ ] that's why. f [ __ ] tan are faster. than furious the most fast. furious movie they blasted the car. into outer space and chinese. people were just like in china. china got moved here they realized that's bad. so i'm watching this [ __ ] movie into. infinite and holy [ __ ] mark wahlberg should never do voice over acting and he knows it but he did it. and i hope he made a [ __ ] pretty penny off. this [ __ ] and then they got that another guy [ __ ] chip while china doing it and then they got some chick i love when they get the like a really famous dude in a movie this is when you know movie's going to. be bad i will take it. right now you get an alist actor in as the lead. and then as the second lead. you get a guy that nobody knows. their name but they know their face okay. like the trinidad chitwell guy. or whatever the [ __ ] the guy was in 12. years of slave but that's not all. then to to make sure that it's a box. office disaster you get for the third. lead some check right like not anna de armas. not [ __ ] even selena gomez not [ __ ] uh what's her name soma hayek only naming latinas but [ __ ] someone who's literally some chick and you're like who the [ __ ] is this and then you google it and she was in like [ __ ] season two of the tudors and you're like oh she's british. bro this movie is so funny. it's one of those movies. where they're just like two. people like meet each other. and already they're just like off. to the races in in like they're like in the eighth. year of their relationship. where they just say stuff. like you know what i always thought was funny. and you're just like what you just. met this [ __ ] and there's definitely that line. i don't know if there is or not. because i wasn't paying attention. all the time but when they say [ __ ] like you're either the smartest guy i've ever met or the craziest. son of a [ __ ] that ever lived and then the next guy's like both so you must be a nihilist bro. this movie is such a rip. of the matrix and i don't like saying. that dude because every movie is a ripped. from everything and it doesn't matter. and dude get that money. [ __ ] repurpose [ __ ] i don't give a [ __ ] like people are like oh dude this movie is [ __ ] great it reinvented the wheel no it didn't dude infinite is the second worst movie of all time second two of the new matrix here's why because it well it basically tries to. be the matrix and in a horrible. way dude they have the [ __ ] other guy who's the black guy in it. and mark wahlberg is this. guy who doesn't know who. he is and they're trying. to tell him he's the guy. to save the [ __ ] world and mark wahlberg's like no i'm not and then there's like a [ __ ] chick that's the trinity girl who kicks ass and then he has to practice. [ __ ] martial arts in this thing with a guy that doesn't like him for some reason. or doesn't believe that he's the one. just right off the bat that's one. of my favorite things that movies. do like a guy the lead. will meet another guy with a beard. and he'll be like i don't know. i just don't like him just because he's a beard. and that guy always dies. and at the end right. before he dies he's like i actually. like you anyway man this movie dude. he [ __ ] takes a motorcycle oh let me just explain this. [ __ ] before i get into. it i know i'm heavy on. the [ __ ] infinite talk because four of you have seen it but dude. basically everyone keeps no there's a few people in the world. that have been destined to. reincarnate they don't die they die. but their soul goes to. another body and they just keep going. the only way to. kill them is to. use this gun with these special. bullets that the [ __ ] 12 years. a slave guy has and he wants. to kill all the infinites because he is an infinite and he hates being an infinite and nobody should be an infinite because you just have to. be reborn and you remember all your past. lives and it's [ __ ] shitty and so there's an egg that they have to. get that will destroy all of humanity. and the world and it will. ruin everyone's life because there won't be life. on earth anymore and all the infinites will die. okay now he's trying to. get this egg for this. to happen because he doesn't want. this infinite [ __ ] to. work anymore and as he's fighting. everybody when he comes. across an infinite he tries. to shoot him with these bullets. and what happens at the end. is mark wahlberg wins. obviously by shooting the [ __ ] 12 years of slave. guy with that special bullet. and he dies and you're like oh good now. he saved the wait a minute. why didn't the [ __ ] 12 years. ago a slave guy. just shoot himself he would have put himself. out of the misery the whole movie falls apart. just kill you guy at the end. me and the [ __ ] dude i was watching it my buddy would go oh what the [ __ ] and mark wahlberg's like guess it was a nihilist dude. there's one scene where they sh. he shoots his bullet. in the back of mark wahlberg's. head and mark wahlberg turns. around and says i'm disappointed. in you you knew i had a metal. plate in my head from my car. accident and pulls the bullet. out hey i'm not a play cat stop a [ __ ] bullet ah the screener is like i mean what the [ __ ] dude the screenwriter is just like uh metal plate they go like this metal plate and then they go i just put it in you got to. check this movie out dude. when you thought life was over. but there's more lives to. live if you're an infinite there are nihilists. there are believers [music]. at war i really don't think. i'm the guy you're the guy. mark wahlberg and the guy from 12. years a slave and some chick. in prom infinite a movie that. they tried to. bury by streaming it by having it come out streaming during covid so they couldn't actually so they could hide behind the fact that it bombed did it bomb or did it was it covered though bro [music] gained the system let's talk about other [ __ ] now i've talked about only weddings and the movie infinite let's do this clip dude holy [ __ ] man oh my god i wanted to. start the episode with this. this lady dude you know i used to. think this kind of [ __ ] was hilarious and then i realized people are just got brain. problems but here we go.

[ __ ] my religion i hated it. always so i'm glad would you want me. to sign yes in my blood fine. sure dude i don't give a [ __ ] you're not chopping nothing. off my head my penis. nothing do you want me. to go to jail and stay. in a [ __ ] cavelike thing with limited. light no way dude as a matter of fact. you won't even take my [ __ ] big leaves. that they use to. fan people i will admit. [ __ ] anything even if i didn't do it i don't give a [ __ ] dude just make me live comfortable back. then it was crazy. you'd walk up to. a woman and be like i would like you to. be my mistress is that. okay and they were like oh my god yes. let's get married and then you have like two. three wives or some. [ __ ] and the wife would be the main wife would be like god damn it. that's the thing about the [ __ ] times back then is that queens it was understood that when a [ __ ] woman was big with child right that's what they used to. say the most disrespectful way. of all time shout out to. the last episode of a lifeline. it's called big with child. go check it out but um they would say like you know. the man wanders and that's just kind of what. happens and it's you know. you gotta [ __ ] suck it up. and the queen will be like okay and they know that's the deal. but then when they get married. and they're the queen and they're like oh i don't want that. to happen there's still that. thing so obviously time's changed and now it's now and you know everyone preaches. monogamy and that's good but it's like back. then [ __ ] was topsy [ __ ] turvy dude. just topsy turvy the most. topsy is turviest ah man. i'll denounce whatever the [ __ ] to. keep my [ __ ] intact um but yeah so anyway i don't have my bags. and so i caught so they said they were gonna be here. last night and then they said they were going. to be here this. morning guess what i need to. go and i knew it. too so it didn't. come out i was in the conveyor belt and it didn't happen. and then i was like waiting and waiting and then finally it. stops right there's that moment. where the conveyor belt stops it's like two. minutes of the [ __ ] conveyor belt going. and you're like no more packages. just like one box of fish. like you know what i mean. that's going around and you're like who the [ __ ] brings fish. you know it says handled with care. fish and you're like and like two car. seats it's like a bucket. it's like a [ __ ] box of fish. frozen fish and then two car seats. wrapped in cellophane and you're like god. damn it is this it. and then you just hear and it stops and you're like all. right where's the [ __ ] thing where's the lady. i gotta go to. in a small room and then you go there. and you're like hi can i and they're like what. was it and you're like there's two bags. and like okay i said does. it usually happen the same. day and they're like yeah we'll bring it. to you later on. today didn't they called me. said hey you don't need to. call back we'll bring it tomorrow. if we don't even hear. from you didn't call him. back didn't hear from me. didn't bring it so now. they're supposed to. bring it now between a half. an hour ago and between six and ten. you know too long dropped my.
