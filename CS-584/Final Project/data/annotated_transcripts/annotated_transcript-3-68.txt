[ __ ] asking like if she even likes me anymore. and i feel like she doesn't mistake. and what's going on and of course i was super. irrational because i knew like she might. be busy doing her things. and you know if i would be sober. i would never text this. kind of [ __ ] right so she got even more colder told that she's gonna clear. her head think about things and then when she's back. then we're gonna talk she got back. i texted her let's meet up. let's talk things through because i regret. what i told right and basically she just texted me. that she doesn't think it's a good. idea and we should go. on separate ways so my question. is should i keep seeing how she just cut things. off like this through text message. not even willing to meet up. and speak from face to. face do you think my fears. actually had some kind of basis. to it and maybe i had some kind of hunch. that everything is not okay. and maybe she just used this. opportunity to actually break things. up so yeah i know life. rips but right now it's a little bit difficult. to see that but i know i'm gonna get over. it it just hurts right. now a bit so maybe you guys. have some good advice. thank you and keep doing. what you do you guys. rock uh but i can tell he's he's hurting yeah yeah uh i think that he was uh right. here's the thing this this. new way of like beginnings of relationships. like there's so much reading. the tea leaves and trying. to see through like what the underlying meaning. of a text is if they've read a text. like sometimes there's the receipt thing if they've read it. already they've had it for so long. who doesn't check their phone. for this long whatever people have such different. ways of communicating and now. with so many more ways. of communicating it's even easier. to be like well why. is that person reacting. like that what's this. going on here what's going. on with that but i think in general. when you have a feeling that. someone is backing off getting cold. feet trying to trying to. ghost but not feel bad about it. i think there's one thing. that people do that sucks. where it's like i want to. ghost this person but i don't want to. be the bad guy so i'm going. to like slowly back. away and slowly respond less and. less until they just stop trying. instead of just being a [ __ ] solid human being and being like hey uh i don't think this is the greatest idea for me maybe in the future. maybe it was the wrong. timing i don't know but it's not the right. thing for me right. now i'm sorry like you're a good. person but it's not going to. work out so you think she should have said that. she should have said that. his first question was do you think my feelings. were right and that my irrational behavior. just gave her an excuse. to be like oh well both can be right. that's what i'm saying it's all. one thing yeah and i think that yes he is right. about that uh as far as moving on. and advice what do you think i don't. know i mean well moving on well. he seems to. actually understand what the how he's feeling. very well like in the moment. and also how he's going to. feel and dude life rips you know. i know it doesn't feel. like it does right. now but that's exactly why life. rips right so um he uh you know. i i think that though it's one of those. things where you don't. want to the second you feel. this coldness from somebody. you gotta you can't you have to. match energies now i'm not saying it's a scary. moment yeah yeah like don't be called. back to her and you can't. be like what's going on. i know i know it's not a game. that you can't be called. back to and you don't want. to [ __ ] jump they're going to. be like yo am i doing. something wrong right. that only pushes them. further away that's the ick right. so it's like that's something. i learned the ick is something. that people say that's nothing. anybody's okay so um but yeah i i learned. it on love island dude. well that's see there's a mistake. that i learned it the mistake. that you made is watching love. island but keep going dude. that's not a mistake. man i've seen it you one. time you made me watch. it yeah and i was depressed. for three or four days. well it i was depressed. that was a year but because yeah well no it was great. dude uh so anyway yeah dude. look this is one. of those things honestly dude. you lucked out because this. was gonna happen and it's good. that you speak it's you've got a good head. on your shoulders it's sped this. [ __ ] situation up and trust me too she's not that sh you would have figured out she wasn't all that. great anyway like that's the chances. are that that's what was gonna. happen anyway because people say that. 50 of marriages end in divorce. or whatever bro it's way. more than that and also what about just relationships. the [ __ ] chance that your relationship. is gonna work out is next. to nothing correct it's next to. nice is it less than a percent. i'd love to. see the math on that. dude it's next to. nothing so this dude isn't a minority. he's not weird and neither is she you. guys are the majority. so congratulations on doing it. the way you're supposed to. do it so you go out. there and get some drinks. and maybe [ __ ] something that tastes really. good you know what i mean. it could be mexican food. don't yeah or anything i saw it. coming dude i don't want um i don't want it. so congratulations dude he's figuring it out. i want him to. [ __ ] know that he figured it out and back. in his estonia land or whatever. the [ __ ] it's called it's just estonia yeah i mean he also he he seems like a really good guy he's he looks really happy. but why was he wearing. wallpaper i love this. shirt you don't like a shirt. i'm not saying i didn't like it. i love wallpaper but there's some. more people i [ __ ] love no you can't say that. if you say somebody's wearing wallpaper. you're insulting you're wearing great. wallpaper yeah see nobody does. that it's it's it's look at him. yeah well that's a very honestly. that's probably the number [ __ ] top top five. shirt in estonia no doubt it's a good. shirt you can get it. in that and then also like [ __ ] uh like uh like this color like that's what i want. right like not bright. pink but like faded pink. yeah yeah yeah yeah and and when he saw that. he goes like this oh wow. yeah that's good i didn't know. they made the gray. one yeah right. yeah yeah i get the gray. one most people have the pink carnation. one that was a good impression. the only thing here's the only thing. the advice thing the only thing you did. wrong was when you got drunk. you were like hey what's going. on dude when you get drunk. and like you're confused. about the way someone's asking yeah. the last the way. someone's acting the last thing. you should do is text. that person and inquire about. the way that they're acting. that yeah when you get drunk. everybody when you guys get drunk. don't inquire about someone's behavior. that has been confusing you yeah. that is the wrong time. to do that is true. dude that is true. and and and there should be a lock if you're too drunk. and you pick up your phone. yeah is that and the and the phone. senses alcohol yeah the [ __ ] shuts. down and you can't text. anyone of the opposite sex if you're straight if you're gay it. goes for the same sex. the main problem that he didn't address. is he is the bad guy. that tries to. break down into. the house in the original. purge and we have to. talk about that oh yeah so uh i want to. address it you gotta figure out. your face because that's who you are maybe. that was her problem maybe she realized he was the bad. guy from the purge and she's like i'm scared. i feel bad i don't want to. piss him off ethan hawke's. family yeah right all right cool well that's good we give good pretty good advices. to that guy yeah that guy's going. to be he's going. to be fine [ __ ] fine. dude we got you bro. yeah so i met this. estonian it's your boy mikey huge fan. of the podcast i just wanted some advice. on this girl at work. she's pretty her forehead's too. comes up to me big every day. to say something and i preferably think oh i shouldn't do it. because you know the old saying you don't [ __ ] where you eat but this other kid's telling me to. do it what's the worst. that could happen so they're so blase. i don't know what do. you guys think should i go. for it thanks guys so insecure. the end should i go. for it even through all. thanks guys that crazy. filter even through all that. you could tell how insecure. he was about asking that. last time uh uh i mean there's so much he left. out that he showed up. what kind of job is it. yeah true what what kind of. work environment is it. yeah like are you a [ __ ] surgeon. or your brain surgeon scalpel here's what i'd like to. go to drinks. later here's what i think in general. about the work romance thing. would you like to. [ __ ] on this brain. if you think it's really a possible. longterm relationship maybe try it. yeah if you think it's not or no. it's not do not do that. yeah dude just avoid avoid a void. you want a doink in a [ __ ] popeye's chicken. you're gonna get fired dude. if you work at the popeye's. chicken also if you're also if you're not if you honestly don't ever. drink in any kind of popeye's. chicken even if you don't work. in the popeye's chicken. because if you you get you probably get arrested. but but you don't [ __ ] at any place where people eat in public. that's the good rule whether you work. there or not whether or whatever. ah we're senator don't [ __ ] any place don't [ __ ] in any place that anyone eats in public. i'm matt dalia paid for by. matt dalia foundation um so far. so listen dude um i agree. with you also also i would go a step. further and saying just just don't dude. if you honestly if you really feel like a real connection. and you actually think that it's gonna be maybe love yes it depends on what kind of job. it is if it's a career job. you know i don't know if if you are just working. at popeyes and it's not a career. job [ __ ] quit your job i i don't think you should [ __ ] with you eat ever dude yeah but i don't think you should ever even comics [ __ ] comics and [ __ ] like that's weird it's like why but what yeah i mean so i think the answer is just and this there could be some kind of permutation because you left out so many details that makes this not true but i think the vast majority of times i would say just don't do it unless you think you actually might have like a great true longterm relationship. yeah like what jobs would be [ __ ] like construction site. worker she comes along and that's probably okay if it's just like a fling you mean. yeah construction like site worker. all dirty and [ __ ] okay maybe i don't know i don't doctors no no no no no hell no. no way dude but also that guy. ain't a [ __ ] doctor anyone that's only listening on on audio the guy did that kind of filter. where the nose disappears it's just. a big mouth and big eyes. but also they knew because of the [ __ ] high voice that it was sums up. i wouldn't have known oh. really yeah so old so um but yeah dude. he's just like uh he's if he's a doctor that'd be. hilarious just like washing his hands. like this would you like me. to play some pipeliner um would you excuse. yeah horizontal mambo horizontal. mumbo they watch so high up. dogs yeah they do know what i mean. they'd watch watch right here armpits. you're not gonna put your elbows in my [laughter]. why do they wash. so high why do they wash. so high dude it's so because of germs. you know but they're not gonna do. if i ever get hit by a car and you need to. like replace my ribs. just [ __ ] you don't even why it's fine. dude i'll get your germs. it'll be all good i'll [ __ ] them out but when is like your bicep gonna touch someone's insides. can i get more uh more stitching. thank you very much thank you. very much should have watched my biceps. huh famous last words should i watch them. scalpel all right cool forceps forceps forceps forces [music]. so what's the verdict on. that guy uh don't what do. you ask don't do it. don't do it unless you think that you're gonna be in love dude. yeah to be loved oh what. a feeling to. be loved quit your job. if not then just [ __ ] dunk donk doink you know yeah so we're good and here we go what's up. chris and my name's spencer and i'm coming. from scotland beautiful i've got a controversial. one for you today so my girlfriend. always gets really mad. at me because i don't make the bed. because i don't see the point. you're just gonna be getting back. in the bed at night. and [ __ ] up the sheets anyway. so i don't see the point. in making it in the morning. just to unmake it. when you get back in but my girlfriend wants. me to do it. because she likes the idea. of coming back to. a maid bed because it's more. welcoming and more comfortable. and it's just a good habit. to start your day. apparently um so i want to. know what you guys think. about that i'm going to. predict your answers chris i know that you're only chores. doing the dishes so i feel like you're probably. going gonna agree with me. matt i think you're gonna tell me that. i should do it because she wants me. to do it and i should do it. to make her happy. um so let's see how right. or wrong i am thanks. guys wow a lot of these i really like all. these people uh first off i would say i here's the thing. i fully agree with him. that what's the [ __ ] point right. sure but and i i i would agree. his prediction about what i was. going to say would be the case. if i didn't also agree with her i agree what's the point. but for whatever reason when i get in [ __ ] bed i i feel better. when it's made for me. and again i get in it. and it's not like it's a [ __ ] mess and i just lay back. where i was the last time. i was in it. there's something about that. and maybe it's just been drilled in my head. from like because my [ __ ] parents told me. to do it and [ __ ] and like i got used to. it and that's associated with like some kind of sense. of order with making my bed. but so it's weird. i agree with them both yeah. it's like what the [ __ ] is the point. i'm just gonna [ __ ] this up again but later when it's time to. go to bed i'm always like i should have [ __ ] made this thing sometimes i'll even do that. thing this thing not that thing. like anybody else [ __ ] does this but i'll like make it at like 11 p.m leave the room. to like brush my teeth. or whatever the [ __ ] and then come back and i still can get that feeling wow that's really crazy. you're a crazy person okay. everyone is everyone has a little bit of not crazy. i'll tell this guy first of all you are sebastian stan and he is beautiful. he's a beautiful guy. okay yeah you're very good. you're looking you're actually i would say you're better. looking than the sebastian stan yeah. maybe okay so um crazy he just got out. of the shower and [ __ ] threw a shirt on and did this video it was beautiful. here to drive. what i'm just saying so so listen. dude um making the bed. is for the birds do you know. what i mean i don't ever. want to do it. i won't do it. right i only do dishes. and sometimes kristen even though. we made the rules. i just do dishes i just fill the dishwasher. up i just unload the dishwasher that's my only chore sometimes. she'll be like why'd you leave your socks. there and i'll say does. this look like dishes. you're a [ __ ] [ __ ] no i'm not yep because i stick to. the rules and i abide by the rules. and anything else that comes my. way i go like this. can you drink out of that. does that fit in the dishwasher. so english dishwasher um and then she goes. like this chris and i say i'm just playing by. the rule who made those rules. her why did she make her she was like she was. like you just do the dishes. and i'll do everything. else and i go like i say yeah. but dude i said this. is the worst part she's like exactly. but so you've worn her down. so much that she expects so little of you. be on my side. i'm not though dude. this is [ __ ] your [ __ ] you're my brother you're [ __ ] dude bad brother you a siren you are [ __ ] no and that's it so here's that also my advice to. him is you are [ __ ] i also agree with the fact that it really does feel nice. to get into a nice. bed right but guess what she can do. it if she wants to. so badly is it. worth is it worth doing. it during the day is that worth the feeling. at night and i think it. comes down to if you're a man. the answer is no if you're a female. the answer is yes you know. why because females love. things and they love things. as in things to do. they wear big extra sweatshirts because it's like ooh. you know what i mean. which i'm doing right. now i know but and i have this. i have a question. for you i have a question. for you yeah you ready. what what's the question you. have a question for me. i can see it am i. a female no well i don't know. you know i i know i know you're not but it's worth. it to me to. do it even though i agree. with them that what's the point. that little the 10 or 15. seconds it takes is worth it. when it's time to. get in bed it doesn't take different. successes how about when you get it. no no that's that's right. that was the next thing. is [ __ ] you don't need to. do the corner over you don't. need to be martha stewart no. no no no throw the sheets back. up dude all right. well me in the middle somewhere i guess. so but it's just it's not worth. the feeling what this guy. agrees with me on. is it's not worth the feeling. of getting in the [ __ ] [ __ ] at night like uh that cool. nice feeling that feeling is nice. but it's not worth doing. it in the daytime. also why doesn't she do it. because what she goes out. for the day he probably wakes up he probably wakes up late. later yeah which is true. if you wake up last it's your assignment. [ __ ] all that dude just don't make the bet dude [music]. no what is that we win. we win at that no dude. you lost okay you lost. you agree with me that. it's a good feeling it. is a good feeling but it's not. worth the effort of making the bed. let me ask you how much effort. is it truly to. make a [ __ ] bed one bed out. of what ten no no. how like how much time. okay so you gotta [ __ ] take the sheet you got to. take the undersheet you got first of all the worst. part is the first part. you got to figure out. where the [ __ ] little thin sheet. is it's always tucked in in the back. under the [ __ ] [ __ ] for some reason like somebody came in like a little troll came in the middle of night and just like let's hide this they'll never know. it what's happening when you go to. sleep there's a [ __ ] tornado every night no why are the sheets all. over the place dude are you kidding. me sheets twist and turn they go. nuts they do you know. they do and then they [ __ ] you got to. figure out where they are. you got to figure out. which one goes on. top of what and you. so you put this one you got to. tuck it in on the [ __ ] you got to. get the other blanket. you got to tuck it. in and then you got to. get the comforter do it make it so it's all even because guess what dude. he can't halfass do it. he can't have this dude. because if he does have it. do it gets which he does. you didn't even really try. no then you can say yeah. i did if you don't like the way. i did it then maybe you can do. it but this is the way. i do it that's a compromise. that's a good that is a good. this is the way i do. it this is the way he makes it. he doesn't fold the corners. more no okay um all right. cool so we figured it. out thanks very much here we go. another one okay uhuh you want. to read her me. i'll read it hey matt. and chris love the podcast. and congratulations i have a problem that i'm not sure. what to do about it. that's bad grammar but it's okay i get really black i get really blacked. out almost every time i drink and i usually wake up. not knowing what happened. well there's two more paragraphs but we could stop it. right there and give advice but go ahead. but that's not the part. i'm concerned about oh soon. over there i kill. dogs i almost always get a message from a girl. or find out a different way. that oh jesus that i did. the horizontal mambo with them. but i have no remembrance it's foreign. wow i have no remembrance i hope i put my friend in his glove because i'm too. young to have kids why is he [ __ ] dartanian anyways. signed i i i guess i'm have i'm asking for advice. on how to. make this happen less often and how to. handle the conversations with. these girls do i tell them. i don't remember or just keep it. to myself any advice with help. uh okay there's a conspiracy. just stop [ __ ] drinking so much [ __ ] yeah how are you drinking so much that you're black out but also you can get [ __ ] [ __ ] bricked up but also how many times does this happen drink less dude yeah [ __ ] you i've never had anything we don't know how old he is we don't know how what the [ __ ] happening he's too young to. have kids i guess i'm asking for advice. on how to. make this happen less often how to. make it happen even once. is like oh my god that's horrifying dude. so uh he doesn't know that. he's doing the horizontal. mambo because he blacks. out and has sex and then the chicks text him later like well that was crazy how we doinked and he goes what yeah this guy has no idea dude he has no idea hey guy you don't know what happened. stop drinking yeah you gotta how do i dude get or get boxers that say you know please help. don't do this i don't know. what's happening right. like put a postit. on your dick do. not use yeah or like a [ __ ] tattoo something next to. your [ __ ] shaft no get a chastity. belt have i been drinking. get a chastity bite don't pull lever and give the key. to your friend [music]. right yeah hey [ __ ] you get so many joker hey man. i'm gonna need yeah yeah listen. dude you gave me the key. freezing [ __ ] you you [ __ ] yeah and then the next day. his [ __ ] friend's like man you [ __ ] and he's like i didn't call you yeah that was no dude i did not do that yeah i mean this is a dangerous thing dude dangerous stop drinking times like this just stop drinking i say i say a lot of the things during times like these is one of the things i say you know what i mean i used to. okay relax i used to. drink so much and i'm it's not. because i got sober. or anything i didn't go to. a which is totally a viable. route if you need to. get sober i just for. me it was like i just i actually got really sick in a separate. thing and then i had to. stop drinking because of that and then by the time i was better. i was like i don't even like to. do this anymore how drunk. can you be see i was in the middle. of a point oh i thought you were done. nope cool i guess it just got boring. there slam uh i'm just saying it it isn't that [ __ ] fun to. drink okay so people don't do it. because it's fun they do it. because they have to. you know no i think a lot. of times they'll do it. because they want to. have a point where they want. to feel loose they want to. [ __ ] do things like this but jesus. is going way too far. dude this is going way. too far how many [ __ ] times have you blacked. out and had sex with someone let's put it this way it's at least three right. because if it was one. it wouldn't have it wouldn't be a problem. if it was two he wouldn't write. in about it it's at least. three which means it's probably above. four yeah yeah one. one is like you must learn. the lesson after that yes you have to. one is oh i hope this. doesn't happen again two is shut everything. down dude yeah defcon5 yes i black out. when i drink and i don't can i have no. idea that's right that is a dan. that is a scary thought. actually yeah but also uh are these are they playing you. you know maybe there's like a [ __ ] group there's a conspiracy. how many times look at it. from all angle dudes that's one of my good things. no see now he's got now you're giving him. an excuse to be like you know. what maybe it's yeah and get plastered. and then more texts later. get stop drinking here are your three possibilities stop drinking. drink a lot less and keep tabs. on yourself as you are going. which is the hardest one. or three get a [ __ ] chastity belt. and give the key to. your best friend or mother. or father okay or whoever what about. when we were talking and you said it's not that. fun to drink and then i said yeah. but maybe he's not drinking because he people he's not drinking because he's funny. he's drinking because he has to. and then i started to. say that's why i dance and it was gonna be really funny but what happened. was you cut me off. and started saying something and my line. got drowned out so what about that. how does that make you feel. because for me right. i feel blood boiling but it's fine. because of my brother and i love you. yeah yeah yeah i also am. in this space where it's like. i want to. be like don't do those kinds of things. you know yeah so how do we combat that. well first i would say welcome. to my world right. because that's what you do. to me in a vin diesel. movie in a vindicate to. my world permit dude. i mean i mean the vin diesel. fastened anybody that used to. listen to my podcast. knows i have a whole hang up. with vin diesel fast. on the green you're an actor right. you are a [ __ ] actor spoiler the one thing you have to. do is be able to. speak want a drag race. and he can't say words in a way. that people understand it's not easy. being dragged and so why is he the most famous [ __ ] actor the world is upside down and backwards and his stardom is proof the korean guy's here is that him. as kermit yeah he's fast. and furious fast and green. hey guys kermit it's about friend. it's about family it's about family. i said karma at the venue. stepped on it three times the vid. yeah so bad dude. i'm glad we i'm going. to be see that's what i do. i give respect my dance [ __ ] should have. been like oh yeah that. was funny but you didn't but i give it respect. and that's fine you're always funny. i didn't think that that was that. funny yes wait what wow. dude you're always funny i didn't think that one was particularly. funny i gauged it as it. was happening i thought i'm gonna keep going okay. do i feel bad no but do i promise. to not you know. promise to be aware. of it moving forward yes. because i'm a good brother. it's not easy being in a drag. race you ever see the movie. boiler room yeah there's this one part where he it's like. at the end when it's all crumbling. uh the whole thing and him. and giovanni or bc. are in the stairwell. outside their office yeah i. know it and he says [ __ ] seth jesus his name. is seth and he goes. [ __ ] oh wow okay the one thing you need to. do is say things and he's not doing it. right yes correct and he's also why. do people act like he's a big. muscular guy when he's just kind of an italian. guy fat guy well no he used. to be legit jack but he's a fat. [ __ ] fat cue ball guy. so [ __ ] dick you know i mean i i don't know what this. is about family though. okay next one can i add to. i don't want to. make a habit of doing. this but i quit i want to. add to your advice. which is he should check his. medication he could be taking meds. that make you black out. that's something i learned. interesting i learned it the hard. way so i learned. it the hard way dude. if you take adderall for any reason and then you drink you're done you block. it it's way easier to. black out deeper yeah that's good. to know no that's good good to. know thank you for living the [ __ ] mistake. that he doesn't have to. uh even though he is um so uh yeah. that's the advice we have for you. check your medication and also all the stuff. that matt said and then mostly just mainly. the stuff i said if none of those. things get a chance to. build thank you wow. would be positive would be [ __ ] 100 in a 90s. movie and a [ __ ] huge star and then the 2000s. would come and she would have a kid. and quit acting go ahead yeah. hi guys sue my problem. is um that i just moved to. a new neighborhood and um and by just i mean. a year and um my neighbors are. great but it's a small neighborhood. like five blocks by the water. um i'm on the east coast. but five blocks but it's it's small. so you gotta be like careful. with situations so this. one neighbor she's across the street. and her voice is so awesome. yeah she has dogs i have dogs great. um but um she lets. them out early like early. like six yeah and change 6. 30 and i wake up early. my husband and i we wake up. early but like her dogs. are out barking at like 6. 30 for like 20 minutes straight and maybe i didn't want to. wake up at 6 30. i. usually don't want to. wake up at 6 30. i'm. looking for like seven. plus yeah how do i talk to. her and not create a problem. because this woman's been living. here for 35 years she's an older. lady she's like probably almost 70. of course. if we do that how do you bring uh. that option please don't say spin moves. involved in the answer because i don't think that's going. to work with this i honestly. i and thank you byebye. i agree with her i'd agree. with her on that. this isn't a spin move mentality. you do have to. have the spin move mentality because that's a. that's a defiant i'm me. sort of thing that that we need to. live so she needs okay. you're pissing me off no. but we need to. we need to a sprinkler. we need to we need to. we need to be clear. this is not a spin move situation. she was clear and she was right. she shut it down before you. even [ __ ] went there you [ __ ] she understands spin move mentality that's why you don't i do i just don't like that it's your advice for every single single thing it's not this isn't it 85 no no leading. up to this definitely don't work. for the drunk guy okay hey he's gonna get injured. yeah and then she's still um so anyway so crash. dude okay so so wow he did a spin move and fell anyway. so out of breath. i don't remember okay. okay [ __ ] yeah dude okay uh so i do wake up really early. and even bragging i wake up. early it that would bother. me even if i was a wait already awake. dude yeah right now that is it's a time. of peace that early if you're up. it's got to. be peaceful and most people aren't up. there still [ __ ] sleeping you'd be like i see those [ __ ] dogs wow dude came early okay premature ejaculation all right so those [ __ ] dogs that [ __ ] lady it is a universally niche niche to. do that you cannot do that. okay knit knit yeah no no i agree so the way to. talk to her is from a place. of look we all already. know that this is the wrong. thing to do if you start. with look you know you mean. business yeah it's like you we already. all know that this is that's wrong. yeah right like look you know. i know everybody in these five blocks. knows this is shitty to. do yeah okay so that's not what you say. that's your tone what you. say can be you know. you're you you put it in your own. phrasing but like i think the the the way. to approach it is just like uh we all know this. is not right i don't know what's up. with everybody else why they don't bring it. up maybe they're afraid of you. i don't know this is the tone. these are not your words yeah. but it's like wait maybe 45 minutes. like just a little bit longer. if you need to. let them out to. pee maybe back in just for a little bit. but like that's really early. and i'm sleeping and i think a lot. of people also are sleeping but like come on what something's. got to give here this. is just this is [ __ ] you're you're being rude. it is rude yeah yeah okay. i have advice well that's what the show's. for so go ahead get a pet bear. leave it outside they they won't make any noise. and then the [ __ ] dogs that there's no way that 70. yard line is gonna let dogs outside with a bear next door outside did you think about how often you'd have to. feed the bear what you would do with the bear with the bears. inside problems on top of. problems sometimes the only way to. solve a problem is to. add a problem this. is okay that is not only the worst. advice that we've given on this. show it is the worst advice. i've ever heard and also and also it is. the worst advice possible. to give to anyone about any single thing. no way get a bear. dude get a [ __ ] bear play hardball dude hi i'm chris matthews welcome to. hardball be like that you know what just say that. to her call up hello. hi i'm chris matthews and this. is hardball click oh by the way. open your window click and open. the window and there's a bear out. there and the [ __ ] dogs will never go outside again. dude sometimes the only way to. solve a problem is to. add another problem i'm crystal. lee and this message was paid. for by the chrysalia foundation and dude. i also dude um why are you only living in a neighborhood. that's five blocks i've never even. heard where is that it. sounds peaceful it's i think it's not. peaceful there's dogs outside. it's by the water dude. have you ever seen fear. of thy neighbor no it's not discovery plus holy [ __ ] [ __ ] dude dude you only watch shows no about like real people who like committed a murder right yeah yeah that's all you watch i didn't even know that but i knew that shark tank oh oh and then love island and love island so you got the worst taste on the planet that's not true no i also tried to. watch [ __ ] what's it called that uncharted movie with tom holland and mark wahlberg last night. oh so you got the worst. taste ever guess when i stopped watching it. 30 minutes before it ended. that's the most disrespectful time. to stop watching that's true. you did it it was so bad. dude sometimes it was so [ __ ] bad the only way. to salvage the time. you've wasted is to. leave at the most disrespectful possible. moment dude i walk out. in theaters right before the ending. sometimes sometimes at boring dinners. i say and you know. what actually happened to. me today and then [ __ ] leave because that's so disrespectful well that's rude to. people you know what tell me. about your day and then i leave that's rude. to people dude whose presence you're currently. in i don't want to. hurt the people's feelings. that are around me. i want to. like disrespect damian chazelle or something. if they created the if they created a film school. major if they created what is that. that's the [ __ ] guy that taught the first man. in la la land. she's filming school so i'm drunk. so uh no i wanna i wanna. i wanna if if the person created. the the thing that makes me. feel disrespected did you need. to absolutely create a [ __ ] another problem for that. person and you think that that. stopping the movie 30 minutes before it. ends is the way to. go dude and leaving a dinner after you ask them. how their day's been is [ __ ] disrespectful. because they're wasting my time. with boring as dinner. yes dude figured it out. getting a bear is the [ __ ] best way to. combat barking dogs they won't let the dogs. outside you win dude. i mean dude fear thy neighbor. is a crazy show people have gotten killed for way. less than this dude oh yeah i saw that i saw an episode. where i mean because this woman. is you got to. fear for your life. dude this is because that's crazy. this lady right here that called okay because this other lady. is putting dogs out there. doing what she wants and guess. what been doing what she wants. and all of a sudden uh you know. uh amanda who's whatever this. lady's name is moves. in right and she [ __ ] gets there and now the old lady is like i can't do what i've been doing for 40. years trust me dude. this lady isn't going to. be putting up with that. and she's going to. either buy a gun or use her. husband's gun or use her. dead husband's gun because she's got nothing to. live for anymore of [ __ ] no i'm not i'm but i'm not meaning to. right i'm not meaning to. this is real life. i've watched fear thy neighbor. and then come up with a solution. that's my main because bro i saw one where this. [ __ ] guy moves into. a neighborhood and his kids. leave toys on the other guy's lawn. and the guy mobilized his family. started doing army drills out. in the front yard. and then shot the dad. dude i'm sorry i need to. hear you say that again. i i got lost because that's too crazy. so do it again. in the show fear thy neighbor. there was an episode where a family. moves in and that family. leaves their toys on another man's. yard and so the other guy who lives there gets upset. mobilizes his family starts. doing army drills in the front yard. to scare the other family. and then the guy shoots. the dad all cause of toys that's how it. started dude yeah all cause of toys so i'm saying. watch fear thy neighbor come. up with some solutions. get a bear is that person. in jail yeah good or they killed. themselves i don't remember they always end up killing themselves. or going to jail. get a bear are completely. gone i know it's sad. it's crazy dude and we're all crazy. but it's just like people always wonder yeah. sorry people always wonder like how could somebody be like that. in their own private lives. like how could somebody have said that. to me how could somebody have thought that. but what i said it's like i know do you [ __ ] understand i know how absolutely demented. every single [ __ ] person is like why don't you keep that knowledge in your mind. i know you've heard stories like that. i know keep that in your head. nothing makes sense nothing ever makes sense. nobody does nobody nobody's actions. make sense uh it's so hard. not to someone else. yeah it's so hard. but you forget that. and then also like you ever catch yourself. like i'm trying to. limit the amount of times. a day i say why. did that person do that. good job i mean you're on the right. track yeah because it's like you they're that person. you have nothing to. do with them yeah you have no. idea what's going on in their mind. you don't know what kind of chemicals. they have in their mind. and what makes up their brain. not to mention what [ __ ] happened. to them yes exactly so watch. out for this lady because you don't know how what makes up her. mind but also don't get a bear. you know let's go baby. get a bear that's called. escalation and i don't think you want. that all right anymore. i'm matt and chris i'll keep it. short sure my question is is a like a flirt. or is it a show. of support a like i've been with my boyfriend. now for just about three. years and he is a serial liker. it doesn't matter if it's a family. photo or an ass. pic he just likes them. all and he says that it's his way. of showing support because he likes it. when people like his photos and i've talked with my friends. about it i've talked to. my guy friends my girlfriends and i just want to. know is a like a flirt or is. it nothing and i'm being over. dramatic i feel strongly about this. okay what's up a like is not. a flirt okay it's not. what that is you know. what's a flirt you know. what's flirting flirting if you think. liking someone's [ __ ] photo on instagram. is flirting you are the worst. in the world at florida. titties pick an ass pic. that's not flirting dude. how was that okay. well she's i guess what okay. yeah that is what she asked. what do you what what well. i guess i guess what i what i what. i took it as is you only own. 50 of what you say. because the other people receive the fifty percent. of it right so if i am out. there liking chicks. asses and titties on instagram. okay well you know it's different. for me because i have a [ __ ] fan base but like if you're just someone that doesn't have a fan. base and your friends all see this guy liking. we have one friend that does this. nonstop we're not going to. mention his name because but we know someone who it's like he likes oh. yes yes yes yes um and comical degree. yeah and he and and it's like you know. that becomes a thing if you're if you're a family. man and you're doing that. [ __ ] yeah right and you're like yeah but it's just about support but is that there's still other people out there that are your friends that are going to. be like the [ __ ] is this guy doing but that's not flirting. no no it's not flirting. so maybe i i no if if i like someone's picture. it's not necessarily flirting you're right. okay there's i'm going. beyond the question and what we do. here is sometimes i think very deep. so let's go yes let's go and i go beyond. that there's a button there to. indicate that you like a thing so if you see something that you like why not hit the button right. that is so easy to. hit to express your like yeah. it's not like he's poking them on facebook. or writing them a [ __ ] a drool emoji right. you're not you're not commenting like oh man. hey sexy you're not. i mean if he's doing that. if he's doing that then that's flirting. oh man he should just comment. holy [ __ ] [ __ ] bricked up city that will be flirting where you from bricked avenue. holy [ __ ] did are you kidding. me that cleavage makes me go bracket. cat cat right okay. so thinking through all the way. to the [ __ ] end though if he's flirting by liking. photos he's the worst ever on the planet. of flirting now what we do. is we go beyond the question. and if you're insecure. about that which i don't think is necessarily a bad thing. i get it if you don't want. your boyfriend to. be doing that that's a different. thing and i've actually heard women. make this complaint about their boyfriends. or husbands or whatever. that they will and men are always like you. know this is like a common. male female back and forth. that i've yeah heard actually be an issue. with people so what i just said. is that what you just said. no no no i'm asking you what what is. oh oh oh what's she saying like my oh is. it a flirt or. like there or like it. it riles up the female. makes them jealous something like. that yeah yeah yeah that's for sure. something right yeah no doubt. i guess we're kind of saying. the same thing right yeah. right right right um yeah i mean i don't know. i think it's uh but also if here's here's the main main main thing if you the woman. submitting this to. us have an issue with it or it makes you feel insecure. or whatever and you've expressed this. to your partner. and he's just like ah [ __ ] it i still want. to like it like yeah. that's weird if he has the spin move mentality. on that that's bad he should just just because i guess. but i liked it if you've expressed this. to him and he's just still doing. it like that's weird like he should just stop it's so easy. just here's the thing just as easy as it. is to do it. to express a like about something. that is in one way or another. pleasant for you to. look at or think about whatever. it's also just as easy if not easier to. not do that yeah and so what's more. valuable to this guy. expressing to some like acquaintance. or stranger that that he likes what. is in the photo that the person. that he might may or may. not even really know wow. presenting or making your [ __ ] wife or girlfriend. whoever feel better sometimes. you just speak the truth. dude sometimes you break. [ __ ] down and the latter is way. way way more important one. would [ __ ] hope yeah so the issue is less is it a flirting thing. or not the issue is more why does the guy. have to [ __ ] do it if he knows you don't like it the [ __ ] up with that well does she not like it we don't even really know but we're assuming right we should assume yeah you're really sm that was good that was good advice i'm really smart too oh okay okay so the bear thing that's interesting. how you gave me a compliment. but more or less just kind of cloaked. it in good things about you thank you. no no to that okay. i think we have time. for one more let's do it. let's do it again. dude hey chris and matt. my wife's 30th birthday is coming up. and i really want to. make it big worst wall. display of all time dude.
