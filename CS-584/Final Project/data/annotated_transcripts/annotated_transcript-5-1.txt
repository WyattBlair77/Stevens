in my head i'm out on [ __ ] lala. land i'm hanging out with the keebler elf. somewhere okay so i emailed josh. and i say listen. josh is probably too late. and i email the travel agent. don't change the flight. i'll just go out 3:30. because i'm gonna [ __ ] drift down and [ __ ] chill with these keebler elves and level and a little bit longer and i'll just fly out my day shot anyway and josh says oh [ __ ] we're gonna dream when cubans are in there okay so i said great cut to. the ad knocks on my door. and it's 1225 and she says hey you got to. get up because your rides here for the 3/5 3:30. flight and i say great. ready to go okay. so i go downstairs and as i'm going. downstairs in the elevator i have an email. so i checked email and it's from lo and behold the travel. agent and she says switched your flight. to 1250 [music]. it's 1225 now i wouldn't have been able. to make that flight if i was at the airport. already however i'm on i'm getting. into the car to. go to the airport and i'm in atlantic. city and the airport i'm flying. out of [music] is in philadelphia. now i'm reading this email and good thing. nobody's telling it to. me because all i can hear is my blood. i'm smelling around. for bacon's now one. time when i was in la cañada. i used to. go to this place that would have the bomb. ass turkey tuna melt they would. have the bomb s2 in amounts and it. was called burgees and it's still there. because they make the bomb. ass turner mouths and whenever i was in locking. out of visiting my mom i would get the bomb. ass to an amount and one. time a kid named colin barnes told me. to get bacon on the tunamelt and i was like what why would you [ __ ] something perfect up that's like eating cheese while you're getting your dick. sucked sure i liked both. of those things but separately is. better okay and colin goes like this. just try it and i say alright so i walk up. to the counter and i say hey uh can i get bacon. on my tuna melt and the guy. behind the counter says how many bacon's and i think of that. every three weeks so now. i'm in the car okay. and i call josh and he says i got email you know. okay i got the email see there's a mistake. so i say yeah just make sure that i'm still on. the 3:30 flight because i just got the itinerary that my flight. changed in 20 minutes ah all. right but i think secretly i'm looking at it. wrong when i see this. email i think oh i have to. go to the doctor because i have a tumor pushing up. against my optical nerve. cuz it's scrambling what i'm looking at i'm looking. at 3:30 but it looks like 1250 so i hang up. the phone and then josh calls me. back and it made me stay. and so i'm in 1250 but how far from the airport. and i say it's in philly. i'm not in philly i'm just checking your side. you know so i say okay. well make sure she changes. it back to 3:30. cuz i'm on my way. now and i don't want to. get to the airport it. only happened i mean alright so so then he calls you. back and he says i just kind of i'm screaming. with them is it like we got your ticket. but it's not firstclass saying where they lost. the seat and everything else was like that. scene in private ryan when the guy's looking for his. arm and you just hear and i'm just and i'm looking for my itinerary i can't. fight you i'm looking for my itinerary like he's looking. for his arm i'll just get my water. bucket and all of a sudden. it comes back in hey you know i'll call him. but i'll be in there. and i click did i get to. the airport and i'm in seat. like 4355 izzie i didn't even know the plane. went that far by the time. i got to the back. of the plane i was already. in los angeles so i'm furious. there's nothing i can do. i get to the gate. the guy i'm gonna pull this [ __ ] he said i said yeah as i was supposed. to be in first they lost. the thing and then the thing happened. and then and he goes like this. well i that's full sorry. if you want to. go first though there's another flight. the only one left where there's further first is 9. p.m. and i go like this. hey man it's [ __ ] 1 o'clock what. am i gonna do at the airport. in philly for 8 hours. how many times am. i gonna [ __ ] lap hudson news i mean like [ __ ] goddamn hudson news i've ever seen the hudson news. out of the airport the [ __ ] get it together dude go outside hudson news so i [ __ ] get on the point i'm dude i'm hearing. bacon sizzle i'm hearing how many bacon's sizzle. dude i don't even know how many bacon's. it's are sizzling and my [ __ ] head right. now in my ears so i get to. the [ __ ] plane and just to. make matters worse in first they got the lay down. badge dude but here daddy is. all propped up like a goddamn praying. mantis i bought even bought one. of those [ __ ] neck pillow. things i'm propped up like a prick. like i'm [ __ ] stephen talking just praying praying mantis and the [ __ ] video doesn't even work the [ __ ] back of the seat video so i'm just guessing
