[ __ ] figure out this eating thing cuz i'm 38. i'm still a little bit of a young. buck you know what i'm talking about him very young but uh i can do it but when you're 55 you can't do it do it i heard that robert downey jr. was had to. work out in between. takes and ironman because he was trying. to [ __ ] keep fit you know i mean um i don't know dude i don't really know how it goes with the whole [ __ ] also the sugar thing i got to. stop eating sugar sugars the [ __ ] drug man do why is chinese food. so good that's what i want. to know when you [ __ ] eat okay so here's the deal italian. food number one me i think that italian. food number one number two close. second chinese food now if chinese. foods good that might usurp italian. food okay sushi's up there also if you don't like sushi. i get it um and then there's good mexican. which is [ __ ] amazing. i don't know dude ah did. you guys see the ufc fight how crazy was that dude. by the way which what number is it. which one is it 2. 9 no no this the how do i do the new thing. on the cowboy and didn't tell me. oh here we go okay. did a new thing the soundboard. did you guys watch ufc 2. 9 did you watch. that dude first of all. i don't really watch those fights. i'll watch him in the beginning. when i did jujitsu 4. i did it for like five. six years and when i was getting into. it it was like 2001. i was watching ufc i sorts. and all the old vhs tapes. of the [ __ ] i think i had vhs tapes. of it we had if we still had to. record a video of vhs thing. and we were watching what do. you call it we would watch all. the guys when it was style. versus style you know what. i mean it was like karate. guy versus [ __ ] boxer you know it was like some real street fighter. [ __ ] that son of a [ __ ] i'm going to. kick that son of a [ __ ] bisons as short. the next bison wannabe is going. to feel it now who's coming. with me and what's going. on that's a jeanclaude van. damme from street fighter ii for the movie. but yeah dude he it would be like jiujitsu. guy versus hawk you know. it was like such different. it was like muay thai guy. versus komodo dragon and it'll be a mootai. guy and he'd be doing his muay thai [ __ ] just on like bouncing around. and then they'd let a komodo dragon. in the ring and the komodo dragon. would just bite him and then poison him. no but my point. is is that it was way. different every style was way. different they'd be like wrestler. versus ninjutsu guy and yeah. but that's what it was. in the beginning and then the jiu. jitsu guys kept winning and so that's why. jujitsu blew up and then i stopped because i [ __ ] my knee [ __ ] up anyway i finally watched another fight this one this conor mcgregor is it khabib because everyone's saying habib i don't know either ches in the front so either it's silent or not khabib nonjew connecticut khabib nagy again not again whatever the [ __ ] his name is and conor mcgregor dude first of all it was crazy watching that guy like actually dominate conor mcgregor that guy's so good at grappling right and he won and it was awesome and it was an awesome moment and then he [ __ ] it all up by attacking did you see the the memes where they made him an eagle because of the how he was pouncing down it i mean he literally looked like an eagle picking up a fish but yeah that guy it's so weird to. hear him talk afterwards. because like russians are so [ __ ] different dude. they're so different like i used. to do bid on this. but like imagine a russian. guy like making love to. a woman i can't that's probably racists. and prejudice of me but i can't imagine like a russian guy. making sweet love to. a woman he's just like what. you take you take that. guy's like a an italian. guys like yeah but you have to. make sweet love you. have to do this. for that it's good for the woman. and then the russian guys like do you take you. turn them around did you. take you take them. you turn her round she. offers herself to. you you take you grab you take you. know italians gala yes. but it is a symbiotic thing. you take it is it. is a given deco relationship. you know you give it you. get you give her pleasure. she like and then it makes you happy. and he's and russian guys like you take you. come he o it is over. but does she climax and russian. guy is just like what does. she climax what she doesn't have. penis how does she climax well. where does sperm come out. of fur girl like what no you make her. feel good you touch the [ __ ] what a woman has a clear. woman has what the woman. has cleared it all at the pleasure. the sensory you touched the cleared. and it makes a woman feel good. it pops out on top. of her the pose here. and the russian guys like you say woman. has penis woman has little penis. on top of her no no. no no no it's clear. does he have balls. never mind that's how a conversation. would go with an italian. and russian talking bah but my point. is when the jernigan russian a golf. whatever [ __ ] his name is khabib the jernigan russian. and off when he was he won. and and he was like okay. well he talked [ __ ] about my dad though. we gotta finish this got a bit. to [ __ ] that everybody in his camp you know the other guy from the bottom was like talking about talking [ __ ] to. him after the fight and he was like and then after the press. conference he was like first. of all not my best side. very sorry to. do a ufc however what is deal. with conor though it's like a worship. worse apology of all time. okay listen i'm gonna say not. my best side for what. is deal with bus situation. though conor through shared bus and why nobody talking about it. you know okay look sit down sorry. now current what about him. worst apology imagine going out with that. guy you cheated on me. rushing him jenna get off yes but what about how you tits out a little bit you have cleavage. what you [ __ ] different girls. what about how when i have my hat. on you don't say nice. head you don't say you say i i have furry hat. on what about when you don't say. nice hat what about that. sorry about the gangbang but also why you not talking. about my head you know so so so that was the worst. apology of all time but it is also a esse russian. you know he talked about my dad. have to finish personal. business have to. do business then have to. finish personal business i love how conor mcgregor loses now. cuz he's just so like he's so hey i lost but i got a hundred million dollars. you know it's awesome. he's like yeah i lost but let me just [ __ ] by another lamborghini. later buy a bentley my irish friend. loves conor mcgregor it's so funny. he'll go to war. with other people who are just [ __ ] continent writing about. conor mcgregor badly on twitter he'll just find. him and start writing him. like it's a irish but yeah i don't know. man that whole [ __ ] cult it was also really bad i was like the first time i watched his ufc [ __ ] in a long time and like that happens it's so [ __ ] bad for this is the thing man ufc is mainstream now it went from being a subculture to. a mainstream thing and it's huge and i'm not talking about how much money ma'am. it makes so much money. but but boxing has been around. since however long right. but but there are still people who don't consider. the ufc a sport now i think those people are wrong i think they just think of it. as like barbaric and [ __ ] like that and i think those people are wrong. but that's the kind of [ __ ] that's gonna keep the ufc in though in that in that subculture. ii area in some people's minds. you know and the fact that he that. was so bad i mean when i was when i was watching the fight. i mean i could hear it. in rogen's voice too it. was just like it's just so shitty. cuz he loves this. sport joe you know and he loves that it's a sport. and he loves the competition. aspect of it but it's like and then people are like oh yeah but you you you paid. to go watch a fight then. you got upset that a fight broke. out afterwards it's like those people are [ __ ] idiots dude what are you talking about you fight in the octagon and afterwards it's illegal and then i love how dana i love how dana white too was like oh these guys are net you know who ever fought afterwards in the whoever did that don't never fight in the ufc and you know that's what [ __ ] what's his name did come rushing the dinner jeff and you know that they're gonna let him fight in the ufc again it's all about money dude it's crazy i went down a rabbit hole watching these conspiracy. video is about khabib number two jenna. dolph and oh by the way his full name khabib abdomin povich nur. magnum magomedov never my god norma chamitoff wow that. guy was [ __ ] legit when he was holding on to. when he was takin his. legs and holding conor mcgregor's legs together. like a [ __ ] bell constrictor crazy. these fighters they have a different. [ __ ] mindset huh i didn't get punched i mean that hat that he wears you know is it like a russian thing. why does he look. like a poeple um yeah i don't know i've never really been sickened. about like i did this. i shot that thing hollywood. game night last night it'll air. [ __ ] far a long time. ago of a far from now. but i did it with like joel. mchale and nikki glaser and some other people from this. is us and and all that [ __ ] and and jane. lynch hosts it you know. what's on nbc i'm. i don't know but other words. on season 6 i love. how these shows can be on the air. i've no [ __ ] idea for how long but um yeah they were like are you competitive and i'm like they kept asking like they did we did some [ __ ] like interviews. before hands that they're gonna put on the online. and [ __ ] hey are you competitive and i'm like the least competitive person i don't give a [ __ ] i'm competitive with it myself. that's it like if i ran three miles yesterday. i want to. run for the next day my god that's it. but if somebody's running. faster than me i don't. give a [ __ ] let him go go man go what are we doing this. for i'm not very competitive but so these i when i did do jujitsu for the limited. amount of time i did. and when i wasn't very good ever. but i liked it because it was just me it. was just me it wasn't like anytime. there's a team involved. like baseball basketball football and we lose i'm always just like everyone [ __ ] up i don't give it like one time i was in high school. when i was in high school. i was in the saw i was on the sophomore. team the basketball team. and i remember my buddy. tim chung we lost and my buddy. tim chung cried afterwards and i was like hey man why are you crying. dude and he was like hey man. maybe if you gave a [ __ ] about something your life would be better. and i was like oh you're dribbling balls. in a high school. yeah to be that. passionate about basketball is crazy. to me but i mean. i do love when people are passionate. about their [ __ ] i love it i just don't like when people are so [ __ ] alpha quoteunquote about their [ __ ] mmhm anyway i don't give a [ __ ] about the [ __ ] competition. of all and i was thinking about like why. have i never been like that. then maybe it's cuz if i dig. deep into myself like maybe it's because i know. i'm never gonna be the best. but that's the other thing. too like cuz i'm not athletic i'm not the [ __ ] guy who's gonna be. jumping and running and [ __ ] you know. i love to. work out i like to. try and [ __ ] beat my [ __ ] but i'm not the kind of i mean you know there's always a guy that's gonna be better. than you so to. me to me it's like why try but i'm not that way. about comedy because i think comedy. i guess it cuz it's a subjective. thing right there's no oh he's the best. right like lebron is the best. player but there's no comedian. that's the best cuz some people who think is. the best comedian there are people. out there like mia but i don't like that guy. sty doesn't make me laugh. i like this guy the best. right so i don't know maybe that has something. to do with it i was just trying. to think about all the times i was ever. competitive in my life like when we ever. play that game [ __ ] i remember one. time i was playing butts. up remember that game butts. up it's a it's an east coast. it's definitely an east coast. thing and nobody it originated in the east coast. i know it did i read. up on it once. it's called butts up if you look it. up it's called butts. up and it's always there's a lot. of different versions of the game. and what mainly is the thing. is you the main thing. that butts up we remember of a butts. up there's the main thing that makes it. butts up is you got a look. at this [ __ ] on wikipedia butts. up aka a ball asses. up yeah we call that. something that's sometimes a seize rehabbing. t yeah sooey bolivar shag. nasties revenge that's what it's called. bolivar shag nasties revenge balls. deep ball z's and bear. trap blackjack okay anyway a north american. elementary school children's playground game. originating in the 1950s or earlier. it is in north america. it is slightly similar to. the game screen ball butts. up or booties up began. in the 1940s 1950s as a penalty phase. of various city street. games yeah basically you just put your hands up against the wall. and people try to. peg your butt with it and we did it and i did it once and i never really cared. about it but one time. there was a guy he was a he was like a bully. kind of guy his name. was danny brown and mike. in my in my school. and he and i was like i don't give a [ __ ] we got into. some sort of argument i was like how do i give a [ __ ] i think it was like he was like oh yeah you didn't do it. right i was like whatever he was like you didn't put your hands on the thing. as i find do it. again and he kept throwing the tennis ball. at my butt and i was like do it. again and he kept throwing the tennis ball. at my butt and they're like come. on do it again. he was like yeah yeah and it [ __ ] stung on my butt. and a lot of time. you would miss but that was like i was like i'm a real. man dude i'm taking these butts. i'm taking these [ __ ] tennis balls. to my butts and he ain't. [ __ ] and he ain't [ __ ] and i'm doing it and he's a bully and he ain't [ __ ] cuz he was one of those guys that was like a little bit like girls didn't like him and he found his like coolness in like being a bully and i remember if that was like when i first got to. la and i remember being i remember then like using humor. cuz i would always like i would be like dude. i can make these [ __ ] laugh and they'll be on my side. there was another bully. named tori and he would like [ __ ] bully. people and i would just be like don't make this. guy laugh he's such a [ __ ] and i'd make him laugh and then he'd be like dude he was like on my [ __ ] nuts dude these [ __ ] guys are [ __ ] man bullies are [ __ ] dude oh my god does make him laugh and then they're like oh i'll do they want to. know what you think about everything. yeah dude you [ __ ] [ __ ] ask [ __ ] you know i it's like it's like the kind of guy who can't like bullies are so [ __ ] dumb because like you can't express yourself with words you get so frustrated that you need to. [ __ ] fight somebody like that's so [ __ ] that's so [ __ ] [ __ ] when you can't when you're so mad at somebody you're like that's it only thing i'm gonna do is punch you in the face don't have enough words okay you made me mad i don't have enough words here comes the fist i remember you i remember being like i can make these [ __ ] laugh that's all i've ever thought of my whole. life is making people laugh that's all. i wanted to do i would want. to get buddybuddy with my teacher. i'd want to get [ __ ] with the girls. just making them laugh. and then [ __ ] the bullies. do it make them i don't know maybe just i'm not that. smart though i'm not that i'm not. that smart so maybe that's why. i did it i just did. it to make people laugh. i don't know but i did. but anyway that

hairs. are so long right. now you can't see him. i'm not like a [ __ ] gross. a [ __ ] but if i hum mmhmm. my nose itches because the hairs. are touching each other and then i get [ __ ] dude it hurts

guess but just stop complaining dude that's the thing i saw the thing tammy lauren is that her name tommy lauren she was like whatever liberals you can keep whining but we're gonna keep winning. like what what are you [ __ ] winning. who winning you know. this is the country we talk. about winning the whole. republican versus democrat thing. is so [ __ ] stupid dude. i started reading the beginning. of that book of fear that. book fear with donald trump he. was like a he was like trying. to run for he was like i want. to be the president. and then steve bannon was meeting. with him and he's like well a lot. of stuff you've done if you want. to run for president. and as a republican a lot. of stuff you've done like 80% of your donations. have been to. democrats and she was like oh we could fix. that he just want to. be present you think of a [ __ ] but yet. to fit into. that box of republican. for it to work. out it's a game dude. and when and then and then so it's like you want to. be republican you want to. be democrat and then you got a well true. democrats don't really you know. they're not prolife the prochoice so but if you want to. run as a democrat and then if you if you go as prolife as a democrat. you're not gonna get the [ __ ] votes. to be the the democratic nominee when if that's what you believe. in if that is what's right. and if you do believe that. so it's right that's never gonna come [ __ ] see the light of day you're not gonna be a democrat. and be prolife so then you a republican then. you got to change all the other [ __ ] and you got to. be a republican you got to. be a [ __ ] against gay marriage. and [ __ ] which is so rude. all of it is so [ __ ] ridiculous all of it is so ridiculous. there shouldn't be the [ __ ] the the twoparty system like that earn them. more into parties but there. shouldn't be that that shouldn't be how it's done. now now i'm a [ __ ] idiot i have no oh it should be this way though well i'm just saying dude that's so insane. how it works i don't. i don't know i don't know but that's it. i don't know was that. what did i start. talking about that way. oh when i was talking about how people should have liberals. really true true liberals really are crybaby though. it's like you you gotta get it. together dude you got to. stop [ __ ] crying and whining about [ __ ] you have to. otherwise and and and you know. otherwise look you don't want. trump to win again. liberals you have to. stop whining and bitching and moaning otherwise trump's. going to get elected. again and it's going to. be your fault that's it. that's it stop whining and bitching and moaning otherwise what you. don't want to. happen will happen that's it. and republicans know it. and all i gotta say is yeah. it's crazy it's crazy how they double. down on that [ __ ] to. god they double down that's some gangster. [ __ ] trump they wanted republicans wanted nothing to. do with trump when he started [ __ ] up and then when he did though grab her by the [ __ ] thing hey you know bragging about sexual assault dude the republicans wanted nothing to. do with him and then he [ __ ] doubled down and he was like its locker room. talk [ __ ] it didn't it's all good he doubled. the [ __ ] down and people were like okay that's how much people want a leader they don't even know they don't even care what they [ __ ] believe they just want somebody to. believe it more okay. i guess he's right if he's saying it like that. you know it's like they they don't they're not the bad. guy if the other guy is saying the [ __ ] well if something goes wrong it. wasn't me that said it. i'm just following that's the guy. that said it so i'll just [ __ ] go you know i'm sure [ __ ] hitting a button if you if you click a button and that kills someone that's way easier than stabbing him. in the [ __ ] neck it's a difference you know you click a button someone dies you're removed from it. dude it wasn't me it. was the button it was the [ __ ] i was removed from it. you stabbed someone in the neck. you got to look him. in the eyes got real. dark head anyway what's the we have two questions. together we got questions twitter questions. i'd like to help. these [ __ ] let's get this podcast out. there a little bit more. ok share and also tell your friends. about this podcast right. now put it on pause. and just tell em and text. somebody you gotta listen. to this podcast and go to. your favorite episode incident and and send it to. them alright twitter questions. thoughts on micro this is by steve. from steve steve bush tweets. i thought what oh this. guy's an elder okay cool thoughts. on my coworkers referring to. look kroy as work beers. wow i mean how much of an alcoholic. can you [ __ ] possibly be to. call the croix work beers. i don't like cute [ __ ] like that man. i don't understand what about the lacroix thing. you see about how they're [ __ ] they might have what is it pesticides. what is it it's got to. be [ __ ] right it's got to. be [ __ ] you can't have [ __ ] poison in your sodas well i mean coke and pepsi does but you can't have i don't know although but then it's like yeah but it's a chemical taste there's no [ __ ] sugar or whatever in it but then it tastes like a [ __ ] berry so i mean it's something's going on in there oh it's not water. oh it's water but it doesn't taste. like water oh it tastes.
