[ __ ] day you know unless you're a swim instructor like that's insane. and then i'm like not three times and he's like poo poo poo. poo poo and i'm like no no. and he just slid down. the glass like he was watching his [ __ ] mom and dad being taken away. in auschwitz just starts crying. and i'm like i had no good. reason to except for standing by. my no i had no good reason. and not bring him. in i'm like all right. dude you better grow. up to be a [ __ ] swim instructor that makes just bank cause i don't think anybody really wishes. for their kid to. grow up to. become a swim instructor no

like all right i'll bring him in for the third time pull as i'm bringing i'm like i get it dude. chill and we bring him. in for the third time. the next day i had to. go to the [ __ ] beach now i don't know if you know much about me but your boy doesn't like sand anywhere the sand should be at the beach. it's how i feel i'm not shying away. from it okay they say speak your truth. try not to lie. when it comes to. the beach i wanna be indoors okay. my [ __ ] friend invited me. and also sent a separate. text to wifey so i couldn't. exactly nip it in the bud. if you know what i mean. your boy is gonna have to. get sand in his toes. because his bud went behind his back okay. now he's talked about you're probably like well chris why. didn't you just i have told him. in the past not to. text wifey behind my back. all right but he was like [ __ ] it you're a new man. now it's telling me. it's part of my [ __ ] i gotta learn. to be a real person. so i take and you and he's like and you can't. get mad at me anymore. the dude double crossed me. those that have anger issues. went behind my back texted you. know so so now i'm sitting there. and i'm like and and i i hear my [ __ ] go and i see the text. and then i hear from the other room. and i go no and then i hear ooh. and i'm like stab me in the front. that's a stab you in the front move. that's not oh what do. you do oh no that's a hey chris. come here have a conversation. what's up guys hey what's going on. but before you realize it's going. down south it's upsy daisy in your plexus. so i've got a [ __ ] handle sticking out. of my plexus because i hear [ __ ] ding from the other room. and then oh that's as a man. in a relationship the lat. the only thing worse than hearing. from the other room. ding ooh is ding oh no but guess who went oh no. after that you boy so. it goes oh no so now. i got to go. to the [ __ ] beach she says oh you want to. go to the beach and i and i say i don't want. to but i'm learning. to you know do the things. for the family and yes i will go to. the beach uh and i'm going. to try and have as much. fun as possible and i will and so we get we i we showed up. and it was like there's just people in like vans with like wetsuits. on halfway and just dirty. as [ __ ] and they look like they would have 30 000 followers on instagram and that's the dude you know and just blonde guys just yucking it up that's the thing about the beach is that there's no shortage of blonde dudes where the [ __ ] are they out they just stay at the beach it must be because i see dudes out the ratio is way different when you're at the beach that guy's at the beach all the time that's a beach ass living and there were like vans and [ __ ] and of course the crazy people and of course my girls doing the girl thing like would it be these are you know it'd be it's such a slow pit and i'm just like don't get any [ __ ] thoughts you were there for me and you'll always be there for me and i love you to. death but don't we're not we're not moving. we're not moving the beach. i love you i love. you like my arms but we're not moving. to the beach okay um and we got another friend. with us and calvin's there just like i've never been this. far west and our other friend is like i love the beach. and so we're getting there. and your boy's getting. sand in between his toes. you park so far. away you never park near. where you're gonna be my buddy's like hey we're at the beach. where i said something. like santa monica i'm like narrow. it down he's like tower. 27. drop a pit so we get there. and it's always like you think it's easy. but looking for somebody at the beach. is like looking for a nickel at the. beach it's so hard. dude you're like they're just people none of them. look like my friend there's nine people. out here and i've looked at all. nine but i try to. feel the ground and we're walking. and it's way harder to. walk on sand than it is. on [ __ ] regular ground so why. would anybody go to. the beach and calvin has already seen. sand that's the thing he's looking down at saying like i remember you from. the sandbox because we have a sandbox. and um and we get to. the spot we finally see. him because my buddy's throwing a football like he's in the on the 49ers. and [ __ ] and he's just him everyone has that buddy that thinks on the 49ers. but really he's just him. and um and so we get there. and we plop down. and calvin before he's just looking. at the sand he looks up and he sees. this big vast body of water. and he looks at the water. and he's got that really focused. face that i get sometimes. when i'm focusing on something and he's looking at it. and he looks at me. and looks back at the water. and he looks back. at me and it looks like he's thinking i. never is this the end of the world. what happens if you go out. there i never seen anything. like that usually wherever. i step it's just more places. to step but this looks like and then he says says it. to me he looks at me. one time points out to. the water and says and i just [ __ ] melted. and i said yeah it is the pool. it's the big pool and we sat. down and we uh played in the sand he cried. a little bit because there were about 20. people there uh of our friends. and then um he got used to. it we got him. an ice cream uh he ate the batman. ice cream and the [ __ ] mouth was so blue he kept on trying to. give it to. me dropped it in the sand. and then mom tried to. take the sand off and he was crying. because he was like but now in my hands. so i can put in my mouth. and there's another step involved. me taking that from you. so let's have let's shorten that step. and um we gave it back. to him and he ate it. hit like [ __ ] that day but i will tell you this dude i had a you know one time when i was 21. i was with my roommate's. parents and his and my roommate's. mom said boy isn't that. wonderful and i said wonderful. huh and she said yeah. and i said nobody really says that. huh and she said what. do you mean and i said like how come you just don't say. good or even great. you know but wonderful and she laughed. and ever since then any time i think about using the word. wonderful i stopped myself because i said that. and i didn't want to. be i didn't want to. go back on my word or i didn't want to. this is the way my head. works i mean i'm 41. now and this was 21. years ago and i think i've probably said the word. wonderful only in either jest or explaining. how somebody else said the word. wonderful in the last 20. years and i'm not bullshitting. so i'mma tell you right. now that that day on that. beach with my family was wonderful. it really was and um it was just cool. man i even threw the football. a little bit hey boy's got an arm. man i mean i i do i have an arm i toss. him out like steve. young and i you know i don't do just like him but is a little bit reminiscent of him. and and when i when i toss it. out you know i'm not gonna lie. it hurts and every time i do it. which i did it. about four or five times i tossed it. out i thought maybe i heard my rotator cuff. and i well in fact i did. hurt my rotator cuff but i thought that. i was going to. be doing actual damage. to my rotator cuff and i said you know. what i had that conversation. every 41 year old man. has when he hurts himself. a little bit when hurts himself. a little bit i guess. i'll find out tomorrow if it's serious. or not when i wake up. you know what i mean. well if it hurts tomorrow when i wake up. i guess i'll just be [ __ ] in that area. for the rest of my life. because that's it once. you're 40 or 36. 37 or i guess if you're an athlete. or no if you're an athlete. before that but like if you're somebody who's got a good body. a wellworking body maybe you can make it to. like 43 but you wake up. and your shit's in pain. that area of your body's. done it's just done dude. it was like how [ __ ] uh it's like it's like it's like john favreau after iron. man 2 he's just like i did. i did it already i'm not. doing the third one um so yeah. i uh that's your body john john that's when you get pain. in your body at 40. that's john favreau saying and that's a picture. wrap noah knowing damn well he's not coming back for the third. one and that's a picture wrap for iron. man 2. thank you mickey rourke thank you uh [ __ ] the guy with three named. robert downey jr that. chris can't think of because he probably's. got a tumor somewhere in his head uh and thank you whoever the female was that we hired. that oh pepper potts who played. that gwyneth paltrow thank you. and that's a picture wrap that's him. doing that in your knee when you do. a crossover at 39. years old at a [ __ ] park in burbank. when you're playing basketball with the fellas. you ain't on the nets. you're not even on a team. at the y um so yeah i um i had a great. day with uh with the family. and now and now he just loves the pool. now even little water. we we got him a pool. table like a table with not a pool. table a table they put water. in it it's got like a slide. in it and [ __ ] i'll take a picture i'll put it right here but um and he uh and he just looks at it and he's just like it's cute. um yeah so you know. when i did see iron. man dude i you know i have ocd. and [ __ ] and it's really really some days it's really debilitating other days it's at bay but um i do i don't i hate when people hand. [ __ ] to me like i have a [ __ ] weird thing. i i don't even whenever i talk. about my ocd i feel like somebody talking like about their ocd. that doesn't really have ocd. because people have like made it cute. to be like ocd. i don't like to. take too many steps or whatever. the [ __ ] oh i can't go to. the grocery store on. tuesday i was like you don't get it. if i do it i think i'm gonna die. in a plane wreck. and i don't just think that i know. that and i don't just know. it i know it for five. days and um [music]. and so i uh have a thing you know. i've tried to do behavioral. uh cognitive behavioral therapy and uh obviously i'm on meds. but uh i have this thing where people hand. me stuff i'd rather them. just lay it down it. [ __ ] bugs it really. bugs me it gets. to me and um when i watch iron. man iron man's. like people hand him he's like i don't like when people hand me stuff. to put it down and i'm just like oh [ __ ] dude holy [ __ ] [ __ ] dude he's like he's like they're making him am i marginalized are we just shooting fire out. of my hands and my boosters with just some shorts. on and a shirt that's too. long it's shorts and i fall down. and hurt my neck. and john favre yells cut in his neck. that's a picture wrap thank you. crystalia you are not iron. man you're 40 and it hurts. how did i do that. you just sound underwater when you do it [music]. i'm good dude [ __ ] npr and [ __ ] these other podcasts man. i love some of them. you know some of them. are good like that what's the one. crime junkies that one's good they got like mcdonald's. ads on their [ __ ] they're so big they're just like have you ever had a big mac try a big mac and you're just like jesus they're just making [ __ ] bigs um so i'm training myself to. want to do stuff. like go to the beach. and yeah i'm training myself. like a [ __ ] dolphin one time uh i was at a bar. with my other buddy who looks just like tom cruise. unbelievable and uh except he was like six feet. and uh i haven't talked to. him in a long long time. but there was a girl that sat down. at our table all the girls. liked him and uh she was talking to. us and he said so what do. you do that's how he talked so what do. you do for like a living to. her he really did sound like that. and she said i'm a trainer and i said oh for what. dolphins and she and she just goes like this. and looks at me and she says literally she said. see you just did like one of the things. that like i don't like and i was just like i it's one. thing to be like that. wasn't funny like i would have taken. that on the chin. and been like all right. i won't do jokes. to you and i i kind of like know how funny. that was like it's just fine. funny it's not like i'm gonna win. any awards for it i probably wouldn't even. write it in a script. but like and even if i was gonna say it. as an adlib in a script. it would be because the character's jerky. you know like but she said see you just like did. one of those things that i don't like it's what she said. and i never forgot it. and uh and i said like what. a joke and she said no yeah. it's just like i don't know. that's it those are the people. we deal with in our. lives those are the people we deal. with in our lives and there's nothing you can. do about it dude. these are the people in our lives. she's probably 50 now um i don't know. dude but whatever he didn't like her. either he was like ah and oh that guy. was so funny dude. i'm not gonna say his name. but dude the guy [ __ ] one time so girls liked him. he was also one of those canadian. dudes that like just is like there's a difference between uh the way. americans are and canadians are when it comes to. interacting with the opposite sex. like uh canadians are just like what's every girl gonna like me. who cares you know. just say hi and americans. are like uh let's all go. over over there and get uh and get too close. you know let's all get too. close so uh she doesn't understand. what's happening and then one of us. will just be like hey what's up. with your dress really loud. and um and so he would just like say hi. to everybody and he would like start. with like you know you're really gorgeous. you have great eyes and i'm just like you're not. gonna oh just lead with the thing. about how what's up. with her dress and there's only two of us. should we get more guys and um but he would do. that and there was this. one girl playing the violin. or the guitar i don't remember because those instruments. are the same to. me what am i [ __ ] coldplay. and um who am i cisco.
