minutes ago until i opened the door. before i started just to. check on stuff and my son. calvin was feeding my son. william petroleum jelly so there. we go so that's good. so i went out there. and i it's never as bad. as you think it is well. i shouldn't say never you. know i'm good at not going. to defcon 10 anymore. immediately for stuff you know. and uh calvin just says look look. dad i'm feeding him milk. and i look and he's got his finger. in the petroleum jelly. in the vaseline and i say. wait oh okay cool and i was like wait a minute. what and he was like i'm feeding. billy petrol

more i got to. do this more you're a you're an absolute robot. you're a sociopath that. is the human condition to. do something like that and think i got to. do this more and then you start. thinking [ __ ] like well you know humans were built to. do this like it was really. when we were our ancestors and you know. they build huts but they spend. most of the time outside. in caves and you know. that's what you do and then you just go. back and you just don't do. it again that's american. that's it that's american and every time. i say that something about american. i always think one time. i was in a strip. club and i was with a uh a buddy of mine we went to. a we went to. a strip club and he went back. to get a lap dance and he went with the worst. one and i'm talking about this. was in deep north hollywood. okay for people that aren't in hollywood. they don't even know there's a north. hollywood hey guys there's a north hollywood. they know west hollywood they might not. but they
