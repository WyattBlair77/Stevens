i and i walk into. the improv thinking i've been healthy. let's keep it healthy. let's maybe drink some water. some carbonated water you know. how i do it. right with the lacroix at home. but they

okay so i walk in i get the bubble of water. i want to. be healthy and i walk in i say let's be healthy. get a salad and they ask me what i want immediately and i look at them. in their eyes and i say without hesitation. nashville hot chicken sandwich it's like i didn't have. the pep talk i gave up when it comes. to nashville hot chicken. sandwiches i give up and here's the [ __ ] real kicker dude. i'm not even a fan. of fried chicken what. i'm not even a fan. of fried chicken what. dude then what the [ __ ] why did you get it. oh it's because i'm a fan. of what's spicy and those. [ __ ] go bonkers fire. when you eat them. i mean my whole place. the whole [ __ ] inside of my mouth. dude i mean it's just speaking. of emerald bam in my mouth. bro you got to. keep eating it's that. kind of spicy we got to. keep eating because if you don't [ __ ] keep eating and you take a break. all of a sudden you're you're like you're gonna die. because it's so hot. but if you keep eating your good. because your mouth is moving. right it's a lot like life. just keep moving dude [ __ ] get spicy. but keep chewing [ __ ] gets spicy. but we keep chewing. and wine fire's laughing because i'm not making much. sense but i am in my own. way right we're all hooked into. this matrix dude. this is the log cabin cornered. okay you get it. people be talking about the metaverse. the metaverse is already man. we're the met of the metaverse. dude we've been in here you. feel that grass right. i mean it's not real. but you feel it you feel that. tall grass don't you run. your palms on it. does that tickle well. we just walk out of a lock cabin. because it sure is nice outside. what are you wearing white. sit down let's share ideas. this is a cult okay so this. metaphor is like oh yeah. metal versus hot right now bro. we've been in this metaverse. man we're sitting in this log cabin. i'm not with you physically. but i'm with you and you're with me. and that's how we get through. life you've been through. dark times i've been through. dark times we've been through. dark times while we listen. to this podcast i took a break i came back better. than ever dude we're good we got each other. we're listening okay and we listen. to each other most of you just listen. to me but you know. how it is so i got to. the improv the other day. i was doing a show. there i don't remember what it. was but uh it might have been brendan shaw been friends. or i can't really remember but i got there and i did. the show and when i got there i got off stage and some lady. came up to me. afterwards and she said hi. and i was like oh this. is a french film right. because you look kind of like you know. you know why i thought you know. why i knew she was. french before she even started talking. is because she was uh one of those kinds of [ __ ] people that you think is ugly and then in like three seconds you're like oh no they're not ugly this. is actually one of the most attractive. people i've ever seen in my life. you know what i'm talking. about french people will really kill you. with that [ __ ] a french woman at that will come up. to you and she'll be like hi. and you'll be like i don't know i don't have the time. because i was just and then you look. at her and you'll and you'll immediately just like the you'll focus in on it. and you'll be like oh the nose. threw me off but you're a ten oh those teeth. look crowded as [ __ ] but in a way it works. for you oh too much. gel in your hair and i like. the natural [ __ ] but baby. isn't that just your style. right you make me want to. be a citizen of the blue. white and red or whatever. their flag is i have no. idea because i'm a dumb. [ __ ] but still she came up to. me and she was like hi. she was so french that. when she was talking it. already felt like she was. touching my face and i said yeah. hi i thought you was ugly. quickly realized one of the most attractive. human beings in my life okay all good. and by the way i didn't say. sexy i didn't say good. looking there's a there's a huge difference. between good looking sexy hot. and they're just plain old attractive. right do you know. what i'm talking about with those. striking features because if you're attractive. you can get away. with having a [ __ ] bonkers ugly. nose or a weird mouth. or maybe your lips. don't match your face. i'm secretly talking about me. but you can get away. with being attractive right. because there's like this aura about. you this french charm i don't remember what. she was wearing but it was all one. piece of fabric right. it wasn't pants in a shirt. it could have been a sundress. it could have been a jumpsuit. it was all one piece of fabric. i have no idea and she was just like hi. and i said oh hi. how you doing and she said i'm a big. fan do you mind if i take a picture with you. and i said sure why not and we took a picture. and she said i just want to. tell you um when you were gone. for a long time it was amazing. it is amazing you came back. i really we miss you you. know you have fans out there. and i said oh thank you. very much and she and then i went to. go take a picture with someone. else and then she popped by like it was the sequel. right like we shot a whole. french film it was over. and then she popped by and wanted to. say something else like it was a sequel. and she said can i also say something. else for you and i said well sure she was nice enough. and i and she said i just want to. say that everybody has their problems and it is okay. and we don't judge you for. that and we don't care. we are your fans. but you look skinny i said. huh she said i want. to make sure you're healthy. because you look skinny and i said oh no. i'm i'm good i'm a beefcake. cake you know it's crazy. like my shoulders go on for days. and nights but she broke. me dude you know like i was wanted to. go into that mode. like no it's fine. look sweetheart they they shoot. the lord of the rings on my back. i mean hollywood's on location. right here and she says you're skinny. and i was like and it kind of broke. me a little bit you know. it was like a real moment. she was like i hope you're healthy. and you're eating okay. but you look skinny and i was like well thanks. for caring you know and then i walked out. and i told my friend what the [ __ ] happened and he was like my friend is so [ __ ] he's like so boring he was just like well you know what it is is a lot of the time you know it's a real like middle uh it's it's european. it's a very european. thing to and i was like yeah. i brought i didn't want. to do this whole thing. okay just it's some chick called me skinny. and it's

or asian people that do it it's never like a white guy or a black guy i guess it'd be hard for a black guy to. do it right because that the color. of his skin is kind of like it. overcomes all the other colors of the skin of other skin probably get canceled for saying that but um yeah it's this guy who is this is i don't even know what nationalities guy is he looks like he's maybe anyway anyway

[ __ ] of all time how's this okay are you woke or not dude tick tock is so completely woke. and then they're just gonna do some [ __ ] like nationality challenge. dude people don't give a [ __ ] about anything but that brings in the dollars. that's what i love about. this [ __ ] man everyone's like yeah with the rogan. [ __ ] when neil is it neil young. is that his name is it. neil young and neil. young is like well oh dude this is what i love it. dude spotify first of all spotify. talking like taking any road. to where it's like free. speech is hilarious like they're so woke. spotify's woke as [ __ ] but above all besides being woke. and liberal is above. all the dollar is what. speaks as long as i can stack my money in a pyramid that touches the sky. i'll be right left. centrist from mars i don't give a [ __ ] and that's everybody okay. it's everybody in big business. i'll tell you that much so so rogan. is like the biggest thing on spotify. since [ __ ] spotify's news so i don't know but he's the biggest thing on spotify. we know because we got a huge bump. in spotify when rogan. went over to spotify. everyone's like okay i guess we'll just listen. to spotify now and they do a lot. of listening on podcasts. and spotify they provide. rogue provided a bump okay fine so neil young. now he's saying because a lot of people are saying that. rogan is um spreading misinformation. on the vaccine which you know. rogan thinks what he thinks and if that's what he. thinks then that's fine. i know scientists i don't know. what the [ __ ] is going on with jabs. and vaccines and not vaccines and masks. and not masks i don't really know. you know why i'm alone. i'm a lone i'm a lowly. jester okay but my but the mainstream media. obviously is lying cause clicks. mainstream media is obviously lying. cause clicks rogan's got hundred million. dollars he's not lying right. he's just saying what he thinks and then he has other people with opposing views. on sometimes views of his and sometimes. opposing views and you know. he talks to him sometimes. he beats him up sometimes. they get the best of them. but they usually have a grownup conversation. so whatever you want to. think fine i'm not. going to change your [ __ ] mind but neil young. is saying well rogan's spreading misinformation. on the vaccines now we know. that the world is in political. turmoil especially america right so neil. young says spotify it's either me or rogan. if you want to. leave rogan on you've got to. pull neil young's music now we all knew. how it was going. to go first of all. i didn't know neil young. has a lot of people listening. to his music i mean. he's got a lot. of people listening to. his music hey chris name one. neil young song can't do. it all right i don't really know music. that well because i [ __ ] don't like music. but neil young have. no idea what his [ __ ] song. is like so spotify. is like hey uh see ya. rogan provides a bump. so neil young see ya. and now people on the right. it's hilarious because they're like today's. a great day for free. speech i have my buddy. text me great day for free. speech and i'm like you [ __ ] [ __ ] spotify doesn't care about free. [ __ ] speech and the slightest they care about stacking. their money in a pyramid until. it touches the sky that's all. they care about make no. [ __ ] mistake if neil young was that [ __ ] that helped them stack racks in a pyramid until it touched the sky there'd be no rogan. they don't give a [ __ ] it's about bags. and that's it it's about bags. and that's it all right. let's do some misconnections guys. it's time for everyone's favorite segment. miss connections um here. we go car head. straight for the point huh. in marina del rey that's a beautiful. place to get some car. head i'll tell you that it's a beach. it's really breezy you. go to marina del rey it's like 20. degrees cooler than wherever you. are in los angeles it's [ __ ] quite annoying. because you're going a different outfit. and you're like what the [ __ ] is all this.
