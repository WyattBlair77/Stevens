thinking. about also being it. like a chick if you were a chick. like i just wiped my nose. with my [ __ ] shirt like that and i know i'm not even 40 but you boys. got some miles on him. but like a girl can't do that. i did whitney cummings. podcast she couldn't [ __ ] him wipe her nose with her shirt. people like make a jif of it. bro me your boy. make a jif of it. what the [ __ ] anyway i'm going to. peoria i'm going to. chicago illinois i was in houston dude. your boy had a day. man i think i'm a rapper. dude like straight up i was walking through the airport. in houston i had just landed i. heard a chris and i looked around. and dude it's [ __ ] legend dj premier oh bro you know me i've been knowing you since high school. now granted we text. and we [ __ ] instagram but bro

like this shh if you leave if it gets lead i know it's you dude i'm in the hiphop game now i know secrets i know i know hiphop secrets i would never tell them okay i'm premieres boy jenna sammy he trusts me so when you're asking yourself we see old clips and say what happened to. that boy you look. at me now he's oh that's what happen. to that boy he's very trustworthy so so i [ __ ] he told me. what's going on and we talked about a little bit. and he made a video put it on his instagram. i [ __ ] reposted it and then he reposted mine. bro it kept going it was like inception. i was like how many times do we reposed. the thing got so small on. the twostory post you know people keep proposing. to keep proposed to. keeper horses like those russian. dolls hey russians those aren't good. anymore okay you know those [ __ ] russian dolls that keep coming out. of each other those were cool. in the 1600s it's 2019. i get that it's a [ __ ] fixture lose. it you know those are firewood you know why. there's ipads russian dolls dude. anyway so anyway i [ __ ] i met dj premier it was so cool he was leaving. houston and i forgot he was from houston because i think of him. as a new york guy. my brothers from htown and then [ __ ] bun be texted me. told me yeah i'm coming. to your show and i was like hell yeah. i got him tickets. you know and then bun be got there and he was like i'm here bro. and then i was like come on back. came back and [ __ ] we chilled for a little bit so what my point is i hung out. with dj premier and also bun be in one day. i'm a rapper they probably should put me in one of those. [ __ ] miniseries documentaries and that. netflix do be like yeah. well you know when i was in houston one. day i hung out premiere and also bambi and that's just like how the hip hop hip hop game. was back in 2019 wow imagine if it cut to. me on that and i said that. and then they'd be like is that. the [ __ ] guy from that show. anyway dude but it's you know [ __ ] bun b and dz over me or to. my favorites and and that's what's up. all i also added another. show in a really ontario. wherever the [ __ ] that is even though. it's a madeup place for sure. that would be a place. in like it's like they were referred. to in narnia. in the movie narnia movies. and they'd be like it's because we're all trying. to get to earlier. and they'd be like don't speak of that. place and then at the end you go. there and it's realize it wasn't what you thought. it was the whole time. and but it's beautiful. anyway we shouldn't play an irvine. i'd even know that and the pasadena ice. house jesus christ what happened to. that boy anyway i watch the irishman. and people were talking about how fantastic. it is and yeah i mean. scorsese really can make a [ __ ] movie huh. that's what you realize when you watch. that movie you'd be like all courses you could really make a [ __ ] movie huh. this guy just killed it. like the [ __ ] sequences and [ __ ] the sequences and the scenes the scenes

remember goodfellas where he was just like as far back as i can remember i always wanted to. be a gangster man. my lamb you know. yeah whatever the [ __ ] it was and then in this one it's just like hey you know when we first started and it just that's how i [ __ ] de niro and then but uh yeah i watched it and wrote my buddy sebastian is in it okay this sebastian maniscalco bro i knew he was in it okay but when you see him in it you're like oh dude my friends in a [ __ ] nut martin scorsese movie and he's [ __ ] dude got sunglasses and he's just walking around dude he's acting with veneer oh

irishman and i was thinking about how anna paquin was in it and i was like man she's kind of killing. it in my head i was like man. she's killing it and she doesn't even. really have lines you know and i was like that's just to. goes to show you. is you don't need lines. to be a good actor you know. i'm talking about and and and i was looking at twitter. i think is this dude. it's yeah good okay i was looking at twitter. and people were like upset. that anna paquin through. this [ __ ] kills me the people that said anna pat. anna paquin only had seven. lines in the irishman and them. and and people were like oh it's sexist. and it's like so hilarious first. of all because just make the [ __ ] movie you want your martin [ __ ] scorsese well what do you think martin scorsees. gonna make a movie about he's gonna make a movie about some [ __ ] old gangsters. that's so he's gonna make a movie about okay. so people are like oh anna paquin. was in an eames you only. had seven lines first. of all she auditioned for the part. you don't get hollywood okay. see ya the gunk yeah. all right now also the movie is literally about one. of the main parts of the movie. is about a dad. and a daughter that don't have a good. relationship and don't speak to. each other so how the [ __ ] are you going to. give her more lines when that's what the movies. about people are so [ __ ] i wrote people mad. that anna paquin only had seven. lines in the irishman the movies. about how de niro. wasn't a good dad. and didn't talk with his daughter. also had a pack was still killed it. and i was thinking about how anna paquin. was killing it her. performance was true acting just not with the lines. dude and you know that's hard. to do it's so late. like there's not enough [ __ ] everything they reboot is with women. anyway dude right now it's like ghostbusters. and [ __ ] and then they made charlie's angels which is uh you know [ __ ] women and and it [ __ ] bombed i can tell when the movies gonna bomb dude i can't wait til that cats movie comes out bro i can't wait til that cats movie comes out that [ __ ] casting of the cats movie is the most atrocious casting of all time dude it's hilarious and by the way good [ __ ] actors in that movie just the way it's cast and how put together it is bro it's such a jason was in it imagine he's in it just like that [ __ ] song boo boo

beatles beatles. are rolling over in the group. beatles songs [ __ ] suck to. you though you know beatles. songs [ __ ] they're just like we live in a yellow. submarine all right dude. [ __ ] people love the beatles. bro and they're just like lucy in the sky. with diamonds and people are like oh but it's about lsd. oh really oh yeah okay john lennon. is the [ __ ] though that imagine song i mean it's a disrespectful. but john lennon is the [ __ ] i remember when i was a kid. i saw a [ __ ] movie called backbeat about the beatles. with my parents and ringo was only in like two scenes. and after the [ __ ] movie i said to. my dad i said hey imagine you were. in you you you were an actor and you got the part. of ringo and you're like hey guys i'm gonna be in a movie. about the beatles and i play. ringo people would be like so [ __ ] like excited and then you're only in two scenes. and then my dad laughed and it made me feel. so [ __ ] good and because i love to.
