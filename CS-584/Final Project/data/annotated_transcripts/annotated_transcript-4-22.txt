[ __ ] do it you know i watch this [ __ ] into. the storm q thing this. queue into the storm uh. his cue into. the storm on hbo max. and it's just like it. was one of those things that i just didn't want. to watch because i knew it. was going to be heavy. but kristen put it on and i was like nah. come on babe and she was like what. just give it like five. minutes and i was like i'm already [ __ ] if you give something like this five minutes i'm all in you think i can i can't you think i could turn off a documentary about queuing. on bro one time. when that documentary loose change. came out i was on the the floor. of my apartment and i just clicked on. it and i'd watched the whole thing. on the floor of my apartment. and i was like god damn. you can't get dude. when it comes to. conspiracy theories or breaking them. down or negating them. bro i am all in i'm sucked. in dude i'm sucked in forget. it so i watched this. queue into the storm it's like. six episodes i finished it all. in [ __ ] three hours even though they're an hour. each i finished it very quickly. though it was about how 8chan was created. for free speech because you know there was a [ __ ] thing that the gamergate was the first thing that like stood up. to quoteunquote cancel culture. because video games were heavily. male popul populated and the characters were male and they were four. men and then a vocal minority. was like what about the women. characters and [ __ ] like that and then gamergate was like [ __ ] that we want to. be we want our games. they can't [ __ ] with our you know gamers. they don't [ __ ] around dude. if you're near a gamer and you're like you bring up. like red dead redemption you know. it just looks like because rockstar was severely underpaying their and you're just like yo bro. i just i was i wanted. to be a cowboy. and kill a [ __ ] bunch of people i don't know what you're talking about dude. it stinks and laugh you know because it's like um yeah so gamergate was like the thing. i think it was on 4chan. but it was like this. thing that was like [ __ ] this don't let the women. take over video games. it was highly extremely sexist. and you know it. was shitty and then they i think something like they went. to like limit the posts about it. so it seemed to. be like they were saying it was like censorship or something. like that so then they made 8chan and 8chan was his. thing was like [ __ ] it dude this is free speech and we're going to. [ __ ] die by this sword die. on this sword of free. speech free speech and um they made 8chan and 8chan was just like all of a sudden heavily. racist it was like oh good nazis were like finally we can just we can chat. about it man we could just talk about these jews. nazis were just like oh there's 8chan cool. rally up the troops come. on come over to. 8chan we're going to. talk about jews and people from 8chan would be like well you could say whatever. you want it's free speech. that's what america that's the cornerstone of what. america was [ __ ] found on and it incited. violence and then that's how q anon blew. up and then people were like you know q. anon was was the number one thing on 8chan and that how q anon was. like becoming this huge thing. and then it was too. late it was a movement. it was reddit banned q. and on post but it was too. late because they were already. mobilizing on 8chan and the people on 8chan the creator of 8chan um was like. [ __ ] it i need to. i need to quit. and then so these guys bought it from them. and then they were these free speech. uh these people who really believed. in free speech and then the the creator of hn. was trying to [ __ ] take 8chan down because they were like oh this isn't right anyway it's fantastic. this documentary it's like three it's like six episodes. long and the reason why you know that. it's good is because my dad. said it was boring. but um it was just crazy. to hear about these q. anon [ __ ] man like just insane like they just leached on to. the [ __ ] save the children. thing where it's like everyone's like hey what's up. with uh like q. anon would be like well don't you believe do you believe in queuing. on and you'd be like nah. all that stuff sounds crazy. and they'd be like well what about. the save the children. thing you believe children. should be saved right. and then people are like i mean. yeah yeah who wouldn't okay. cool then you're with us and then some idiots. would just be like okay. let's do it [ __ ] it it's just like dude. who it's like hey they shouldn't hey you hate. crystallized comedy yeah well. what do dude do you like when they just [ __ ] blow up. buildings for no reason no well chris salia believes. that you shouldn't blow up. buildings for no reason right. so he's funny right. i don't know man i i guess. so here's a there's a free. ticket well i just i said here's a [ __ ] free ticket. come okay followers man. you know and it's just uh it's just odd. because people are so susceptible to. [ __ ] i mean they think that babies are being eaten. by hollywood elite i was in hollywood. you know i've been to. the parties zero babies. were being eaten they don't. even [ __ ] eat carbs. do you know what i'm talking. about they don't even eat carbs. they're [ __ ] vegan it's just but i came out to. this thing with other i don't even. know if i believe free speech. in free speech anymore i mean. i i think it's important. i think free speech i think there. should be free speech. but like hate speech is. [ __ ] insane and i also here's another thing. that i think would [ __ ] absolutely fix it. no anonymous [ __ ] ever again. you have an account online. you post you sign. everybody knows that that's you no. doxing doxxing is [ __ ] shitty. as [ __ ] because that's free speech too doxing you. can go out there and be like yo this. is tom cruise's address. free speech but it's [ __ ] up it's absolutely [ __ ] up so that free speech am i for doxing not enough for that i think if you sign in i think everybody who goes online has to. speak as themselves if i sign in to. wherever twitter hn a [ __ ] now is what it. is [ __ ] um instagram it's it's crystalia. no dummy accounts right if you're looking at my story i know you saw it there's no dummy there's no finster there's no [ __ ] you know how much that would curb violence. you know how much that would curb. violence so much people be like well i hate jews. but i don't want everybody. to know about it what. about that plan nope. whatever i'm just a [ __ ] comedian i'm just like this boxing shit's gotta go i gotta start doxing people man. just straight up people just who people who disagree. with me just be a [ __ ] on my instagram story so here's somebody who said something. about me and here's where they live. go babies and they just show. up and they just start. going it's like they just started. going outside of their house.
