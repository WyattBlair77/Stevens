styrofoam. and i said styrofoam. and i said oh it's styrofoam. and he said styrofoam. and i'm like that's cute. i was like it's like um ah whatever and then i left. it came to. life you know what we i bet. we know at least a dozen. people that's that's still styrofoam. wow dude that's so dumb. it's unique to. people we know we know. truly some of the dumbest [ __ ] i know on earth dude i love dumb people. yeah because then you stand. out because you don't seem as dumb. booyah but that's not true. oh yeah and that's not true. do you know why because dude. when i'm hanging out i just want. to chill dude. i don't want to. talk about [ __ ] [ __ ] that matters i'm gonna talk about cargo pants. and just like you know. what kind of [ __ ] turkey do you eat and that's what makes you dumb and booyah from the ropes boy. having a [ __ ] stroke i think dude. i think that it's not. that and i'm not dumb. and i'm actually smart and i'm so smart. that i don't need to. talk about the smart. stuff because i already realized it. so let's get into. some cargo pants from the top. ropes okay the thing about you you're this. guy you are not dumb. what's tragic about you and that's that you so let's get into. it seem dumb because you don't. apply yourself booyah boo yeah and booyah. that's so [ __ ] annoying but i'll tell you this much dude. none of that's true i [ __ ] just apply. myself and you know when i do stand. up i i excel because i do. it and i'm very good i'm very good with my words. you're very and i perform. very very good at that. because it's instant gratification. you couldn't do anything possibly. that required a little bit. even mediumterm gratification it has to. be instant immediate gratification or else. you won't apply yourself because you don't. see the longer term or mean. even mediumterm goals as viable. the closest not the words not. even words and it kind of kind of funny. rankin donuts sad rankin tiny. sad mad world mad world worst. shot of all [ __ ] time balls are great. man they're in oregon. yeah aaron aaron darren aronofsky. yeah darren aragonovsky um i saw a [ __ ] hellraiser. the new one then saw you know. how i do it. if you're a [ __ ] my brother what did i do after i saw the [ __ ] new hellraiser. you saw the first one and then even all of the ones. in between which if i didn't because that would have taken. you 48 years because there's 30. 000 hellraisers 11 hellraisers. oh this is the 12th one. this is the eleventh one. now were you saying the original. is not good it doesn't. hold up it's just like yeah it. it i mean okay well you're wrong. i mean look i like the idea a lot. yeah it's a great. idea is great the concept all is awesome. yeah it's just it's not something. that is really that good and i i agree. with that but the first one. i mean i haven't seen all of them. granted but i think of the ones. i've seen the first one. is the best one just because the premise. is like new and they're exploring it. for the first time and it's not anything. like they're not like forcing it. yeah i mean well they're not forcing it. that's for sure but also that was when snm was like kind of a thing. that was like what the [ __ ] is this right. and then so they they made this whole like you know. these people from a different dimension that like pain. is pleasure. and [ __ ] and they can't tell the difference and also those those demons are [ __ ] [ __ ] up and scared really well done yeah like bro horror i mean they can do it really well um but the thing is is like after the first one the second one it gives you a little bit more insight into. it so the second one. was like okay so i'm like this. watching the second one. i'm like the third one. then in 1992. it's a fan favorite but i go. like this i just don't sing. so oh yeah i'm not into. that one dude i mean. it was 1992. and i was just like i don't know. it was a good year. though for movies in general. yeah i know and the woman. in that is so hot. unbelievable okay why is it. ashton sing so because it's so 90s. and like camp kinda i like 90s. though i know i like 90s. too dude you're talking to. a 90s boy i. mean you're talking to. a sincere 90s boy. i mean i look at the 90s. and i go like this. okay yeah now we're talking yeah. but you don't like that much. [ __ ] from the 90s. nah i do i do i do and frankly. i tell it like it. is all right so speaking. of hellraiser my mom is a hell razor speaking. of hellraiser speaking of the first part. of that word hell yeah. hollywood california you know you. know what it is yeah. hollywood california has turned into. hell i sound like i'm a [ __ ] anchor on fox news. but no but you can't turn around. on any street and not run. into either a [ __ ] massive encampment with crazy people circling around or a burnt down encampment where people are just sitting around like it's a [ __ ] picnic okay the other day i was [ __ ] i was driving through and this wasn't even deep in hollywood this is pretty far east which is where i usually am if i'm um at all yeah and i stop at a red light and i and i see a crazy person and how do you know she's crazy crazy eyes she got the crazy eyes that are like look they look like they're looking different ways even though you're not a doctor but you're saying okay and she's walking jagged zigzaggy okay she could be drunk okay and here's the real telltale this is how you know they walk exactly when they're not supposed to and they don't like when they cross the street yeah they cross the street exactly when it says not to right and they stay put exactly what it says to cross the street okay now then now i buy this now here's another way i knew because i saw her coming i thought oh great she's probably gonna [ __ ] with me because that's the story of my life who does she [ __ ] with me she stands right in front of my car now it's a green light okay she's going like this i mean [ __ ] uh harry potter and her eyes are all going all different directions voldemort but here's the crazy part drunk voldemort she had no shirt on like a bra no no shirt or bra like just the taters were out tannen having a day dude and then when she was doing this [ __ ] the boobs would go and fluctuate so she go wow was it hot at all uh was it hot to look at or was it no it was hot outside no but was it sexy i mean don't be gross i'm the one that's gross she's in the middle of the street with the [ __ ] she's gross i'm saying of course it wasn't like sexy i know i don't think it was but i'm wondering if you think it was she looked strangely not at all dirty too like usually she was a homeless person or just a french person she thought she was at a nude beach yeah no she was crazy you could tell a look in her eye okay so she was going like this at me though and pointing at. me you know and then when she finally moved on she just she just did one of these like like it was like it. was me who was the crazy. one like this and they just kept walking. oh that's the true sign. of crazy yeah like i failed. to live up to. my end of the bargain you. know what i mean she's just like this. you were supposed to. jump i wish i knew what i was supposed. to do i would have thrown it. back but all i did was i swear. to god all i did was this. yeah yeah well what can you do. when they're shaking it i was trying. to not like i wanted. i didn't know what she was doing. but i wanted her to. know i wasn't like disapproving or angry. or grossed out even. though i kind of was all. of those things what if she did. that and you just go like and then you were like i don't know. what i'm supposed to. do so you just went. like this what do you think she would. have done like [ __ ] oh i [ __ ] and i knew it i don't think she would have even [ __ ] noticed honestly yeah yeah you know yeah okay well and that's how i roll that's a shame i've seen naked homeless people before it's because dude i saw a guy in la once and this was before the pandemic and everything went to. [ __ ] but i saw a guy walking down the street. just dick out naked. no clothes like he was shopping. just like at target just walking. like kind of swing his arms a little bit just fat. and just walking down the street. and i'm driving i go oh my god dude. so he wasn't uh like a crazy. nudist he was he was a homeless he had to. be crazy but it he did. not look crazy right if he was just walking. with clothes on would not have thought. he was crazy so you saw his dim. boss flapping oh yeah okay. okay i drove by and i was like no yeah. and then you turned around. drove back pictures anyway and you took pictures. yeah if i was a cop. and and that happened yeah you wouldn't you were go. ahead yeah he didn't see. it no no freeze no. no i'm not i don't imagine freeze because he's naked. freeze put your dick. in the air uh yeah i mean. i used to. live downtown and dude the [ __ ] i've seen oh my god one time just one more time before we get into. this [ __ ] uh we like the banter. when i used to. smoke there was a [ __ ] crazy woman across the street there. was a little grassy park. across the street from my building. and and i walk out and i'm talking to. a friend of mine out. there and she [ __ ] surprises me. comes out of nowhere. and she just goes and i was like oh my [ __ ] god yeah and then i i'm looking at her. now because i didn't see her coming up. it was like she was a ninja yeah and but she's close as hell right. oh wow yeah there you go. close yeah and so and i said what she goes and i'm smoking. i realized okay she's playing here. and i say you want your cigarette. okay and she goes okay. i don't know what you're doing. you know so i kept talking to. my friend and then she starts. like doing this like kicking her feet up. like a bull like she's ready. to come at me and i'm like well. she's not gonna [ __ ] hurt me. right you know what i mean. so like whatever uh and now and i back up. enough to notice her. pants are around her. ankles and her [ __ ] all of her business. is just out loud and proud right. and then i'm like oh and i kind of step. back like just in shock yeah. yeah and then she gets like offended. that i step back. in check and she starts coming. like oh my god oh my god but she couldn't take big steps. because her feet were already. and i was like coming. back i was like stop stop yeah yeah yeah like laughing and it was just real. depressing i gave her a cigarette. though was it sexy it was real hot. we dated first dude. also you didn't really try to. get away if she couldn't take big steps. you could have just [ __ ] ran i was just slowly. back pedaling laughing i wanted it. you kind of wanted some i was enjoying. what you wanted to. get i was thinking about like telling you and telling people that no. no no no no oh no just in place. yeah yeah you take your pants. out too i can't go either um so maybe was it a center bite. could have been that woman though. yeah was filthy like layers of layers of layers of dirt. on her like the woman. the thing behind behind the dumpster and move. on drops wow dude. okay yeah all right. well let's get into. it that was a lot. of banter but we hope. you liked it we don't really care. but we had a good time. so let's go to. some lifeline in the news. guys here we go. matt why don't you read it. a man claiming to. be a russian astronaut in space. allegedly

you're taking it's taking so long. because the space is slow. that's the bullet oh all. right next one from the guardian. morning new york university oh i [ __ ] read about this new york university professor fired after students say his class was too hard that's great maitland jones jr a professor of organic. chemistry was fired by nyu. after more than 80. students from his 350 student course signed a petition. complaining about grades teaching and help. received during the covet. pandemic dude um the complaining about school. by students especially when it's about class. being too hard is the [ __ ] most annoying thing on top. of which the [ __ ] uh administration fired. his ass that's crazy. also it's nyu i know it's a it's a [ __ ] it's supposed. to be hard i know it's college. it's nyu and dude. it's like imagine if this was like a doctor like a doctor class. for [ __ ] med school it'd be like it's too hard. and then people just [ __ ] yeah exactly no that these people probably premed some of them i know the thing about this [ __ ] is like this is i've said this for a while dude the customer is always right mentality yeah is driving our society into. the [ __ ] ground yeah dude customers [ __ ] rarely right yeah dude the customers never right. yeah customer's never right so i think it's crazy. i think devices stay in school. and don't complain about it. or [ __ ] don't try to. get up these petitions are. [ __ ] annoying and [ __ ] so oh 80 people signed something yeah that's not even close to. half we'll sign something about the school. being too imagine being this. [ __ ] poor guy also if you don't want a thing to. be hard don't study organic. chemistries study like take clowning. in 101 or some [ __ ] dude. imagine this class is too. hard i'm going around here like dude. i i swear to. god i i really really really knew i was inside. a [ __ ] box and the guy said i wasn't inside a box and gave me a d and i think it's amazing. i mean check this. out dude yeah well nobody would fail. someone that does that yeah. [laughter] sign it did you did. you do clowning yeah yeah so hard. i didn't complain and now look dude. yeah now look at you yeah. this is where this is where not complaining. gets you folks yeah dude. look at this huh. what what is oh yeah. yeah okay great great. job all right all right uh what do we got new let's keep doing. these two videos now yeah new videos. people it's already 20 minutes. in the show you got people here we go. my babies hey chris and matt. huge fan of the pod. chris please come to. minneapolis i will so my question. revolves around college room. i live with two other girls. one who's very laid. back in little brother who's very sensitive and emotional um our sensitive roommate. is the type of person to. be offended and think everyone hates. her if she's not invited. to one little thing. um and so last week i went. to a hayride with my boyfriend. and his friends and invited. my laidback roommate because she's talking to. one of his friends and our sensitive roommate had plans. um and now she is flying. off the handle at me. for not inviting her slamming doors in our. apartment stomping around sending me nasty. text messages obviously so deeper. for her yeah um and i don't really know. how to handle it. because it's just an extremely hostile. place to live right. now um should i try and sit down talk. with her she's kind of the type of person. where you're damned if you do you're damned. if you don't um and so i'm just kind of like at a loss right. now i don't really know. what i should do or say. or if anything but thanks guys i really appreciate anything. i know what to. do victim mentality dude. i know what to. do she's invisible and nothing she does. can even make a sound anymore. so she just act like she's not even. [ __ ] there like it's not she's ready. to talk to. you about it slamming doors and making a [ __ ] scene yeah the others. just she's a ghost it's so hard. just so hard to. do though don't give it don't give an inch. you know you did nothing wrong. don't bend over for this. [ __ ] person that is clearly i don't know if she's spoiled. deeper yeah she's got issues. but who knows dude like she's still young. hopefully she'll figure it out. a lot of people do at that. age they're like such [ __ ] babies and all they want is attention. but uh you're not going to. do any favors by. giving like uh giving like credit. yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah the whole idea. of i i can't stand this. the whole idea of you have to. invite every friend to. everything you ever do or if you're a dick. is unreal sometimes i don't. want to invite david sullivan. oh i don't ever want to. invite this right because he's a [ __ ] guy who is just you know his skull. is physically big head he's a friend. with our of ours he looks like thomas jefferson no yeah he looks like the guy what was it the head. head the guy within it from mtv. so yeah dude i don't it's like yo. you just got to. be like i didn't i i invited. the chill laid back. friend because i wanted to. invite her you were busy. anyway and also i didn't want to. invite you also i wanted. to have a chill. laid back time not an uptight. yeah [ __ ] brat time yeah i i think honestly if if you you can have a conversation. one time with her and if this continues it's just going. to be one of those situations. where you gotta she's out. it sounds like she probably has tried. but to no avail. and if that's the case. no more yeah she's invisible. that's my advice to. you she is now invisible. okay yeah i mean you can do that. pretend like she's the others. yeah i am your adult. that's that's david i don't even. barely remember that you don't. remember that i kind of remember that. was this [ __ ] dude i loved it on call though. it looks just like david sullivan. yeah um so uh yeah but you don't have to. can fight all your [ __ ] friends imagine you have to. fight all your friends all the way i got four. tickets to the dodger. game i gotta [ __ ] i gotta do a mass text. at 35 people the first four. people like it's like do micro. machines guys but like i just i dude. it's so annoying because like you just you. invite who you want to. invite and that's okay. remember when you guys always okay. it's always okay to. invite whoever you want to. invite a year and a half. we were in the text. chain and a year and a half. you guys one of you. guys was like when are you coming. over and i was like oh what are you. guys doing on a game night. i was like oh really and like you said yeah. we do game night. every week i didn't even know. for a year and a half. you've been doing game night. i don't even know thank you. for knowing me that well. but like nobody would ever invite you. to a game night. yeah because it sucks. dude no because no because you suck. no and you don't play. games i know the truth again. oh i don't play games. where am i i don't mean. where am i you know. yeah i don't know somewhere where there's a rope. so uh so anyway dude. yeah i just you gotta she's gotta get to. step into it you move. or she moves you gotta get this. stuff and get a [ __ ] two bedroom with a chill friend i mean that's a bit much just ignore her i know but okay until i mean she could make her life a living hell i guess but she's not she's just she's throwing a tantrum okay yeah she keeps swinging tantrums. i'm just saying okay i remember if it doesn't say. much let's go to. the next one

early. 30s and i still live at home. with my parents and younger brother. the other night i was in bed. watching some naughty videos. i had my airpods connected of course. what i was completely. unaware of was that my phone. was also connected to. the bluetooth speaker in my all caps. parents bathroom i didn't know. your phone could be connected. neither did i do two. devices at once but apparently it. can crying clown face my regular face. oh regular crying face uh my mom. confronted me the next day. to ask if my phone. was hooked up to. the speaker and i checked and still unaware of the major atrocity. said oh yeah oops. it didn't hit me. until she said i noticed it. last night shock face. i want to. die i want to. fly to outer space and never. return i want to. change my identity and only wear wigs. from now on what do i do. do i leave it. at that do i confront her. about what exactly she heard. please help shoot me love. you now just honestly this the advice. i have is you didn't. do anything wrong no you didn't. you made a mistake by. having your parents hear that. [ __ ] but you didn't mean to. um but like the whole shame of it. is like you don't need to. feel that there's a very human. emotion but like you don't need to. feel that because honestly. it's just sex it's not even sex. it's i mean it's sex. but it's like naughty videos. and you're a [ __ ] grownup you know. yeah she says she's 30. right yeah yeah you know. you're 30. in your 30s. like you're a full ass adult. you can do whatever the [ __ ] your mom directly in her eyes. and say my bean. needed attention am i what. you look at your mom. right in the eyes and you like say. it like mr mr anderson. in the [ __ ] matrix okay my bean. needed attention what what are you. saying being my being needed attention. yeah what's that what looks like. a bean on your body. in between your legs. like a coffee bean. okay no no well it looks like a lentil. bean up top i don't. think it looks like it. looks like a coffee bean. the actual thing looks like a coffee. bean but i'm saying oh oh the lentil. bean up top lentil bean. oh okay there's a lentil. being on top of a coffee. bean if you know what i'm cutting. there's a big coffee bean. it's like a russian doll. of beans there's a there's a big coffee. bean but i'm saying actual sized lentil. being above the big coffee. bean that's the bean that needed attention. really because i got it. that was pleasure. ll bean okay so what you need to. do is realize that your mom. also needed to. attend to her being at some point uh that everyone in the world attends to. their beans that's why in all the old. ass [ __ ] religious texts it. says nobody is allowed. god said nobody's allowed. to play with their beans. yeah okay it should have. been everyone loved you know. it's okay to. attend to your beings. tender beans wow that's good. the 11th commandment and it's okay. to attend to your beans. you shall always attend to. your neighbor's beans all. the commandments have to. do with their neighbor you know. yeah yeah i know. that's so weird just make sure you are not. hooked up to. your neighbor's bluetooth as well. yeah only be hooked up. to your own bluetooth when it attend. when being attentive to. your being or just attending to. your beans right i think i got the language. right yeah i mean it. doesn't really matter because it's not real. but yeah okay anyway okay just own. it dude you [ __ ] attended to. your being and you got caught. i needed to. lightly move my being around. also what's with the mom yeah. i noticed like what a dick. dude she's just she got all pent up. she needs to [ __ ] hang with her. being a little bit dude. you should send her the video uh air. drop the video to. her and say yeah being attendance. is required yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that's true. being attendance required comma. mom yeah being attendance in the email. she sees this to. other people and gets she's just so bad. with technology oh no all. right yeah for sure. all right i'm gonna take a pure spectrum. gummies dude huh keeps me. levelheaded baby oh you know. it's always been one of my least. favorite things that you do. but you put something in your mouth. you go keep your love. ahead of babies [ __ ] [music]. pure spectrum cbd the link. is in the show notes go. down click it hit lifeline. for 10 off of all your cbd needs. my babies and also dude. let me tell you this. okay put it in the show. description because chris didn't er [ __ ] last week. yes dude all right let's do it. next one hey chris and matt. from new hampshire big fan. of the podcast thank you so my question. is what are your thoughts. on people putting their feet. uh at out car windows. as passengers i think it's completely. okay i love doing it. on back roads um it's kind of vibing. uh my brotherinlaw and i are in a debate. he thinks it's unacceptable um. and i think his only valid. argument is that it's a safety. concern um but i think you know you run. the risk of getting into. an accident every single time. you get into a. car anyways so why not just live. your best life and then just not be fearful. you're gonna get into. a car accident every single time. um i think he has an aversion to. feet he's not admitting to. uh in society i feel like feet. it's very divisive you. either fetishize them or you have like a strong. aversion to them and i think this question is kind of right. down the middle um i think it's fun. putting your feet out the window. chris am i not allowed in the log cabin. if i like putting my feet out the window. what do you guys. think you got to. be your true self but let me tell you something. there's a few things wrong. with it i have something to. say okay go ahead okay uh normally. i'd say do whatever the [ __ ] you want because that's what i say to. everything but honestly the safety. concern is real i was i was driving in my friends. i was in the passenger. seat of my friend's car this. is in high school. this is nick marquan's car well boy. nick farquief remember uh and my arm was out. the window just like doing. whatever the [ __ ] and i was telling him. a story and as i'm telling the story i i'm i'm articulating. with my hands and i bring my hand. and then just to. do something like that and right. when i bring my hand. in a car on foothill boulevard. a car was backing out. of a parking spot and just ripped. off his rear view. window and it was like a split. second after i brought my arm. in i remember so like of course do whatever. you want but when your foot gets knocked. off by a pickup truck backing out. on foothill boulevard i honestly. just love that country only it's only your fault. when your foot gets knocked off. on foothill boulevard while. someone's reversing yeah yeah. keep your hands inside. and get down take it down. keep your legs inside didn't. get down so shitty people either. have a virgin. to feed or they fetishize. them down by the way. people finish this feeder just niche. niched yeah yeah i get it. what i do is i put both out. i go in the center. farting i go in the center [ __ ] seat as i call it so uncomfortable and i go both out but here's the thing dude i think it is a safety. concern and i don't really like john may in high school. used to be like i don't. wear a seat belt i'm driving. if i die i die. you know what i mean. and it's like that's not no. dude so i you know it. is a safety concern you got to. be on the lookout. if you have the foot out you got to. be [ __ ] wary you know pull it in if a car is going to. hit it but also this. is the annoying thing doing it. when you're driving okay i understand. if you're flexible and you know. me do it i'm a flexible string. beam right so i drive and i keep it. out and i rested on the [ __ ] side mirror but i will tell you this if you're the backseat. it's annoying as [ __ ] because dude you're [ __ ] driving and then all you got the [ __ ] foot right there. so that's why if he has a version of feed. he looks at the foot it's right. there that's [ __ ] kind of annoying. it also you could think it's a little gross. exactly well if you have no i mean. she probably you know chicks. they don't wear they wear like flipflops. sometimes and [ __ ] i'll be so do guys yeah but no but chicks love to. do that kind of [ __ ] on like the back. road you know what i mean. the back road imagine a girl. wearing a closedtoed shoe on a back. road with a foot out there's no way. it never happened in the world. no they do because they don't get snake. bit no i said yes. they have boots but they put them. on out i'm telling you. dude the most casual women. love the casual [ __ ] dude. i said yes okay. okay uh and that's that okay. i just think may maybe do it. you know not so so much. maybe get it out the way. in a parked car if he has an aversion defeat. he thinks they're gross. you should listen to. him because that's just respectful. that's not his real if that's not his reason. then [ __ ] him keep your feet out the window wow. you laid the hammer. done huh yeah it's either or it's like the foot aversion. or fetish all right. okay i get it extreme one. way it is stop it is cool. that i can do that. though huh yes i mean. it's it's like fine it's kind of okay. it's on a cool side. it's on the cool side. yeah okay next hey matt. and chris my name is evan. from the sacramento area. nice guy and my question. is about hobbies so basically. i'm of the mindset that if i'm not immediately. good at something i'm not going. to continue pursuing it um and so that means that i don't have a lot. of things that i'm interested. in yeah so do you guys think that i should keep pursuing something. even though it's difficult. and i don't like it. immediately but i might find out. that i like it down. the line once i get good at it. or should i just cast a huge net. and just try a bunch of things. out and figure out what i'm immediately. good at pursue those things. uh let me know what you guys. think that's interesting i didn't. think that's what he was. going to say as a second. option it's a good question. um i would say because you're a person. you have tastes you have probably have a better. sense than we do about. what you might like yeah so if if you're bad or good. at something you take to. it right away or not do. you like the thing does it. seem like a lot of fun. if you were to. master it if that's the case. then stick with it even if you suck. it's not like to. me it's not either or it's like the opposite. of the previous question. there's so much fluctuation and possibility. here if you are good at. it or not if the thing. seems really really fun to. you and what your brain. likes and doesn't like but he's so apathetic. about [ __ ] he's saying you know he doesn't like that. many things because he feels he's not good. at things or but here's the other thing. but you get good at things. the more you do them. is my point i know but you also have to. look at it this are. you a perfectionist because like you know. i'm good at stand up. and like i i was good in the beginning. but if i go back and look at videos. of me it's terrible. it's interesting so like so like was i good. i mean technically no i remember you being good. but now when i watch videos of you. in the beginning i think you suck. no so now that would be rude. right but no no i know. you're joking but like i wanted. them to know okay that's sweet. of you but let's you know. it's okay i'm so upset. but yeah no i watched. video of me doing stand. up in the first six months. like after like years after i started straight. up open mic no it was a show. it's like one of those okay. and i was like oh my really i turned it. off i couldn't watch it. so like you know maybe don't be so hard. on yourself as my advice. yes that's good advice dude. that's always the best but don't be so hard. on yourself man and try some things. but don't this whole cast in a wide. net like people who. are like you know i want to. try and experience different things to. find out who i am those. people are [ __ ] weird as [ __ ] yeah i agree i agree like dude you kind of should know what you like already if you got hair on your face you should know a few things that you like yeah so it's like dude i don't know man don't be one of those dudes that's like yeah i gotta [ __ ] walk barefoot all the way to. you know what i mean. what's the deal with people. not wanting to do. things unless they're good at them. like that's that to. me is on the same. is that the same thing. but it's not the same. wavelength it's trying to. get a teacher fighter because the class is too hard. it's like the thing is the thing. you want to. be good at it work. yeah to being good. at it if it interests you keep working. at it you [ __ ] what are you just like only want to. do things that you're good. at that's so boring oh also there's a boring. person there's something to. be led said about like your life. leading you to something. that you like and like i have a buddy. who would like do a lot. of animation and it never really like got successful. off it but he loved you know. him but he does. like a lot of animation yeah yeah and not not your friend. no i know so and um and he never really got he was very. good at it never made. a career out of it. and now he like he's always liked movies. and [ __ ] and now he likes to. like he makes these like prints. of like themed old newspaper like i could say. like 90s horror movies. and he's got a bunch of newspaper articles. like for scream [ __ ] friday 13th. or whatever and he makes them. and you could get him framed. and like he makes prints of them and sells them. dude and he loves doing it. and he's like it took me a while to. find out my passion but this is awesome. people pay me to. do this [ __ ] i love doing it and i'm happy and if this guy was out here trying [ __ ] racquetball and rock climbing it would have taken even longer to. him to get to. this [ __ ] thing it's so time consuming too yeah you got it home. yeah things you might like right. not just all things right. right yeah anyway yeah so that's what's up. i think yeah don't be so hard. on yourself yeah next one. yeah what's happening to. live brothers my question is about friendship. basically when i grow short. i had to make a decision. to get the vaccine make a move. in my place of work to. and try and increase my money. because i just got engaged a year. ago nice congratulations um and also have two. uh daughters all right so you know. times you're getting they were getting. a little rough for me. um new york has been rough with the whole. pandemic stuff yeah especially in the service. industry is where i work. so yeah anyways um so a friend. of mine basically implied and believed that. getting the vaccine was like getting. an std like hiv and the vials. and you know all kinds of crazy. [ __ ] and you know he basically took me off everything and basically ghosted. me and him and his bro. were supposed to. be in my wedding and i just i've tried to. try i've wanted to. take the high road but i just don't know. what to do you know. so would love to. know how one would handle. this because he got the vaccine his friend won't talk. to him anymore is that what he said that's okay. that's crazy here's the thing. about the vaccine in the pandemic. in general we know this firsthand. and i know of many if not almost all people probably. have some degree of this. in their life firsthand the pandemic. drove so many people off the deep end and it. was a real like glimpse into. how many people just in general. on any given day any given moment in time. how many people are right. there on the cusp of losing their [ __ ] minds. and all they need is a little push and that. pandemic was that little push and some people just [ __ ] lose their minds. and they're gone forever. little push that's why they say don't push me we have one. of their [ __ ] to. try to tie in your own. [ __ ] yeah but we have one of our greatest friends in the world that this happened to. i know so many people with their own. stories like this and dude. that's what happened to. your [ __ ] friend yeah he they it's like they use their minds. and they're just now they're [ __ ] different people yeah it sucks the amount of time. the amount of time. that i like spent trying. to like be friends. and make sure that these kinds of people were okay. it's just like round here. it's always on my mind. that's what you know. what i mean i know. i know around here okay. because he looked at the guy. in counting crow counting crows. adam duritz or whatever the [ __ ] his name is dude adam dirt. it's always on my mind. when i was in college. adam doors tried to. [ __ ] my girlfriend so many times so many different ways. oh my god i bet that. was a long december. yeah that's crazy dude yeah i'd love to. [ __ ] yeah even though you have a boyfriend round. volunteer yeah yeah yeah stop okay yeah yeah but i could be in the crowning crows. yeah yeah i guess i mean didn't want. one time he he [ __ ] actually i'm completely making that up oh well it sounds good sounded good um um no but i i yeah it's not that sucks bro. but advice if there is any is that. try to get definitely take no. responsibility for this yourself this is all on those. other people and try to. get used to. the fact that the pandemic. this has happened to. one in one way or another. to everyone all the same. people have been touched one. way or another by the crazy. people in ways like this. and you're not alone. you strong everyone who you're not alone. uh you so many people have been through. this okay you should honestly. if you're looking at it in the life. rips way i always say. life rips go [ __ ] thank the pandemic. go thank the pandemic for cutting. these people out of your life. in a quicker fashion than it. would have if that if if this virus didn't. exist dude yeah so it would have been something. if it wasn't this yeah it would have been something. and it would have taken. longer it would have caused you. more stress i get that the stress is palpable now but go outside. and say thank you coven. wow if you have a friend that has i'm telling you. to do it too film. it send it in go. outside and say covid. think get on your knees. like brendan [ __ ] frazier in school. ties wait till it. rains thank you coleman wow. wow that's a good movie do that. [ __ ] man because it's like [ __ ] it yo the you cut hey covid did you make any did you did you [ __ ] my friends up or did you [ __ ] expose my enemies thank you covered how much would you have [ __ ] how much would it have sucked if this guy was in your wedding and then afterwards or some other [ __ ] happened and then you would have had these pictures and you would have been looking at them all lonely just like one more night in hollywood right so get out there and go thank you for exposing my enemies. coming well such a crazy person. like if you saw someone do that. thank you for exposing my enemies. covid lifeline listener huh. anybody that says exposing my enemies. in general is a [ __ ] absolute nutcase. completely disagree dude that's why. me and tupac are on the same. team and you're on the [ __ ] different side okay okay okay now let's move on we got a facebook. minecraft seeing a new guy. a couple months ago. i'm 33 and uh things. have been going great except for the fact. that the last few times we've. had sex he has lost his erection. like midsex um obviously initially i thought oh gosh. she's not attracted to. me he swears up and down that's not it. um that just biologically this. happens sometimes to men which i totally. understand however i you know my needs aren't being met. so i would was wondering how do i bring this. up to him to. maybe get this resolved um i don't want to. emasculate him i want to. support him and um i really care. about him so i don't want to. hurt his feelings so how would you suggest. i bring this up. to him it's a new relationship. should i be concerned thanks. guys it's a little alarm. that's happening that it's a little loving. what that mouth do that that's happening. so early in a relationship yeah but get [ __ ] viagra yeah but also what that mouth. do and what exactly does. this mean well you know if he's getting soft. in the middle of doing the horizontal. mambo yeah you turn to. him and you say what that. mouth do and then what does. that mean let's see how it works. yeah and and yeah that's definitely true. yeah yeah okay yeah so but so but also i let me say. this dude if i'm really into. uh a woman right. like this has happened my whole life. if i'm really into. her it's more of a thing. and it's uh more stress or pressure. for me to perform. well and then i get inside. my head yeah and that could happen. to me deeper. now i have intimacy issues. nice to meet you intimacy. let's have issues together but you know i you know that. that does happen so i would trust. him and give him the benefit of that. it is not you right. i can even tell with your pixely. face it's not you right. but um but yeah maybe kind of like right. like just it's it's a tough thing. to bring up but maybe kind of just gently turn over. to them after you have sex. one time and just be like sweetie. what what that mouth do. you know or say like how's your tongue. game or whatever the [ __ ] you know what i mean anyway i think what you should do is you're not gonna you want to. lap it up you're not gonna masculate. them if you came at him. the way you just describe i'm. talking about oops right. how's the tongue game though. like this with the covers. just like this can you lap it up. so gross though lap it up. like a [ __ ] dog yeah i've got a dog bowl in between my legs stupid what's up doberman. i got a [ __ ] vanilla bean. between my legs oh yeah um no. i think first of all that's a good. idea this is his erection. he can still go down on you he still has a mouth. he has other ways of making you. uh give bringing delivering pleasure. to you robot um but i also think that you're not gonna. necessarily masculate him he knows. what's happening he knows you know. what's happening all you got to. do is like mention it. it's like the more you don't mention. it the weirder it gets. yeah but bring it up. maybe it happens to. him maybe it's something. that has happened to. him in the past it's a recurring. thing not talking about it. at all is a surefire way. to get it all [ __ ] up yeah you'll get it all [ __ ] up and you won't even get hard in the beginning you'll just be like viagra trying to. shoehorn it in viagra is an option. for sure uh there are other more natural. ways of trying to. keep an erection uh but yeah definitely have him. start going down on you because if he's losing his [ __ ] heart on what up. you ought to. go down you got to. go down south well make her still happy. like one of my favorite. things is to. see what a guy's mouth game. is like so maybe we can get into. that and maybe don't mention the [ __ ] soft. [ __ ] you know what am i you know one of my favorite. things is two of my favorite. things honestly badminton and seeing what other guy's mouth. game is did you want to. try any of those i have rackets but also what kind of guy. loses his heart on and isn't like let me attempt at doing the mouth. game i mean probably many guys he's probably insecure. about trying a mouth game maybe maybe his mouth. maybe he didn't do it. yet we don't know how new it. is right if it's if it's like it. you know if it's like two or three. times or you know it's just a new. relationship so maybe if they're exclusive it's been a bit but yeah and also maybe it's the condom. maybe you know some guys. can't do it with the comments. that's true but you know. he would have said that. if that she would have said that. if that was the case. everybody's got a little dirt. bag in them all right. okay but uh yeah dude tell him. to go down on you [ __ ] full stop end of story end. of sentences in a paragraph. end of [ __ ] short story and a collection of short. stories and a book and a book. binding that's the dumbest thing i've ever heard dude. all right okay next one. matthew modine so i was in band. of brothers what do i do. if what's up man. chris so i got a little situation. here it's gonna be so bad. i'm currently talking to. this girl that i work with nothing. i know bad idea but the problem. is i'm 23.31 okay okay outside. of that we get along. really well and everything's going pretty smoothly. we've only been talking like three or four. months but recently she's been talking. about wanting to. have a kid oh my god now. i probably don't want to. have a kid until you know. a good 10 years. probably but i don't think she's willing to. wait 10 years i mean. who the [ __ ] is you know. would that would that means should i cut things. off sweetie should i keep just going. with the flow and see where things head. i don't know we work together. so that could stir up. some stuff in the already did. bro yeah i mean i doubt. it she's a sweetheart. but uh could be yeah just let me. know what you guys think. also they haven't even had sex yet. and she's already talking about having kids. no they have it's been a few. months run oh yeah i thought he said they were texting. for a few months oh. no no it's been happening. for a few months okay. well then they're already bro. you already made the mistake. so [ __ ] whatever at this point but um i mean you have a lot of money because you're in cutthroat. island but uh yeah i don't know. it's great in full metal. jacket i think that that was the one. i was trying to. think of so uh i think that i mean. you know you can't be like how's 41. sound as a mother. you know she would literally her. head would explode yeah. can you just wait 10. years props to her. yeah props to. her for being up front though. yeah for sure yeah that's absolutely true. so she was up front to. you so you should be up. front of her i think no. you owe her that exactly so just say like yo. i'm not gonna want kids. for another 10 years. you want to. ride this out or not. i totally get it. but also uh it's probably best. if you guys just don't keep it. a cat if you keep it. okay but let me tell you something. for real this guy thinks i don't want kids. for another 10 years. you don't know you don't know. yeah you don't know. in two years you could change your mind. in 10 years you. could still not want kids there's no right. way to approximate. when you think you will want children. when you think you you know. you'll be ready there's no way. to know in fact you might not. ever be ready and then you might have a kid. and the day it comes. you think oh my god i'm so ready. i can't [ __ ] wait for this. these things are not knowable so get that. part out of your [ __ ] mind if you really are into. this woman and she's really into. you and you guys agree. to not let it [ __ ] up the workplace. you already started doing it. you might as well see it. through the end to. cut it now and be like no no. we work together you. already dipped a toe and you're [ __ ] that's true. good point what a good. feeling man so just keep going. be a good guy. be upfront with her like she has been with you and be [ __ ] honest and see where it goes yeah i agree good good job dude good good good good uh what do you call it it's called advice okay hey what's up guys it's alex from boston um i just hit record and i took a turn and now i'm staring directly at the sun or anything but um my question is basically uh i have a new job and it's work from home. forever remote and my lease. is going to end. in june and i basically have the opportunity. to work from anywhere. and i can't decide where to. go so i figured i'd ask you guys. chris you travel a lot. um matt i'm sure you've done some traveling. so i'm just curious within the us or maybe even europe. if you could work from a home. office anywhere wow where would you. do it
