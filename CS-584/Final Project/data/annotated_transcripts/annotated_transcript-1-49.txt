who uh got charged with murdering. tupac the man who the man. who is a former gang. leader so that dude do you understand. i think about tupac every day. for since 1996 so that's crazy. you know i love tupac. right you know i'm the kind of guy. who absolutely loves tupac dude. rude but we love tupac. um so uh and so um isn't this crazy. dude this is 30. years later 30 years later. and the man is charged a man. is charged with murder in. the tx sh cour. case the man a former gang. leader named dwayne keith. davis um all honestly terrible names. if i'm being honest dwayne keith. and davis the four he has said the four shots. that killed the rapper 196 came. from the vehicle he was riding in incriminated. himself um was on a podcast. incriminating himself also wrote a book. about it incriminated himself. um more than 25 years. after the killing of tupac. shore became a defining tragedy. in hipop this is from the new york. times uh the man dway k. has said in interviews. and a memoir that he was in front in the front passenger. seat of the white cadillac. that pulled up near the vehicle. holding mr shakur uh after 1996. um shot four times and died. in a hospital so okay so he said he did. so why'd he do that. hm bad crook um. the worst crook of all time. did you do it yes. clink ah [ __ ] um this is pretty crazy uh i don't despite the plentiful speculation and evidence and reporting across nearly three decades no charge of field this is crazy bro yo he changed history do you know what i mean if he did it he admitted it but if he did it but you know he admitted it but it's like um in 2019 memoir mr davis who goes by the name keith. d worse name um the only the only way. to make the name keith. worse is to. call yourself keith it's like calvin would say it ke uh recounted. a gang dispute that escalated. after mr shur andis beat up. mr davis's nephew okay so see i knew that this was part. of it i've watched. all the documentaries on. it all of them. dude and i knew it. was somebody who had something to. do with the fight dude. i'm a detective [ __ ] yeah man i ain't got no mother. i know this stuff i'm smart. okay and i knew it. was something to do. with that [ __ ] it's too bad. i didn't work for the police man. if i did dude god we would have [ __ ] nipped this. in the bud a year or two later. mother so rude to. start a song like that but okay. um he said them. jumping on my nephew gave us the ultimate. green light to do. something h sir. incriminating dude mr davis said in the memoir compton street legend. tupac chose the wrong game. to play i mean dude. you know that's weird. dude gangsters just think. that they are gangster than now. you know what i mean. more gangsteryoutube you know what i mean. ain't nobody bigger than the streets dog. ain't nobody bigger ain't nobody better than the streets. ain't nobody better than the hood you. ever see those like you know documentaries. or like the the the what do you call. not necessarily the documentaries. but the um well i guess so the docu serieses or something. like gangland or something and they just have a guy. on camera and he's just like yo. hell yeah i killed. 12 people when i used to. roll with them you know what i mean. um [ __ ] i was the muscle [ __ ] had to. get dealt with you know and it's just like hey get them you know i don't understand. hey hey hey ho hey get him dude. hey documentarian call 911 hey boom guy call the police hey craft service call the authorities hey hey grip tell the media hey get him you know i mean back in the when i was in the rolling crips or something is that a thing i basically um killed nine people dog it's this people here's a list shows these are their pictures you know what i mean and then it's just like onis discovery. hey producers get them. you know what i mean. i don't know it's crazy. it's pretty crazy um so anyway. they're gonna get this guy ah this. guy i don't know um mr. davis said avoided directly naming. the person who opened fire. in recent interviews um but in a tape. confession released by the former. lapd detective who investigated mr. uh dr mr davis told said it. had been mr anderson. his nephew who was known. by baby lane see i knew. this i i read about this. already i saw the documentary. mr anderson was questioned by. officers in 1998 but then he died. right i think mr anderson. died um and his m mr. davis who has also been known. as kei d said that. after the shooting the men abandoned the car. and walked back to. the hotel picking the vehicle. up and uh okay i mean. this guy just basically said wow. okay so did it anyway. got him this is like when r kelly. sang that song i admitted i did. it and it wasn't about that. but it was actually about that. you know um this is a wild. thing man i can't believe that. that's i can't believe that. that's done all right cool. well it's such a crazy time. dude my wife wants to. go see that movie the creator and i'm just like okay. fine but it's gonna i knew it. was going to bomb dude. just like barbie and uh denzel washington uh who is in it. whatever his name is marty. washington and um he's jewish and um marty washington ste and so he's in it. and like ai is tripping. people out i think a bomb. because people are scar eric. griffin said this people are scared. of ai and i think that it's true. i think it's real it's kind of weird. that we're seeing it. and we're like we don't want to. go see it remember when monster. movies were big because everyone thought the world. was going to end or some [ __ ] i read. a thing on it. i don't know i'm an idiot. but like they were like they were like monster. movies are big because of the fear in america. that and and all across the world. that is happening because of something. i saw a [ __ ] article or read. a [ __ ] thing or saw a documentary and [ __ ] and now and that's what they said basically and so now it's like everyone's scared of ai but the ai movies aren't popping because that [ __ ] is really real there are no monsters it's not a way to. get away and relieve yourself. of the fear it's a way. to go and see oh this. is really what's happening. now well isn't that crazy. dude um and somei use is for good. and uh you know i guess. it's like you get to. learn stuff and and uh like we got one of those uh lg standby me big tablet things. and calvin just plays the games. on that it's crazy they're pretty. wild but uh and then you got uh tom hanks says that. it's not really him selling. dental insurance and instagram ads. you know hey we know. unless it's in japan dude. i if you go to. italy you will see straight. up tom hardy doing a [ __ ] uh like a an ad. for a restaurant he'll just be like yeah. i py me a [ __ ] bag. for it here look here's the here's the here's the dental. insurance thing here tom tom hanks beware. there's a video out there. promoting some dental plan. with an ai version of me. i have nothing to. do with it tom hanks signs. everything you know um so let me see it. can't find it wow. dude that's crazy can't find it because that's how strong. he is that's how strong. tom hanks is it's so obviously. not him bro he's like so handsome. and his teeth are [ __ ] killing. it you can't do comments. on tom hanks uh instagram. because every you know. there's like [ __ ] 10% of people on reddit thinks he eats kids so he had to. had to shut that down. so it's all good yeah. he doesn't eat kids so um it's anyway. it's not him dude. false alarm oh man. i wish this kind of [ __ ] happened to. me about how like fake dental ads. but anyway some ai is good and some eyes. is bad and this is bad. they're g to. sue him dude you know you can't. use someone's like likeness for a [ __ ] grill you can't. use someone's likeness for a teeth. cleaning dude for anything really for that. matter dude people are going to. get so sued this. ai [ __ ] i can't even believe it. the laws won't be able. to catch up too you're going. to sue they're going to. sue you for ai [ __ ] you're going to. go to court and there's going to. be already by then there's going to. be ai lawyers and we're going. to be there and it's going. to be like an ai. judge and everyone's just all [ __ ] and they're just going. to they're going to. sue you uh uh monetarily and you're going. to pay with crypto. so it's like nothing ever happened. anyway tom hanks isn't that that's not him. um but i do love how technology. has just tak over i saw i saw on hoda and whatever. it is now it hoda and yoda whatever. the [ __ ] the news new good. morning america it's hoden somebody used to. be hoden kathy leah hoden and [ __ ] uh lance. bass and neil degrass tyson. i don't know who the [ __ ] it is but um good morning. uh good morning. and welcome to. yo hoda and ne. tyson we're on billions of channels billions. and billions of syndicated um who is it. hold i thought you said something. j hod and jeda bush. no clue um the today. show okay so anyway they were like i just calvin. all of a sudden took the remote and just goes press. it's so loud and it's on and it's on the good. morning today show with hoda and yoda and and uh she's just like beyonce is it. was her and another woman and then a a gay. black guy and it was like beyonce if he's not gay. he needs to. change the way he talks. but he's gay and so um they were like beyonce has a documentary coming out. in theaters and and then one of the [ __ ] hoda girls was like i saw her posted. on instagram and i watched it. over and over and over and over again. and it's like first of all crazy. that there's news about beyonce. posting something sec it. goes from the documentary about what's the movie's. about to now. the today's show is just talking about. what beyonce posted and then it's like hey. howa they didn't watch. it over and over again. you watched it once you watched. almost the whole thing once you know. what i'm talking about and you didn't watch. it over and over again. and that's fine and then they like if beyonce uh is if this is in theaters. and then the gay black guy. was like uh um bieber's. movie made $99 million when it. came out nobody knew that was going. to beyonce could actually surpass that we're talking $300. million the guy's just talking out. of his ass and i'm sitting here watching the thing. and i'm seething dude. i just get to. seething man calvin had no idea when he hit that button that was going to. get to see then cuz what the [ __ ] dude hey guys i want to. be like get a job but this is their job. they're doing this [ __ ] and they got people outside the window in the back. just like that [ __ ] thing you know whatever like trl. started it and now it's got it all the [ __ ] everyone's in the back. just they know it's not. news they know it's not. even worth talking about because they got people in the back. distracting you from it they don't. even give a [ __ ] how has nobody flashed to. them by the way. ever nobody's taken their penis. out nobody's turned around opened up and showed them the you know sarlac pit nobody um anyway dude uh so i'm watching this and i get to. see then then i turn it off. and it's okay because calin wanted to. watch big giant pacman. on youtube is what he called. it and so we did we watch that. that's much better than hoda and no. don't disrespect hoda you know. even though i disrespected her. for about you know 6. minutes so far um but so it's just crazy. to me how pervasive i guess. or omnipresent god god and i only got an 1100 on my sats but um and this was back when you could only get 6 i. think you get like 25,000. now or something but um so so now i'm like oh crazy. how much like inundated we are god damn it. and only 1110 on the sats uh um but i'm firing out. three crazy words like i don't like you know. i obviously learned stuff since the sat. but i'm just saying that's just incredible. but anyway i get this thing that's like now. everyone's phone alarm will go off at 2:20. p.m. eastern time on wednesday. now that was either. that's either today if you're on the patreon. patreon dot com citalia or you get it. late that was yesterday. now you didn't know it. was going to happen i didn't know. it was going to. happen until i did know it. was going to happen i did. know it was going to. happen because the news. uh vetting here at congratulations. studios at super good studios is ab incredible. and you know this came hot. off the presses it was like hey dude we got this just in you might want. to talk about it and i was like i don't think i want to. talk about then i did want to. talk about it because it's like dude. everyone's phone's gonna go off. and so um so i'm thinking oh this. is crazy wild right. and i'm like reading about it. if you hear a screeching alert. go off in your cell. phone and everyone else is this. is by cnn so you know it's true. cuz cnn has absolutely never lied. in the world right till every day. so um the federal government said it will conu conduct conduct wh on wednesday afternoon a nationwide test of you know this and [ __ ] anyway the purpose is to. ensure that the systems continue to. be effective means of warning public. emergency whatever they want to. test it you know. we get why you understand. you only you're ding bad if you don't and then it so i texted to. my mommy and she says straight. up i say why everyone's phone. will alarm i sent her. the article she writes i doubt. it huh like just straight up just probably didn't even read it. just negating what i'm i'm trying to. help her out she
