i say something. that might sound rude like oh is that a size too. small yeah it disarms you. honestly you just sound like an evil. villain no but what people get less. offended when you say something. offensive and then you sound very cute. at the end of that. like oh that [ __ ] hat looks bad. on you i gave you herpes. i mean wow you know. well that's not offensive though. that is very offensive. oh wow that'd probably be the worst. thing to ever say to. somebody especially if you did if it wasn't a lie. and you weren't and it was true. i got the lifeline sweater. on the crew neck

does this and cheyenne. because they're always hunting. that's the most [ __ ] hunting. of all time like this. no it's like this okay. dear now i'm hunting. i mean the worst play. the worst play so um deer hunter. dear um yeah dude okay if you have a question go to. the description below or click. uh or go to. watch lifeline dot com okay so look man. so now why okay am i sweating. so much because i don't know because honestly i'm not sweating. that much so it i probably have a thyroid problem. is the answer it all. has to do with what. i don't know because sometimes you're you know. what i mean like it. could be the same. temperature one day you're good one. day the next day same temperature. and you're sweating the most. the most fluctuation of body. heat body temperature is me that's poetry. the wrongest way to. say that but you know what i meant. yeah um no i don't actually know. what you meant so my body. temperature fluctuates more than anyone in the universe. that doesn't have a thyroid problem. do you have a thyroid problem. i don't know so you might i might but i don't know. if i do so i can't say that. i do so i don't have one. okay so that's uh well i'm sorry. you know and if it gets hot. we can take a break. we've done that before you're sweating. you're perspiring if i stay still i sweat. less yeah that's par for the course um don't make me move. so my neck hurts there. i said it yeah you're moving. like batman you're doing this. yeah i i know it. really hurts and it didn't hurt. when i woke up which is crazy. usually when your neck. hurts it hurts from when you wake up. right or you pull it. you know what happened dude. do you know what happened. i have a guess but go ahead. okay go ahead guess probably nothing absolutely nothing. yeah i'm sitting there holding calvin we're having a great. time i'm sitting i'm not even. standing i'm not moving well you were. holding cow and you were exerting summons. no no oh okay he was literally. laying on me oh like this. oh laying down and all of a sudden my neck. just decides to. go like this and i'm in extreme. pain so now what was an explosion. the pain oh it was the pain. rate that's the pain rate in. here and does it go. like this no look at throbs or just it's one. extended pain nope it. goes and then congeals and it stays there. and it's always there the pain. congeals so that's great so now. i pick poetry so now. i have pain radiates the pain. congeals worst doctor so now when i when i move my. neck it hurts very badly and i'm so excited. about that dude that's so [ __ ] awesome. has that been an ongoing thing. with you that area. of your neck nope never so. now that i'm 42 that just may be something. that hurts all this probably but my my back. got better my back. it was my neck. my back my my [ __ ] and my crack and then my neck. got better uh i'm sorry. my back got better though. what happened with your [ __ ] we closed. up yeah it got really dry disgusting. um so anyway let's but but my point. is my back got better. i [ __ ] had to. go and get a procedure. and they give me cortisone. in my back dude you didn't know. that let's talk about cortisone. let's talk about how there's more salesman. let's talk about how there's literally nothing better. than a shot of quarters. is that really did it. really work that well i one time. had my throat was it was. when i was really sick oh yeah. my throat was closing. closing closing and it hurt. so bad to. swallow it probably hurt more. than when women have a baby. come out of their vagina. no wow did the doctor say that. the arizona by the way. now now yeah it might be the fan. in the bathroom oh the fan. right i don't like that i gotta be honest. it makes me feel very uncomfortable. when you do that it. might honestly might be the fan. of the bathroom okay and so it. could be this fan right. here yeah okay cool my throat. was closing right he said take off. your pants and bend over and you got a cortisone. shot you got this nurse. got a cortisone shot. he didn't do it okay. his female nurse did and she injected. it into my ass. cheek and i felt so terrible. when i was going. to the doctor yeah by the time. i was at the elevator to. go down with four flights from the doctor's office. yeah i felt so good. i was like i'm gonna take the [ __ ] stairs. and i ran down the stairs. and i was like all i wanna. do is boom boom matt yo. i don't want you to. be doing a melody would you call. it a mix of songs medley. medley medley medley that's what i was trying. to say but i'm the king of the medley. and everybody that's fine but my question. is they gave you a cortisone. shot in your butt for. your mouth dude yes went to. the wrong doctor no it wasn't it. wasn't obviously it wasn't local. but it just i went to. where it needs to. go some drugs go to. where it needs but then how come they gave. me a cortisone shot. in in where it hurts. in my back probably because here's what i'm going. to say oh and it's and it's probably it's probably. true oh has no idea because it's different. [music] the thing i guess obviously a doctor knows. what he's doing he's like dude. they put me like take off your pants. and bend over just because he he's a that's a he's not a priest you know. what i'm saying they bet they they put me. on a gurney i guess. face down injected me with numbing. [ __ ] and then injected my my uh back with cortisone. i mean that's almost like how big was the needle. big i was like i'm not looking it's like a spinal tap no it wasn't that i know but it's like why would they do it like that uh i don't know but my back felt [ __ ] fantastic. for one day and then but they said this. could last for a year. or one day literally oh dude. and i was like okay. cool of course lasted for one. day and then and then it got better. over time and i don't think it. was the cortisone i think. it was just my body. healing steroids are a crap. shoot they're steroids so that's why. you can't get a lot. of them right exactly because they'll leave a dimple in your [ __ ] too that's what they said they said that's why. they did it in my butt. though they were like because it might leave a dimple we don't want to. do it anywhere locally. because then you'll look like the [ __ ] uh uh the joker or some [ __ ] yeah i wanted to. or they should do it. on the tip of my nose. maybe make it a little smaller. well then you just be like a butt. nose i could afford to. lose some for my cup. you know what i mean. that's why i said i was like oh well my [ __ ] is so giant. do you want to. put it onto. that and then i took my [ __ ] out and i was like see do you see what i'm talking about. the doctors are no then i got sick. now i got sued okay. cool um yeah so my neck. [ __ ] hurts so bad and that's great and what what maladies do you have uh i'm too sweaty. right now yeah um my uh sleep's been extremely [ __ ] up. oh really oh yeah mine's been and i've been having a very. [ __ ] up nightmares that are crazy big adventures where i go to. try to save someone. and instead of saving. them i act i actually in fact. lead directly to their death. that is just you know. so it's all good that's fantastic. yeah it's just beautiful. man it's gorgeous i have the worst. dreams when i go to. sleep and then wake up. at 8 30 p.m and then sleep. more if i from wake up. sorry 8 30 a.m okay if i sleep. in the morning my body. goes like this will terrorize you yeah yeah it will terrorize it but you mean if you go back to. sleep did you want to. see what your dad would look. like with no eyes i'll close. up here we go. but you're saying when you go back. okay it's because when you sleep. for shorter periods of time. the dream you know. it doesn't get to. go deep enough into. your mind for you to. like it's too close. to your memory is what i'm saying. when you sleep for a short. period of time because you don't go to. a deep enough sleep. it's like more of an actual memory and you can remember it. way better when you wake up. oh i know oh wow. the only time anybody's ever said that. oh and then i know dude. uh well you know what dude. we should get into. it man you know we've gotta we've got a lot. of really great callers. probably and uh backtracked let's see what's up. dude let's go to. our first time it's hannah. here you guys helped. me with the coworker. who had horrible stories oh i have another advice is request for you currently in teachers college. i'm going to be teaching high. school students science and people have been starting. to tell me that i should be worried. about how the boys. in my classes are going to. flirt with me which i did. not think about until people started. it seems to. be the only thing that people are mentioning every time oh i'm not going. to be teaching high school. students they say that the boys. are going to. flirt with me so now i'm starting. to panic because i have no. idea what i'm gonna do um so do you guys. have any advice for how i can kind of deflect. and spin move away when or if my students. try to hit on me. hopefully as a joke. but nonetheless you she's saying that. here's the thing she's saying that. though people are telling her. that because she's pretty they're being pervy. they're like you know they're gonna get hit on if she was some frumpy. fat chick nobody would [ __ ] say that. sure relax what about. the [ __ ] why is that why you said frumpy fat chick. why she's not that it. hurt my feelings is why. she's not that she's not but people are and some people heard that. and they're like ah [ __ ] i'm not calling anyone frumpy. or fat i'm look fat. is a word that means that if we went over. it then some people are that we actually have an episode. titled fat frumpy two okay. well that is the rude. part because it implies but there are people who are frumpy. and fat yeah okay. anyway let's move on and her. question isn't about that either. so her question is what do. i do if this happens. and i'll tell you the person you're just saying i'm hot. oh no okay i'll tell you what. you do and it's a little slightly counterintuitive. but i'll explain why. you'd have to do it. this way okay there obviously you want. to put an end to. it yes but you cannot say. something in response. that will make it that. will make other students. laugh yeah or will make the student. who said it think he's like being a class. clown and getting attention for it. because that'll only nothing will make him. do it more other than you. just like turning around and sucking. his dick you know. i mean like if it the only thing. the only thing that would make him do it. more is if like it it. worked is what i'm saying. yeah which obviously won't work. so short of that. the only thing that you could do to. make it more to. embolden students to. do it more is if like you said something. that either was funny in itself. even as like a clap. back you don't want to. engage with it at all. don't do a clap. back yeah just just either completely ignore. it or say i'm going. to report you to. the principal and then actually do it. okay don't egg it on. in any [ __ ] way don't clap back. even though it's obviously going. to be tempting especially if it's a [ __ ] offensive thing. to say yep don't don't slide. into that though like please don't you'll do yourself. a favor by just meeting it. headon [ __ ] doctor strange style stop it yeah that's what doctor strange what if she did do that just stop it that's what doctor strange. i know he goes he goes. like this he goes. stop it trying to. do the circle right. the portal um i think that honestly. you you if you did that and you went. and she went to. the [ __ ] principal and the principal. was like he what if i mean. he might be like well it's probably because you're not a frumpy. fat chick well then then she would sue. that guy and get rich. why him because he's saying you are not a frumpy. fan because he's sexualizing her. and defending the students saying. you're not if the principal. said well it's because you're not a frumpy. fat chick he would be sexualizing. her or contributing to. that and you should get [ __ ] fired that's because you're not a frumpy what is this. i'm blowing his glasses. oh wow like a principle um yeah. no i know i'm kidding uh. honestly i think maybe uh just ignore. it completely and be like hey um just you know. all right cool yeah let's get the homework done. you know or whatever. the [ __ ] but look at this. 181 teachers charged with sex. crimes during first half. of 2022. this is why you can't. say anything in return either it's another reason. you only either say nothing and report it. or say i'm gonna report it. and then report it you don't clap. back you don't say something. smarmy in return about the student's appearance or his. youth nothing okay you [ __ ] the line is so [ __ ] thin now everybody freaks the [ __ ] out about everything especially in classrooms don't slide that slippery slope you'll go worst ted talk so i feel yeah no i feel like yeah just that's it but also sometimes they're [ __ ] kind of the billboard is that matt dylan i mean nobody it could be no it's not oh my god [ __ ] yeah i made up for the leo dicaprio ones from wild things yep um all right so i think uh i think that also what was different about her she did have a different hair color. or something if i remember correct she. looked like a different person. to me wow she didn't look. grumpy in fact well she had her hair up. and had glasses on i don't think she did. the first time all right. well let's do uh the next. one okay but yeah we figured that. out for sure take it off pause. it i don't like when hair peeks out. of the hat that's why it's fine. but if it's like that like like an actual garden. growing under his hat take it. out it's like it never it looks like chia pet like he just [ __ ] puts the hat on and then smears that [ __ ] stuff and then waters it and then and then the hat stays there and it grows out a little bit like this is the time lapse like that right but he's trying to. also hide his chia pet because it's poking out from underneath. right also pubes pubes for sure 100. cubes on his head. yeah like there should be a dick. on his forehead yeah and there is and that's why. he's wearing a hockey he's hiding. it 100 all right cool. and so he figures out so let's do that. right now what i don't like is. that we've told chris to. make it so we can pause it. and it doesn't start over. now didn't we we did and what does it. not do when we talked about it. when did we say that. we said that a while. ago i did okay. so you could go from there. yeah let's see uh big. fans of you both actually um have been for a long. time matt obviously got to. you a little late in the game. chris been a long time. fan of you for a long. [ __ ] time through thick and thin baby so i need some advice so my name is river. and that's pretty different nickname. at least around here you know. like i'm thankful for it. my whole life i'm 24. i have dealt with you. know like the jokes. on my name so um which is cool. like i don't care because we're all kindergarten you. know um of course words that they use like you. know lake ocean all that good [ __ ] um so i messed with this girl on a dating app the other night i know stupid shouldn't be on that um and she said nice to. meet you pond and i go oh nice pretty big talk. from somebody with a normal name. what's your name with shelby good millions of them. and so she uh then she responded back with wow. are you victim blaming it's not my fault. that my parents name me that. and i said no it's not victim. blaming if i'm saying it in a way. of i i know it's not your fault. but you have a normal. last name so know your normal. last name place. in life you know. so okay i'm not asking on i'm not asking advice. on how to. deal with that i just want funnier. ways to respond. back to people that give me those. kindergarten uh nicknames like you. know just the ones that are just so on. the nose and easy to. grab for it's a good question. but uh yeah thanks guys dude. i think you should say first. of all i think he dealt with it. really well he did but he should say actually. that's funny because i wish we were near. a body of water so i could drown you. right now you know and kill you in a river. or anywhere or if they say hi. pond you say interesting i wish we were near. a pond it's funny you bring that up. because i would love to. drown you yeah for so long. yes yeah and then well now it's on social. media what you what you but yeah. oh right actually what you're saying. no but what you should do. is honestly right all of the things that people say. all the time on cards. okay and always have them with you. good and then you show. them and then when they when they say one. just go like this yep yep. yep pick it out and go. like this it says do you know. how many times someone has called me. pond they would feel that would be good so molded dude. yeah yeah it's that. would be so coldbusted man. yeah it's true. that would be so moted. but also when you start like start. with a number that's already high don't. start at one because then when you pull it out. like don't start from scratch. when you make that list because then when somebody does it. and you're like you know. how many times people have called me. pond and then they read it. and then it says like two no. no no but just no but just say something. that people often say to. me is oh so there's no counter. i'll hand it to. it right okay yeah it. would be so molded yeah. what is moded combusted oh. call busted okay one. time when um um one time. when i was in second grade. uh mrs beatty i i remember. her yeah i had her she was a frumpy. fat one nope oh then i don't know. her don't okay so now that was miss. banaxis okay but no but so now you're being worse. than i was in the beginning. i was just like calling it. back okay but that's fine. but maybe they're dead now who's mrs. beatty mrs beatty beatty this. is [ __ ] mrs beatty was great. he [ __ ] beat me. off you know what i'm saying. no nope absolutely not man. okay okay okay wonderful woman oh okay. second grade teacher and i was yeah. i didn't have her i had miss caldwell i remember her. match venon had her she was pretty oh maybe it's not she probably got hit on she was really old right. mrs caldwell now she was very young. oh damn i i don't know okay. so anyway um rasheed i remember rasheed. he was pretty funny yeah. yeah he was [ __ ] funny i wonder. what he's doing now um he was saying. something to miss beat. him miss beatty was like rasheed. no hold on a second. and hold on a second. and and rasheed said. oh that's called busted and then miss beatty said rasheed. if you don't get out of my face. i'm gonna go bust it. all over you whoa yeah dude. and it was so hilarious. dude i laughed so hard. as you could imagine i mean. even in second grade. he knew it was funny. oh me yeah i had never heard kobasa. before in my life oh so i was laughing. i was having a conniption. thing i mean man. it was so funny uh that's called busted if you don't get it. in my face i'm gonna go bust. it all over the place. so she was i'm gonna go bust. it so that would be a version. of clapping back not the best. idea in 2015 right exactly because she because rasheed. could have went right to. the and she said the teacher. said but she was gonna bust on my face. then she's gone forever witnesses. i was a witness so i would have been like she didn't actually say. that okay well the principle. but she did say that. she didn't know all over the place. called busted all over the place. get caught doing something you shouldn't. while you're convicted guilty of um. cold it yeah they used it. differently though back then kobusted meant. like [ __ ] up not that wait wait. hold it deliver insulted. that's what it was delivered. insult attempt to. highlight inadequacy i'm trying to. raise money for college your mom goes to. god busted that's what it. was yeah right okay yeah hell yeah. dude wow rasheed shout out to. rasheed i wish i remembered rasheed. what the [ __ ] was his last name. i don't know um omar. and thomas omar pigs or omar. holt holt he had a younger sister named tatiana you remember tatiana she was a migrate yeah yeah they looked exactly alike they were both extremely beautiful and they both looked exactly like somehow i gotta hit up one more soon you're still friends with him right yeah i would talk to. him in a bit but anyway you. know we're just having a conversation. now but uh let's go to. the next one guys let's see what's up. hey chris and matt love. the podcast chris you're one. of the funniest guys around. you make me laugh. more than anybody else they're just awesome. been a fan for years. anyway uh i have a problem with uh my group of friends. right now uh i have i have one friend who's not really a part. of my main group of friends. and my main group of friends. does not like this person. at all wow um it's like four different. people they all think they're wild. boisterous to in your face. just doesn't fit the vibe. i guess of what it. usually is when we all hang out the one. guy but i really like this. person uh i've known them. for a long time i think they're fun. i don't get annoyed. by the things they get annoyed. at and i just i'm just wondering what should i do. like if i ever have like a football party. at my house or something. like that i don't want to. not invite this person but i also want all of my main friends. to come anyway yeah what should i do. would they not come see my. whole thing is you don't. have to invite everybody. to everything i hate i don't. like that like when people are like what the [ __ ] you didn't invite me. i totally agree it's okay. to not want to. we've we've we've talked about this. we've talked about this before. i totally agree but here's the thing. this party's at your house. exactly yeah you invite whoever the [ __ ] you want to. come to your [ __ ] house no you know what i'm saying that. is the stupidest [ __ ] thing. okay i kind of secretly like it. but i know you're doing it. i know you do i know. you do look um i think that uh honestly. you gotta be this is my advice. to you dude you're you're legitimately. you can tell right. away you're too nice of a guy. yep you gotta be more of a boss. in this situation if i who you want you. got to be like yo this. is my friend he's good. i want you to. feel me and feel why. he's good because you don't get it. you're out of the loop. and aren't you insecure. about that that's the vibe. he has to have you're completely. yelling yeah okay chuck's coming. okay whether you like it or not. that's even more intense. the [ __ ] it's even more [ __ ] if you can't see it i can't help you but i'm the [ __ ] boss wow now come to. my chargers party or whatever. the [ __ ] yeah come to. come come see the baltimore. ravens chuck's coming and you bring the dip. okay yeah you could do that. and then confrontational and then yeah exactly. but there's a way to. beat it and then you and chuck. scoop that before he even hits. the table when they bring the dip. scoop it eat it feed. chuck here wow eat it. chuck and chuckles and then you both ship. and you both give it to. the guys such a disgusting. party like well that's nobody's gonna go if that's the deal. you know okay chuck chuck. feed him chuck feed him. now whisper right everyone's just like uh we don't nobody wants. to yeah no look on. his face and [ __ ] dip okay so don't do any of that stuff i i don't i disagree it's your party. invite whoever you want if somebody has a problem with it. that is only their problem. if he's if he's your friend and you want to. invite him too ultimately you invite him. too especially if it especially if make the potential. to make that other friend. feel bad is higher. and that affecting you is. higher than the price you. pay for inviting him. and having your other friends. deal with it i i feel like what's the higher. cost you know yeah i feel like it's basically just you have to. um that's a last kind of if if it all comes. down to it yes. but i think that the chips. and the dip thing and then the inviting chuck. and then being more of a boss. is the way to. go okay i just think the chips. thing is a two confrontation. sure i understand but you know what i mean. you got to have that. attitude of like i'll feed you. dip [ __ ] so have the spirit of feed you have. to feed each other making chuck. feed him dead but not literally do that you could i would like that yeah vibe of forcing someone. to feed chips to. the other guy yeah but you don't do. it yeah but you could do it. you could do it but i don't think he should i would. do it but i agree that. this guy probably shouldn't because he'd [ __ ] it all up in the spirit of that is good but i don't think you should literally do that yeah uh invite who you want you could also invite more people and then this way they you know if you're in your water. inviting yeah yeah exactly if you're just inviting. four dudes and then also chuck. a guy they hate yeah. it's like oh i don't want to. go but this sucks man. i've dealt with it before. if people don't like your friend but uh you've dealt with that a lot. because you have some of the worst. [ __ ] friends i invite them all anyway and they show up because i [ __ ] have that feeding the dip mentality and that's why i never hang out with you well it's not why that is one of the reasons why because you always have at least three people who i think hmm yeah you probably have like a body in on in your that's so hilarious dude that's you got a twisted sense of humor but it's so funny

you hate. the monologue in itself. is good in the movie. it kind of explains everything. and in the movie it. makes a movie not as good. but the monologue is good everything. in the movie is less good. because it's in the movie yeah. i mean i basically agree. yes but the movie's good. uh i haven't seen it in way. too long i i just thought. i have a feeling it. is like up to. no goods like some

brotherinlaw's brothers be baby baby mama jesus who started out by following me on instagram and liking my stories and then adding me on facebook and snapchat we've been talking i mean has tourette's we've been talking over snap the last week or so but the thing is that her ex who's the father of her two kids is an absolute lunatic from the stories i've heard should i should i keep talking to her and see where it goes or keep stepping instead of wasting my time like i have every other time i love you all thank you chris for making for loki saving my life and thank you matt for being chris's much more logical but just as funny and much sexier brother so political he didn't say that part okay sexier and cooler and [ __ ] just astonishingly great brother and his instagram here is justin or dealy or ordille um yes it is okay uh there's a picture of him look how cool that's a picture of him he's a great diesel as [ __ ] huh yeah. he's a good guy. i mean where the pictures. taken is hilarious what a great. guy yo let's go do. that lifeline picture under the [ __ ] it's like his head shot or something. his graffiti artist. headshot so uh absolutely don't. stop talking to this girl. just because her ex is up. according to many a lunatic. like well you don't know like just go get it. dude like you can't back. down from a guy. who you literally never even. met just heard stories about come on dude. he has no experience with him. she does not know the guy. and also he's never had sex. dude go and don't stop get it. get it this is all sorts. of [ __ ] up okay there's so many [ __ ] [ __ ] ups here. wow okay go i mean this guy he's never had sex. he's gonna have sex with a [ __ ] whatever that's not a [ __ ] up he's only 21. no no no no that's not a [ __ ] up but i'm saying this for the first time it's all starts to. [ __ ] up dude all right i mean it's too much. going on dude first of all explain. okay he's he okay so he's never had a girlfriend. whatever he's ever whatever uh there's a 25. year old she's older which is okay. uh brotherinlaw's brother's baby. mama read just too. much right brotherinlaws okay okay okay okay so brotherinlaw's brother's baby. mama so already has a baby. with somebody that he knows. right yeah yeah two babies that [ __ ] two kids really yeah my brotherinlaw's baby. mama okay all right so whatever that doesn't matter. one or two it doesn't even. matter but who started out. by following me on instagram. and liking my stories she that's a bit. of a [ __ ] like that's nothing naughty. movie but i don't like how people are like oh my god i agree but the whole thing. is if she's got it going on. and she starts doing this. she needs to know. what the weight she pulls. with in the gotta going. on territory is okay right. can you explain that my point. is if you're bad as [ __ ] and you're a baby. mama's person that knows this. [ __ ] 20 year old dude's virgin. guy and you know you got it. going on right yeah then you're gonna follow. a guy and you know. it's like it's like when a hot. chick is like man i really wish i could help. you know with my taxes and some guy's like i i could probably do. it you know what you're doing. you're giving that guy. false hopes to. squirting no dude that that that that that that that that that's too close. to a bad argument dude. i don't i don't that's not right. it's a great argument it's not what. if she [ __ ] needs some other [ __ ] taxes is yeah i know that you go to. somebody who does that [ __ ] not just some guy. who's [ __ ] hoping to. get squirt to. squirt but come on dad what's wrong. with that why would she not ask. a guy who wants to. help her to help. her just because she thinks he might want. to get to squirt because she'll get it. for free basically there's different levels. of hooking is my point. oh no don't no no. there's not we're not gonna go down. that avenue look it's fine. but i'm saying be it if you're gonna be it you're you're suggesting. that this wouldn't be a hooker. no no no i'm saying it's a skill. she's on the mini end of it. and coupled with all these other red. flags it's a bad guy. liking his photos no coupled. with all the other [ __ ] the baby. mama the the adding uh the uh uh uh ex's. father who has two kids. absolute lunatic oh from the stories of her. doesn't know it it's just a lot. it's just a lot to. take in i think here's my advice. okay just i have sex. with her yeah i'm not saying definitely don't do. it i'm just saying you better. be prepared if it wasn't if he's had sex. before he knows how to. deal with it but dude. he's gonna slide in and he's gonna fall in love dude. okay well beware buyer beware. on that don't fall in love. that's a bad idea that's what. i'm saying it's a sign. maybe you like you roll out you have a couple. [ __ ] halloween nights. you have a good time. and you slide in and then slide. in uhhuh with this woman. okay i just think stop worrying you're 21. and a virgin. like are you kidding. me like you're so young. you've never had sex go. live make a mistake. or two who gives a [ __ ] like yeah go just go do it who cares that's true. all right take take more pictures. under that overpass it looks. [ __ ] alien yeah he looks [ __ ] dope that guy all right cool sounds good next hi matt and chris hi my question is do you have people in your life who are allowed. to fart and people who aren't what a great. question uh my buddies were over. the other day and one of them. farted and i was appalled. and disgusted and said no don't. do that wow and he was rightfully. offended because apparently a few minutes. earlier our other buddy farted and i giggled i had. to dig deep inside myself. and question why can't you and why. can he and why um and i can't find. any explanation other than you're just not that. guy like you just can't and i proceeded. to make a list of people. in my life who can and the list. of people i can't find. any similarities she's funny um what's that. about am i just being a fart. gatekeeper does it make sense. think about the people in your lives. who can and can't have fart. rooms here's what i think no one. can fart around me yeah. don't not no and i can also fart. around everyone that's how everyone feels but it's like it's like you're on spit. like you can look at your own. spit when someone else spits it's like you [ __ ] pig people farting. it is because it leaves. a [ __ ] trace but it's like you know somebody farts and it's like you're a [ __ ] [ __ ] pig like david sullivan farts so much you know i was just with him yeah of course he did because he's got that big [ __ ] head i don't like that and he's [ __ ] gross. and he [ __ ] wears shorts and he farts and [ __ ] can't smell. it so i can't eat cheese. man and then he does. anyway where's savannah yeah you pay. the price we were in savannah. we were in savannah. and he was he was there. in savannah and did his film. festival his film festival coincided with mike. oh cool and he was there. and he was like yeah i'll get this. without cheese though oh wow. and then the guy left and i was like man. you [ __ ] gotta eat cheese. and like nah it makes me. fart man if i eat that special around. people i'll start farting. immediately man why does he act. like he cares he doesn't care. that guy's a [ __ ] disgusting. fart machine so dick he doesn't my point is so dick. he doesn't eat cheese. a lot when i was around. me but i make him do it. and then i tell him not to. fart because i want him that's torturous but okay. so here's where you saw. a movie you've been bypassing. eating cheese so much and not farting. but now you're subjecting people. around you to. the stench of your insides. here's some parmesan eat it. and fart your way out. oh i want to. play a game hahaha [music]. took so long to. get to the joke. you know oh walks around if you're like oh okay so the detectives later i think i know. what happens yeah is chris rock for some reason. i don't know what happened. chris rock okay so i smell. farts so sam jackson background god. damn farts no one is allowed. to fart around me. i just watched spiral okay. no one is allowed. to fart around me. no one is allowed. to burp her on me. no one is allowed. to be [ __ ] disgusting. around me without my express permission. moses [ __ ] signed contract saying it's okay i mean. permissions you know you need signed. permission to fart a [ __ ] just keep it walk out. of the [ __ ] room walk out of the [ __ ] room you're gonna fart i won't you won't but that's great. you don't it's gross. your farts smell like [ __ ] death. that's not true your farts smell. like decomposed corpses after 30. seconds after i put altoids up my butt. okay well they [ __ ] don't work okay. none of this is true. guys i do know what she means. though about how some people are less. gross when they fart and some people are more. even if they're the same. fart but for me it's a no. fart rule just don't do it. your house is in no fart. zone unless it's you and i'm alone. yeah right right are you dude. if i'm in a room. with somebody i don't [ __ ] fart no the other way. around you no because you've got to. be honest when i am. in a room and i fart. i'm being me i'm giving you all. of me i'm not holding back. no one wants respectful. that's not respectful no one. wants all of you they. go i go you're welcome. that's yeah come on you want. me to not be me. you're a psychopath you're straight up psychopath. who was the person that called. in we're just kind of started. to talk about oh yeah i think that there's a no. farts on it that's really. i really like that you have a list. of people who can and can't fart. yeah and i think that you should brief. people on who can and can't. yeah yeah totally but like and then when they say. why not me you say. honestly because i think you're more disgusting. than the other guy yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah you're the kind of guy. i don't want to. smell their insides yeah you're gross. you gross me out already yeah. and then when you fart. it puts you over the [ __ ] edge because you're disgusting. you [ __ ] pig so dick so i think but also some parts sound wet some people do well come on i don't do i want my shit's dry but i don't do wet ones but sometimes you hear like their cheeks. you know and it's disgusting. as [ __ ] yeah it's so gross. and then dude have you ever. farted but and then [ __ ] by mistake not me. i never honestly i actually never have. done that i've heard people talk about me. too eric griffin talked about it. last night oh well then now that. is gross yep he farted. dude and he didn't know any any [ __ ] when he took a steppy [ __ ] [laughter] and then like get up and be like oh i bet when he tells the story he describes the farts 100 yeah yeah yeah because that's his signature move all right first time i met him i was astonished at how many times he did this i know yeah i know it's disgusting. oneonone yeah i was farting. [ __ ] coming everything was that dude with privates. everything everything is squirting okay cool next yo chris saying what up. from scotland right now um i'm attending. university here and life rips. uh until recently when a situation involving my best. friend and our conflicting love life. and a little bit of backstabbing. has been making me blood. red mad oh no um anger. isn't something i really feel ever um so it feels kind of foreign. but it feels kind of good. in that it's like pushing. me to want to. do better in all aspects of my life. um so because it's kind of out. of spite i could see. how that could be unhealthy. but maybe it's uh maybe it's for the better. um so yeah i'm just wondering if you guys. think anger can be a good. thing if it's experienced. occasionally and handled in a way that is productive or if you should avoid it entirely and how do you guys deal with anger uh yeah appreciate the advice guys peace you can't avoid it entirely so you have to. embrace it yeah it's like it's not something. you don't agree they're gonna. die when you're 48. yes exactly because somebody's going to. cut them off of the car he's gonna be like this. huh like literally you felt. no the detectors are gonna be like no nothing. happened you just felt no. anger and then all of a sudden some cut him off and it was too. much and it's easier what the heck. what's going on you. can't hold in all anger. because the truth is if you're not if you never express. anger you're a [ __ ] liar and you're scary. because everyone feels anger from time. to time it's just another version of sadness. uh and it's sadness. that bothers us so much we don't we can't. control it we can't deal. with it so we start. [ __ ] getting furious right. that's why my men get more. mad than women because they don't like to. deal with sadness and what are you doing. [music] [laughter] [music] so close [music]. the war shot going from. the [ __ ] eye to. the mouth you know so bad. dude um you have to. be mad are you really not mad. or are you just convincing. yourself your mouth he said he's blood red mad. he said he is okay. so then what's he saying he's talking about letting that out. and of course you have to. let that out yeah go. try boxing or something talking to. your [ __ ] friend about it man. oh yeah like and let it let yourself. be angry don't be mean. there's see here's the thing. yeah there's a difference between being angry. and mean yeah so you're allowed. to express anger but you're not allowed. to be mean it's like it's like the difference between you can't. feel bad for things that you feel. but you can feel bad for things. that you do yeah based on those. feelings you can be you can be like god. damn it i'm so pissed. off at you but you can't. be like i'm so pissed off. at you and you're short. yeah yeah that would be yeah that would be uh and you're frumpy. and fat okay i i think uh yeah. what's weird about this guy. is he's very articulate. and speaking about it like he kind of knows what's happening. which is the opposite of people. who don't want to. deal with their emotions so i'm going. to go ahead and say he's a sociopath. we've diagnosed him i mean no i think he just bottles. it up too much. and yeah no he would be a sociopath. if he like didn't feel those things yeah. okay i guess so you're right. right yeah so what you want to. do is let it out like even if it's into. a pillow just hold. it over your face and go ah wow. good gonna let it out i'm gonna let it. in from counterintuitive they hit. counterintuitive um all right so i yeah. i think that that's probably you gotta you. gotta talk to your friend. yeah dude yeah it's bad news. get to it you're gonna. get cancer and you're gonna die. at 40. yeah you will get cancer. dude someone's not going to. say excuse me you're going. to be like you can't bottle it up. that much yeah do a wet. fart and die hey chris hey matt this is beautiful in texas so i have some put your opinion on or need some advice on um it's a subject that is a little slightly embarrassing just because it is being broadcast. of the world but you know so for as long. as i can remember right. when i hit the hit um it's it's you know. yeah before i clean myself. with soap that's cool um i want to. be all over myself i just pee watch everybody. get up with my husband gross. disgusting oh come on um he doesn't understand. well why don't you just the warm. water makes you want to. pee there well i mean. that's fine but i it's like saving. a couple minutes okay. so that's one i just wanted to. see the president you guys be. in the shower does kristen. be in the shower is. it a normal thing or am. i really that disgusting. so i just wanted to. know if kristin but set the whole thing. up just so no i don't know. so here's the thing your husband's a [ __ ] weirdo people that are like oh you pee in the shower. and then i get in there. like show us the most sanitary. [ __ ] place in the world because soap is constantly running. across the floor of the [ __ ] shower. people are cleaning themselves in the shower. yes they're getting the dirt. off their bodies but guess where the dirt. goes down the [ __ ] drain. nothing dude that's not gross. at all people it. was so stupid man. it is not it is. not gross i i don't know it. i don't know this guy. just has a weird thing about it. i guess but also like how many showers. are you're taking with your significant. other i i can't even think of like maybe i've done. it five times you know. like i that's how much is he getting. mad at this just pee or don't. take showers with him i don't. think it's even because he's with her. oh he's just [ __ ] oh what the [ __ ] that's what i'm saying. that's ridiculous then that's ridiculous that's exactly. what i'm saying yeah right. right exactly okay that's everything. you know yeah you don't want to. lie but also like what the [ __ ] it's like if someone's being that petty and stupid and it's that small of a thing you can lie about it but also if you want to. be like sometimes you don't need to. pee before you go. in the show and you get in the shower. and you're like oh that warm. water makes me want to. pee warm water makes you want. to pee you think that's what's going. on with her well yeah man. when you you know the whole thing. is like put your hand in a when you're sleeping. all right right right i don't know i tried to. do it to. you once you didn't piss. you did that to. me yeah it didn't work. why'd you do that. to me we were young. how young you were 35. no. you were uh you know. we were in new jersey. oh no we were knocking out. that's a horseshit thing. to do man. while i tried to. do it man well [ __ ] you dude well one time i also put a [ __ ] a watch in your pillowcase and it ticked so much and you were so and you were so mad and you were like dad what is this ticking noise and he's like i don't hear it matt and i heard it from the other room and i was laughing so hard you are a [ __ ] piece of [ __ ] and you were like i hear it he's like no it wasn't why is that funny you [ __ ] [ __ ] it's uh it was funny to. me at the point it's not funny.

[ __ ] oh dude every every every color. in this shot is a different shade. of the same color. yeah on him on his skin. the back the brick the [ __ ] uh couch his balls. balls and country magazines wow dude. jesus this is this is the cover. of balls and countrymax yeah. all right cool next i mean. not next episode 29 of lifeline. right now or just started it. uh and you know i thought i'd ask for a little bit of advice. myself so great nice um i'm the seventh grade. basketball coach for a boys. basketball team i'm good and i started doing it. last year ton of fun. i love coaching um super fun. age to coach to. be around but you know i can only take 12. kids on the team. and this year there's going to. be i think like 19. or so trying out seven um so it's my least. favorite part of the year. every year every every season. it's it's besides wearing pants. terrible not fun i hate that. um you know i think i dislike it. as much as the kids. who get cut dislike it uh it's not enjoyable. in the slightest and i was wondering if i could get some advices. about uh how to. how to break the news. to the kids that are not gonna. make the team um i think that'd be pretty. helpful uh so i'd like to. hear what you got thanks. that's got to be rough wow. them down one by one. what else to show his body. he takes the phone back. to his bedroom and then cuts. it and here's what you do. you don't start with how much of a great. person you are you start. with the fact that unfortunately he didn't make the team. but he didn't make the team. yeah but then you talk to. him about him about the kid. across from you you tell him. how great he is what. you do like about him. don't but don't here's the key. kids especially kids that age are hypersensitive to. when they're being fed [ __ ] uh just make sure you pay a lot of attention. to these kids when they're uh trying out. for the team especially the ones that you know. you're gonna cut and start filing away. the things you could tell them. about themselves that aren't [ __ ] [ __ ] that's the best you can do it sucks either way that that would be terrible that would be i would [ __ ] hate that dude but they can smell [ __ ] kids do it especially seventh eighth grade that age. they're ready for it their parents. lie to. them all the time about how [ __ ] great they probably are yeah they used to. parents say stuff like that. uh what what they say. i'm not high and they've been doing. rails of cocaine okay yeah there's that. too probably um so deeper. you know well i mean our parents. terrible childhood uh but no but uh that's so that's what. my but it will be like look you didn't make the team. but you have nice hair. next bring phil in here. phil uh no not that you know. but but the thing i said yeah. that is what you're saying. you're dedicated a few like actual minutes to. it though don't like don't let him. like leave uh uh i'm just thinking about it. like kids probably cry. that sucks but definitely do it. oneonone uh in a behind a closed. door whatever the [ __ ] yeah where other kids. can't hear well but you need to. have another adult in the room. oh yeah i guess so right. yeah that's [ __ ] stupid but go ahead. yeah what about you no. i mean that's all i mean. i agree like it's [ __ ] it's tough that sucks. my heart goes out to. you i have to. do that [ __ ] and ruin a kid's life because that's what you're doing you know what else he's doing though he's exposing his balls. to these kids and that's not good. either i like guys who could rock shorts. like that my legs are. [ __ ] horrible how about how good i am calling when someone's athletic when someone's [ __ ] this and that when it says i said six british. players wild yeah i'm great yeah uh this one wasn't that. good though you said tennis it. was good you didn't say. coach it's like a number of things. you didn't get okay well all you did. was like say a sport. and then he said a sport. you know honestly my necks hurt. so bad when i did that. that i thought i was not gonna be able. to move past. that not be able to. continue the podcast well we're almost done. here one more we'll do one. more yeah and then moan about your neck. oh what's going on chris and matt. uh love the podcast. i will be seeing you chris. at the beacon theater. in new york [ __ ] city. dot com and that leads me to. my question i am going. alone did i ask my friends. to come yes did they want. to come with me did i get vip. meet and greets to. see you after the show yes did i want to. buy my girlfriend another vip. meet and greet to. come with me absolutely not. so i'm going alone. i've never done that before how do you navigate. those waters at a comedy. show or a concert. do you sit down in your chair. you look to your left. look to your right. hey i'm here by myself want to. be friends how do you navigate. it would appreciate any help. and i will see you february something. don't know the exact date. peace dude that's hilarious. i actually think it's cool. to go to anything. alone dude i love going. to [ __ ] alone you know i mean comedy. is one of those things. you want to. experience with somebody if they really want to. go to yeah and you're like yeah. you know but if that you're if you're not gonna bring somebody. like that go alone. go alone people always comment on like my instagram. i see like oh you should i go. alone i'll be driving from dude. it's like such an awesome. experience by yourself because you don't get interrupted you're just watching and you get to. take it in and you're also with a bunch of people that are likeminded. because they all like the same. person i love it. you're definitely not the only [ __ ] there alone first of all yeah second of all you're right it is a little bit different in comedy. you want that person there. where you want to. like [ __ ] you know like elbow and be like yeah how funny is that but also like movies and [ __ ] i oh i mean i i wouldn't say i prefer to. go alone but it's just the same. like you want to. sit and watch a show you're not gonna be talking during the show. yeah the only thing is on the way. there and on the way. back but [ __ ] that yeah if you go alone to. yeah you go to. alone but if i liked music. i would go to. music shows alone because other but that's probably why i don't like music. but like to. go experience it by myself. and i have somebody being like talking while i'm doing while. i'm watching movies i would go alone. um or you know. a magic show this way. you can just really be like wow. wow
