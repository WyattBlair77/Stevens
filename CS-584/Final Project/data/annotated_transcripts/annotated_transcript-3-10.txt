you. guys i'm very grateful thanksgiving. is upon us you know. we've done a lot of thanksgiving. episodes here at congratulations. maybe three or four we've done. a lot of different episodes. here congratulations you know this is like a 200 900. episode and uh i really started. thinking what is thanksgiving because. i don't really know what the [ __ ] it is i know people came to. america and like slaughtered some indians. and and pretended it was like not that. and they wear belts. on their hats and uh you know. which is weird right to. have a [ __ ] buckle straight on your forehead. you dumb dumb idiots. but uh some of those guys were our ancestors i guess. and canada and america celebrates thanksgiving. now they do it differently. right canadian thanksgiving is in. october i think and uh thanksgiving. thanksgiving is in november. so i thought i'd google. thanksgiving because you don't ever really. do the simple [ __ ] but you have to. if you're a dad right like calvin asked me. stuff that i don't even think about that. i know the answer to. but i haven't thought about it in [ __ ] 40 years now i learned about what thanksgiving. is but if somebody were to. say what is thanksgiving i would. just be like it's in november. and we eat turkey and stuffing. and argue with your family. so i googled it what is thanksgiving. and why do we celebrate it now. i just googled thanksgiving and that. was the first question that comes. up which means it's a bunch of dumdums. it's a bunch of dumdums. in the world not just me. it's a bunch of dumdums. not just well not in the world. even though they are in the world. because america is the micro to. the macro of the world but in america. it's a bunch of dumdums. because that's the first thing that was googled when you google. thanksgiving now they could be ukrainian they could be. they could be from africa they could be. from china they could be for penguins. from antarctica googling this i guess that could be why it pops up. but mostly it's probably americans. thinking wait what is it. again so it's a bunch. of dum dums thanksgiving day. annual national holiday in the united states. and canada is celebrating the harvest. and other blessings of the past. year pretty general pretty vague and seems like a [ __ ] [ __ ] reason to. slaughter a bunch of indians. but americans generally believe that. their thanksgiving was modeled on. a 1621 harvest feast shared by. the english colonists pilgrims. of plymouth and the wampanoag people. those are the indians. right now that seems like a very nice glossed. over version of what thanksgiving. is thanksgiving is a national. all right um oh look at this. canada uh wait hold on thanksgiving. is a national holiday support. on various dates in the united states. canada granada st lucia and liberia um weird one to. throw in there at the end. and it began his day. of giving thanks for the blessings. of harvest and of the proceeding year. okay cool yeah thanksgiving cool. similar name festival holidays. occur in germany and japan. wow imagine thanksgiving in japan. just showing up and just [ __ ] mukbanging it is that racist. um let's go to. uh the wikipedia what is the true. here we go what is. the true meaning of look. at this 1637 is the true. origin of thanksgiving since the massachusetts. bay colonies governor john. winthrop declared a day. to celebrate colonial soldiers who had just slaughtered hundreds of. pico men women and children. that is now mystic connecticut k. got so sad um look at this. the real history the true. story behind the activity is a bloody. one and some people say it's time. to cancel the holiday well of course they do. right i have a buddy. mitchell jones and he eats pizza. on thanksgiving because he's like [ __ ] that [ __ ] they slaughtered so many people it has turned into. a time of family. and food it really goes to. show you though what time. heals all right like now it's just we were like yes thanksgiving when it was in actuality was like so you never know uh what people will morph. the holocaust into. in uh you know. 300 years it could just be like you know. yeah [ __ ] you know it. could be jews giving coming up. soon and you don't even. know about it and then the people are like you know they killed a bunch of jews. and it was a hitler. was like this guy and people are like yeah don't ruin my [ __ ] [ __ ] i want to. eat stuffing um thanksgiving. is in the u.s is traditionally a time. for family and food american. sculptures and typically learn. that [ __ ] uh story goes friendly this. is the story friendly american. indian local swooped in to. teach the struggling colonists how to. survive and what the europeans called. the new world then everyone got together. to celebrate a feast. in 1621 that's what i learned. and as a kid i remember the pictures. of the guy with the [ __ ] belt on his hat and another dude in the headdress sharing a turkey leg. i remember that one of them. was holding a musket the other one was holding a bow and arrow. at ease a spear at ease. and the indian kid. was playing with the colonialist i remember it. i remember that mural. i remember people painted mirrors i remember painting. a mural on a king's grocery. store window as a freshman. i was good at art. there were other but no not a freshman. because i was already in los. angeles i was in let's see. [ __ ] a young grade and the other fifth graders. were killing it and they asked. me to do it. because i was a good artist. whatever uh i painted kings my mom. was real happy dude. i painted king's uh the window. of kings and my mom was really happy. that i did it when we drove. by and it felt really good. that i did it and uh so go. eat that [ __ ] all right [ __ ] man i felt good and it was cute. all right i was about eight. years old or 10. years old and i painted the [ __ ] out of the side windows. at the king's grocery store. in new jersey all right. near the movie theater so go [ __ ] yourself all right. yeah sometimes i did things. that made me feel good. and i've got a heart. i'm like the grinch. but also my heart grows at the end. of that movie uh and then one time. i took a break from eating. eating took a break from painting. and i was with a dude. that was older and we were eating. at the cozy end and we were eating. and then i i undid the salt. and uh i put the uh um what do you call. it the tissue in the salt. and put it over the holes. so you couldn't tell that it. was clogged and i screwed it. back on and i left it. there and then the older kid. was like you like messing with people huh. and i was like i don't know yeah. he was like so i went and never forgot. it um and i think about it. all the time because again. had to uh taylor ham. and eggs uh one time. my mom yelled at me. instead of my brother. uh because we got in trouble. my brother did something she goes. christopher and i said i didn't do. it she's like oh matthew. i mean and i was like now. you got to yell at him. she's like no it's over. and i got i felt slighted dude. that's life anyway i don't mean to. you know digress let's get back. into this thanksgiving. thing dude i remember that. mural is what i'm saying. i remember that mural. wow thanksgiving 2021 was the 400th. anniversary of that first american. thanksgiving but in reality this. is in the insider they lie. a lot but this is but in the reality. thanksgiving feasts predate plymouth and the peace. celebrated that day was tenuous the real. story do you think i could do that. i could actually do books. like that the real story behind the holiday. is so dark in fact that some people are rethinking. how they celebrate the holiday or whether they should at. all i'm turning into. the dude from [ __ ] uh dateline. so that wasn't the first they're saying it. was in 1619 according to. national geographic and national. geographic doesn't lie you. know how they don't lie. because they show pictures of people with the long. necks and the [ __ ] the the gold things that stretch the [ __ ] out and the and the saucers in the [ __ ] the african tribes. and the sauces and the bottom lips. and they [ __ ] they [ __ ] each other and and they're they're mating dance is this you ever see that that african tribe. with their mating dances like. this i'm not even lying. that's what it is they just chuck. his teeth having really nice teeth. it's really sexy i guess. that they just go it's like the most insecure. mating dance but dude. they the dude see that and they get [ __ ] you know bracket. geck and then slide in that wetness because the chicks are like that's what they do. it's not even i'm not lying. look it up that's some african tribe. [ __ ] and i'm you know honestly i'm all for it dude. i can't think of anything. that would turn me on. more than a woman just going. for no reason if she had nice teeth. do not being dead serious. all good got problems with dead. serious no i don't have problems how about that. i do have problems but that's not one. of them because that would mean. that i was racist. i'm not racist that's what african. tribes do if you have a problem. with what me and african tribes. do then you're racist. dude if you're upon what i do. with that because that's what african tribes. do so you're racist. if you're mad at me for that. um but anyway uh 1619 they're saying now is the real. first thanksgiving uh and the meal was probably a little more than some oysters. and ham thrown together so disgusting. could you imagine a worse. meal than ham and then also oysters. son healthy but it wasn't processed. back then so decades before that. spanish settlers and members of the siloi tribe broke bread in florida with salted pork yum dude garbanzo beans and a mass oops uh in 1565. i mean how far back does. this goddamn go start with the beginning. dude i don't like when [ __ ] things are like hey this is what it wasn't and neither was this. and neither was this. this is what it was started. where it starts how far back. we going dude our modern. definition of thanksgiving revolves around. eating turkey nice dark meat. is popping white meat. is even more popping if it's not. dry if it's dry dark. meat is more popping but this is more. of an occasion for religious. religious observance in past. centuries okay fine the here we go the pilgrims. would most likely consider their sober. 16 23 day of prayer. and first uh for the first actual thanksgiving. for the first year massachusetts blog you know what dude. here we go the enduring. holiday was erased from our. collective memory what happened. between wham panag and the english. generation later okay so wow. uh so masa site. this is important guys we got this. is american history baby the wampanog. paramount chief allied with the english. settlers of plymouth was established. and fought with the newcomers against the french. and other local tribes. but the alien alliance became strained over. time as a thousands more english. colonists moved to plymouth taking over. more land yes see authorities are sort of controlled. over most aspects of wimpug wempanog. life yeah a study published. okay oh wait there was it. a study published in a journal. quaternary science reviews estimated that. disease has already reduced the new. england indigenous population by 90. jesus christ that's the first. covet uh they needed to. get vaccinated they got it. they called it indian fever. which definitely would be racist. now at this point i mean. you couldn't even [ __ ] mention uh china when it had to. do with covet otherwise you were. um this is crazy so they just killed the the wampanog. warriors responded with raids and the new england. confederation of colonies declared war. in 1675 so they were there. for a bit the war. was bloody and devastating each so really there. was a thanksgiving and then what happened. was there it got a little the people who lived there. got a little bit pissed. off and i understand. that dude they're like they were like the the the colonists. were like the you know. the motherinlaw or the [ __ ] you know the cousins that won't they're like yo dude why don't you stay at my place. yeah stay at it. for a little bit and then they do. and then they're eating your [ __ ] and you're like you didn't really put the uh the stuff. back it's fine but just next time. put it back and they're like oh sh. my bad dude i fell asleep. right after and you're like okay. cool and then later on that. happens again and you're like excuse. me colonists that live here in my place. uh it's getting out of control. i'm getting pissed off and then it led to. fisticuffs really but it led to. very violent fisticus because if you're in an open. area and this [ __ ] is going on and we're not talking about your house but we're talking about land. then you get really really really involved. you're like this is my birthright. right i didn't just build this. house but i me and my family. we have been here since the dawn of time. and you're just going to. come in here with. all your buckles and [ __ ] and you're gonna [ __ ] try to. take it from us yeah. you got guns but dude. we go crazy yeah you got crazy. but dude have you ever. heard a scalp taken oh i know you got [ __ ] that'll put us on our backs real quick but how about this i got [ __ ] that'll put you on yours. slowly see that's what i would have been like if i was an indian somebody encroached. in my territory it's all good. yeah yeah yeah yeah break. some [ __ ] wings off eat it. go ahead have some wine. look at that hey chill out. by the campfire i got a tent. that's barely used over there and check out. that wigwam but hold up though. it's been a month so now what you're pulling. your weight so now what you're holding. out there and i don't mean [ __ ] hot i mean harwin that meant a whole different [ __ ] back then what's going on hey did you [ __ ] my wife no i asked my wife about it and she said you [ __ ] her in the wigwam so now i'm getting pissed off because you're encroaching and also i've been here [ __ ] so now what do we do oh you got guns. though oh [ __ ] you could end my life real quick me as the indian. goes like this [laughter]. i'll put you on your back. real slow we've got dull tomahawks we've got bows and arrows you know. how many have to. hit you before you get we're not that good. of a shot oh we got [ __ ] clumsy guys in our squad. oh [ __ ] hey pilgrim we got clumsy guys in our tribe we'll shoot you up near the shoulder oops we'll shoot you in the back of the calf. whoops ah did that graze your rib. cage whoops try 40 of. those and then i'll scalpia and then i'll collect them

here so in a way you kind of have to. give thanks even though it sucks. for the people that aren't here right. i guess there's a lot. less indians because of it. but and now and then americans. are like we'll just give them. casinos i guess every now and then if it's on their land. [ __ ] it just give them have a look yeah that's the best. part yeah give the indians. casinos where more white people. show up more disrespectful. white people show up just coughing all over. their [ __ ] land just sitting down fat as [ __ ] pulling. this yeah i've never been to. a casino too where i didn't see. a few people with only one. arm like for some reason. that is one arm city. dude when you go to. a um casino all you got to. do is look around. a little bit and you'll see people. with less limbs than normal. i don't know what it is. about you know they really want to. press their luck but they can only press. it with one arm it's just crazy. because that is very interesting. and that go go now. if you're at a casino right. now listening because your congratulations. look around do you see. that guy there that's the guy. i'm talking about how about that. you got [ __ ] couples old ass couples just pulling. the [ __ ] levers just pulling. that lever just waiting for 30. g's to roll out or whatever 5gs i don't know man it's weird what the world has come to. right but you know. what can i say i'm a nihilist. i'm an alice but i'm also hoping for the best. like i said i'm the grinch. with the small heart. but also it's growing it's at the end. of the movie i feel like i'm not at the end. of my movie i'm in the middle. you know that's a great. up so every now and then i have an emotional time. in my life like if i break down. and cry which i do sometimes. full disclosure don't like breaking. down and crying but it's also necessary. sometimes i do that i wipe my tears. and i go like this. that was a tremendous first act because it ain't. over [ __ ] it ain't over it. j i'm just getting started. right whenever anyone happens. my heart gets broke. i fall down to. pick myself up and i [ __ ] wipe those tears. away i go like this. well that was a phenomenal first. act what about you got it. might be hard dude. are you wiping away. your tears yup well. that was a [ __ ] phenomenal first. act and then it's me just out. outdoors just drinking coffee. meeting people having a good time. buying a suit you know because life gets hard. man especially during the holidays. you ever deal with that. seasonal depression [ __ ] dude that seasonal depression aka depression dude out to. lunch get out i wonder what oj's life. is like right now for real. i'm honest like being dead. honest like right now what does he do. for thanksgiving who's around him. because people love people people love everyone has people that love them. right and here's the thing. he was acquitted but also he was assumed. that he did do it. and he just got off off a technicality. or some [ __ ] because johnny. cochran was like you know you can't arrest this. black dude i think that was actually. what he said you can't. arrest this black dude see bro. and uh one fire literally is leaving. leaving the studio right now in the middle of it. so disrespectful one fire. but he says yeah he said he had a meeting what could be more. important than this [ __ ] awardwinning. network tv show um but yeah so oj uh yeah uh i don't know some people think it was his son if you ever look at that look i have no conspiracy. theorist but i will say this. dude if calvin committed a crime. like that no he didn't. it was me it was me. that did it same dna. because that's my dna. oh no no no no it wasn't him. it was me dude. i tell you right. now it was me you know. how that song i want. a man on a counter. it wasn't me i make this. song [ __ ] you're starting to. stabbed her in the fur in the [ __ ] solar plexus. it was me that's how it goes yes. i'm joked her in the living room. he gave us so much. racing laughs just uncut her in the test. it was me that was me. uh uh there he was just stabbing air. all in the back and in the front. there he was just choking her. neck and you can see the ligament. ligatures um yeah dude but what's his life like man. he's on twitter popping. off right i don't know if he does. instagram it's crazy what do these guys do how do you live that way. i guess you got to. keep living right i guess. you just got to. keep going you got to. keep putting one foot in front of the other it's [ __ ] actually insane. it's actually insane right because i think oj probably thinks he didn't. do it remember that [ __ ] when he drove and people are like remember when he remember when he drove away and in the bronco and people are like oh he didn't if he did if he wasn't guilty he wouldn't drive away. [ __ ] all that dude [ __ ] all that i do not agree with that i don't agree with that at all our cowlings drove him right he didn't do it so what about that. what was he guilty of he was guilty. of driving he was guilty of taking his friend. and just [ __ ] driving into. the sunset man oj had. the gun i would have pulled that. trigger i'll tell you man. he's a stronger dude. than i am i would have pulled. that trigger maybe that's a running. back in him dude no i could go another. yard not me dude. i go no more yards. bang ling looks back. oh [ __ ] i don't mean to. get so serious but jesus. christ [ __ ] all that man uh that was crazy i remember watching that on the little tv um in uh yeah in in the millets uh kitchen and they finally pulled him over oj and uh i wonder what his life's like you have to. find some real acceptance man. because i saw somebody once that was uh uh that. uh there's a clip of o.j walking. on the street and someone was like hi. oj it's really nice to. meet you let me just shake. your hand and he [ __ ] and he's oh hello. and he shook her hand. and she said yeah i've never actually. shook a hand with a murderer. before thanks and he goes oh okay. oh okay you know crazy. what if he didn't do. it wow i feel like in hundreds of years. in hundreds of years we're going. to be able to. get dna from people's bodies. no matter how old they are. like decompose whatever bones. and [ __ ] you take a little bit you stick it in a program. and i think in hundreds of years. maybe a thousand years you. will be able to. see all of their thoughts. that's what i think and you will. be able to. see uh digitally what they've done. and i think we're going to. realize that so many people did some [ __ ] [ __ ] that i mean dude the human race. is just you know. deplorable but i'll tell you what dude. sore lizards sore lizards so at least we. have houses that's all i'm saying. um yeah man whatever. shout out to oj and [ __ ] uh on thanksgiving. uh yeah i don't know. it's pretty crazy hope everyone's with their family. i want a [ __ ] nick cannon family is what i want just a big [ __ ] nick cannon family kid guy's got 11 kids more another 12th one i thought this was the 11th one he's got 12 kids. dude jesus what's the oldest one. and what's the youngest one. this guy was just popping. him out different wives. right this next one. is like the third or fourth child. with her um so he's got a few baby. moms um that's the kind of [ __ ] i want to. hold army man those thanksgiving. must be popping but the problem. is having more than like [ __ ] three kids is that one of them. is going to end. up hating you that's the thing. you could have two kids. and work it out you have three kids. work it out you guys. are getting four or five the dynamic. changes right i loved having one. brother because everything that i loved i could share. with one other person that i loved and it was beautiful. the connection is amazing. if you watch my podcast lifeline. with my brother you can tell we love each other. you know we got each other's back. no matter what and that's a beautiful. thing kristen has her brother it's just oneonone and that's a beautiful. thing and that's not taking anything. from somebody with three kids or you got two. or three siblings or. whatever i think that's great. too but then you got the outlier. sibling right like you got the two. kids and then the one other one or the three. kids and then the one other one right. and the one other one is always the one. that's like yeah i don't know. if i can make it thank this. thanksgiving i gotta do a lot. of work and also secretliness had i don't really like coming. in anything you know i'm in massachusetts. now or whatever i don't know. if i could just be doing that. [ __ ] um come in and drop in my family. i got a family. and it's like you know so there's something to. be said for a oneonone [ __ ] and i know if you're a oneonone if you're two siblings i know you feel it. now if you're twins all bets. are off you're [ __ ] that's it if you have twins that's it. because if you have twins and then another kid. later that other kid's [ __ ] he doesn't have telepathy like you two do you punch one. twin the other twin feels it the other is like i don't you know i don't what do i do you guys look the same and you are the same in me i'm just kevin that's sad as [ __ ] if i was the brother of two twins do you know what i would be the most successful warlord straight up i'd have deeper issues and problems they would have telepathy together so i would work on being a [ __ ] warlord and i'll tell you what i wouldn't be a good one not that there are many good warlords but i would be the most disrespectful bloodiest warlord of all time and it's all my parents fault. for having me because they had twins too. and they should have stopped right. there so now guess what mom and dad. you get a warlord [music]. you get a warlord you get a warlord. you get a warlord reach under your seat. that's a warlord for you. you get a warlord is. a great title um it's also the thanksgiving. episode so it's kind of odd. but whatever you get a warlord. the thanksgiving episode is what it's called. uh yeah man the bloodiest warlord. that's what i'd be because i tell you man. it's i having matt growing. up was absolutely amazing. i told him this on lifeline. but i uh i put a [ __ ] ticking uh a loud there was a watch that. i had in my bedroom and i put it under his in his pillow. and it was ticking. any and and and i forgot i did. it earlier on in the day. and i was like this. could be annoying for him. when he goes to. sleep and then my dad. and then my i hear him. from the other room. my my brother dad what the f. can you come here you go. there and then i hear my dad. in the other room just like i don't [ __ ] hear it. i don't talk about that. i don't care i don't. know what i'm saying and i was like oh are they doing the [ __ ] thing with the watch and they don't know about it so i walk in and i was like what's going on and my brother said my pillow's ticking. and i was like what and he's like no. and my dad's like no. it's not you know my dad's [ __ ] now at this. point is a little hard of hearing. but back then he probably was just that's when we figured it out. is when i threw a [ __ ] swatch in my brother's pillowcase. i remember i was like it's ticking. and my dad's like no. it's not i don't hear. it and then i go oh man. i did this i'm sorry. i thought it would be funny. and it was for a little bit. and i took the watch out. and that's like and then my dad. said why'd you put a watch in this. [ __ ] pillowcase and i literally was like for this reason it's hilarious. to have hilarity in sue. what do you mean. why we're all here this. is the answer um so yeah i did. that family shit's awesome dude. how hilarious [ __ ] is awesome. if it's awesome if it's not. it's [ __ ] harrowing um but yeah to. have 12 kids nick cannon. to have 12 kids. it's funny to. that his last name is canon and he's and he's basically just shooting kids. out of his dick. uh um cannon i don't know man. it's wild to. have 12 kids what's up. with that huh it's just wild. it's also a bit wild. to have one like i was talking to. a guy yesterday who had one. kid and he's like you know. a freshman in high school. right now and i was thinking about how it would be to. give like if i only had calvin to. give all my love to. him i would be a wreck. every day like i would be the most overbearing. if you have other kids you could spread out. the overbearingness you understand. but i would be so worried like say calvin. wants to play football. i go great that's it. okay you're gonna get [ __ ] concussed you're the only one i got because a little bit i'm like the tutors dude. a little bit i believe in like my bloodline. needs to live forever. a little bit i know. it's 2022 it doesn't really. matter and what's in a bloodline. what's in a name it doesn't really matter. we're all people and the world's gonna explode. soon the world's gonna it's not. even gonna explode people worry about the world. exploding shit's so [ __ ] up the world's gonna implode like before we even die. we're gonna see the [ __ ] the waves and the and the and the and the mountains. just suck us in and and dude. with my luck the world's gonna [ __ ] you know implode and i'm gonna see like it's gonna be like as it comes through and as the world concaves i'm gonna start seeing like you know the san fernando valley and then and then like glendale california and it's gonna be imploding inward and like you know obviously whatever the opposite of where i am right now is like israel or some [ __ ] is going to. be way in the distance. i won't be able to. see that but on the sides. i'll see [ __ ] concaving in and like right before i die. i'll [ __ ] uh i'll get i'll get like smashed with whitney cummings house. or some [ __ ] and my last thought will be like ah yeah a [ __ ] course you know and uh so that's what's gonna happen is like the world's just gonna implode right but uh yeah if you've got one kid i don't know how you [ __ ] give all of your love to. one person it's got to. be also special in a way. right it's got to. be also beautiful in a way. because right now it feels beautiful. but calvin's two and a half you know. the more kids that we have uh the more i i maybe i'm looking at it. wrong actually maybe i'm looking at it. wrong you know what i bet. i am looking at it. wrong i bet because right. now i'm thinking we've got all the love. to i [ __ ] dude i figured it out man. i figured it out. without even having more kids. here's the deal i i thought i should have known. this man i thought everyone has the amount of love. that they could possibly access. ingrained into them. at birth but that's not what it. is dude your heart. grows it expands and. i know this because when i had calvin. i didn't know i could love something so much. so having more kids after that. it doesn't mean my love for calvin's. going to dilute it. means i'm gonna have that much love. for the others as well. and thus more love in my heart. oh we [ __ ] figured it out he's a real person. and it took him he took the long way. but he absolutely became a real person. he takes the long way. sometimes because walking the path. isn't linear he sees. the top of the mountain. he tried to climb. it but really what he should have. done is twist he's all the way. to the top he took. the long way folks. and sometimes with the twisty. ways he realized wait. i've been here before because he wasn't rising at all. but that's okay because it was all part. of the journey and it took the long way. folks [music] we love it dude. it's okay life's about figuring it. out and i will tell you this. dude this podcast helps me. figure things out and i know. it also is there for you. too sometimes i see you. guys sometimes you come up. with tears in your eyes. and you say thanks for being there. dude i

[ __ ] 30 for the overdraft. fee [ __ ] it and i would do it and i would get overdressed and and every time hortensia would call me and i knew her a lot because it was a bank in la canada. and i stayed there for some reason. even though i lived in burbank. i wasn't in locking. out anymore but i would drive to. i would have to. drive there and make a deposit dude. and this was back before. like all the electronic shits. would have would go down. with your phone you could deposit a check and duchy would call. me and i would never pick. up and every message was the same. and it would always sounds like this. hello chris this is hortense. here from citizensbusiness bank you need to. make a deposit and dude. i remember it okay and that's that. hello chris this is horton this. is hortensia from citizens. business bank you need to. make a deposit that's what it. was and that's what i did. and every [ __ ] time i would drive over and make a deposit and i would go and get it i would go get georgie's and i'm gonna go get the sandwich. from georgie's and one time i i i'll go. get well is this even interesting. whatever it doesn't matter i do what. i want here this is my podcast. listen to it or don't. uh and i went to. uh georgie's and i would always get the club sandwich. just with turkey in it. and no middle bread. i didn't want ham. because i don't like ham. because ham's for suckers. dude even on thanksgiving i. don't eat ham eight hand. by mistake the other day didn't like it secretly liked it. and then got pissed off. and knew it was ham. because it was uh an italian. sub and some they don't normally. put ham in the italian. sub he's supposed to. put the gabagool and the [ __ ] uh salami and all this [ __ ] but the ham was in it and i didn't know that and i liked the whole. thing and then somebody said to. ham was it and i got pissed. off but it's all good. man i don't like ham. they tricked me into. eating the ham and uh and uh so what. was i saying [ __ ] some some childhood. story oh and then i went to. george's and i would get the thing. and then and then they had to. they put the ham. in it and then by mistaken was like yo there's ham. in this and then the owner. got so mad he was like this. guy comes in all the time. and he doesn't get ham. you [ __ ] it up and you put the ham in there and i felt bad for the lady. i think she still works there. honestly did they sell georgie's. i have no idea it was a great. place we would go we would go to. lunch in high school. um oh [ __ ] i love being on the road man. i love being on the road. and doing my shows i'm very grateful. i'm very happy well. enjoy your thanksgiving you know. look at this going back. to the turkey building. animal rights proponents who who animal. rights of proponents who oppose the use of animals. in sports claim that turkey bowling. is disrespectful to. animals and sends mixed messages. which may encourage violence. to animals or people dude. i the the sometimes the animal rights. group are are right. but what they get upset. about is is the wrong. thing about it like it. doesn't encourage violence to. animals or people it's just disrespectful. to roll a carcass down. the aisle where cleaning detergent. is do you know. what i mean it's like another. objection is perceived disrespect to. the central attribute of thanksgiving. the all these organizations you know. such [ __ ] in 2003 an upcoming. event for the title. of uk great. turkey bowling champion at manchester. evening news arena was protested against by. animal rights campaigners as a result plastic. turkeys were used instead of real frozen. turkey as well made for probably a worse. game i gotta be honest. in 2007 an animal sanctuary. rescued a live turkey which was in a cage. from a turkey bowling event. in new york state wow that's amazing. dude just [music] come. on tiptoeing like ace ventura gotta. get this turkey out dude. before they bowl with it dude. did they'd be amazing if they rescued. the carcasses come on if it gets done in the [ __ ] frozen it's a booby high one right because it's frozen and they never had those in the middle come on go wrong side. hey wrong side with the night. vision come on um there. they are okay grab them. [ __ ] there's just me and you i guess we can only get like three or four well whatever it's better. than nothing but they're already. dead you should have to. [ __ ] up this at the point let's go and then they go to. run and they slip on the soapy water. that they use turkey bowling. in yesterday and they [ __ ] die. and then they're a carcass and then people use them. the next day at night shyamalan. [ __ ] or uh what do you call that cabinet of curiosities. whatever that [ __ ] new uh gamble del toro [ __ ] is dude. gamer territoro makes great [ __ ] but but that series it's so weird. he's trying to do like an alfred. alfred hitchcock thing it's so boring. and he comes out in the beginning. and talks and it's awkward. dude give me the toro. talks and he's just like and it's so funny too because he tells the story about what's gonna about to. happen which you never need. to know do in storytelling and then he always says this. one is directed by this. guy and he does that. because he's a director and he wants to. give a director to cut it. and that irks me i have problems. all good gonna talk to. a chair and pretend it's my mom. um what other animals are in. sports by the way. oh look at all these protesters cry. foul at turkey bowling. ice hockey bosses were forced everything. plans to stage the country's first. circuit bowling ah boy. they called foul you know. that's absolutely incredible um so i think that uh through the holidays. i'm actually gonna uh do um the episodes. are not going to. be as long uh i know sometimes. i do like an hour. 20 minutes um and i'm just [ __ ] gonna take time to.
