[ __ ] just falls to. the wayside and so i was in pasadena man. that ice house club is amazing. i met johnny buss who's. the [ __ ] owner of the lakers. and he was there cuz he owns. the ice house now um which was [ __ ] wild as [ __ ] to. meet him nicest [ __ ] and the ice house. that club is awesome. man if you're in pasadena pasadena area. or even if you go. to like the comedy. store in la you gotta go. see sometimes and go see the [ __ ] ice house. man it's such an it's an historic was it. the first comedy it. was like one of the it. was like it's old as [ __ ] but it's really nice and that room is electric so don't you go to. the ice house you do. material and it kills so hard. and then you go over. and do it in the comedy. story you're like oh this doesn't work. dude the crowds are i don't know. what it is about rooms. and [ __ ] that just make they make people it's conducive to. left or like the laughs actors like that. the laughs actors like that the the the ice. houses like that but bro. the comedy store and the improv. are not like that like you go. up on the improv. you could have a good or bad. night depending on the crowd. but if you go up at the comedy. store and you're not funny. you eat [ __ ] period. doesn't matter if the rooms. good or not if you're not funny. at the comedy store eh. [ __ ] i feel like the comedy. cellars that way too although i haven't. played as much as i have the comedy. store but yeah something about these rooms. that hold like 110 like the cot. like the comedy store original. room holds like 110 or 120. in the comedy cellar i was like [ __ ] 90. anyway so i did the the the the ice. house it's a great a great. room and then and then i [ __ ] did you see the oscars. man i've watched parasite and i loved that movie. but i thought the main good thing about that. movie was the the screenplay. and i thought it was directed great. and all that acting was really great. i [ __ ] liked the movie and then this guy tweeted this thing about it's such a bad tweet john miller. is at miller stream a man. named bong joonho wins oscar for best. original screenplay over once upon. a time in hollywood. in 1917 acceptance speech was great. honor thank you then he proceeds to. give the rest of his speech in the korean. these people are the destruction of america. that's so bad to. say you know like just straight up what are you. saying hey dude trying to. dig your own grave see it's interesting. that like mmm trump has really brought these [ __ ] out you know bring him out. bring him out that's what their be. yelling when the barrels in the mouth. that i wouldn't you know. that song that jayz song. never knew what he was saying. burrell i was like burrell he's saying barrel. i wish he just said that's what just say. saying when the barrels in your mouth. why doesn't he do that. why i don't know why. does he say i i ain't. into like him do his no. way why does he say that. in a song don't know. but he does yeah ha. ha since secure. always how he laughs it's ok ok ain't. into like into. it's no way anyway um set without the jews. that's why the jews bought out. a property should have bought a property. in dumbo but i did. it cuz did you bought it and now. kicking myself ain't into. like in dudes no way. so yeah and then i wrote g. jesus i wrote well there's a ridiculous. tweet jesus christ it's weird. to think like extremely left. and then also it's weird. to think extremely right. like when then you see people like [ __ ] what's that girl's. name bryn [ __ ] who's the girl who played captain marvel and she's just like a guy looked at me now and you're like kylie let's just meet in the middle. i you know or or or joaquin. phoenix acceptance speech where he's just like thanks. for the oscar don't drink milk. casey yeah thanks thanks for the oscar. thanks for the oscar. stop squeezing cows casey yeah pivot pyung. whether we're talking there's a part where he was like whether we're talking about. black people or cows like and how do we not miss that. like it's all because we love o'keefe he was a super talented. guy and obviously his heart. is in the right place. and obviously he's such a great. [ __ ] guy just cares about lots of [ __ ] but like if i went up there like if i for some reason went up and was just like guys thanks so much for the oscar this is amazing but also black people and cows need rights you'd be like kay we should to. give him the oscar. whether we're talking about koreans. or animals like hey how did we miss it. it's because dude you give people they make it. they make they like if the rock said it. it would be okay. if a comedian said it they'd be done. dude if rogen or anybody went up. there and just were like said what he said. they'd be like why is he comparing black people. to cows um these acceptance speeches. are just a love joaquin phoenix i'm not even talking about. his but these acceptance speeches. are just [ __ ] so awful you know once they get to. that point you're oh great. oh great no well i'd like to. thank this person that. person i'd like to. thank that and you know. once they get to. that point you're like oh here it. comes the destruction of the end. oh boy and the thing is in the rights. and if you we've got war. and oh you are wearing a one. hundred and seventy thousand. dollar dress okay bye what. if he just really did went up. said you know he walked up. said thank you so much. black people and cows need rights. and [ __ ] in in it nickname. you need a lien on a nickname. next up the even the guy. who does the next. up okay oh okay. well next up [ __ ] colin firth is gonna gives you a boy gives the award. for best picture that's him. doing king's speech for those. of you that haven't heard the [ __ ] god some this i should have just called this podcast sounds um so yeah man these i don't know i don't know how but but but this guy what i don't understand. the problem with bong joonho winning. and then saying great honor. thank you and then these people destruction of america. he went up to. tweet john miller went on. to tweet these people are obviously not koreans. but those in hollywood. a warning a for a foreign film. that stokes flames of class warfare over. two films i thought were more. does irving lee simply reserving. simply to show how woke they are oh that. should be clear from the rest. of what i tweeted about tonight's direction. you know okay man you don't vote. for that you're the host of something. on blaze tv yeah now. i think um i don't know who this. guy is whatever fine i'm sure. maybe his hearts in the right. place i have no [ __ ] idea but sounds bad tweet sounds bad also if you're gonna argue anything about any screenplay. that was that to. me and i i didn't see all. the movies but that was that movie's. screenplay was so good if you have a gripe with that movie and and it's the screenplay. i don't know where your [ __ ] head. is man it's also not like to. say that he won because hollywood. is woke i guess maybe why cuz he's korean i guess. i don't know weird weird. that he's saying that weird. they just pick in that. battle i think cuz that movie. was [ __ ] awesome and how cute was the guy who won it. when he won he was just like oh and then he [ __ ] was like talking about all the other guys who were when he was like martin scorsese. you know i i can't believe i'm standing it. with you or whatever. the [ __ ] he said i don't know it doesn't matter but it was cute. as [ __ ] man god that guy looks so polite god. bah bong joonho looks so. polite he looks like he's. never [ __ ] eating something. and gone yeah even if it was. gross he's so polite like he [ __ ] for sure eats at people's houses. and he's like what a wonderful. meal the whole time but no matter. what it is they'll be like this. is a car this. is this is the cardboard [ __ ] this is a cardboard and he's like ah what a wonderful meal. that's how he looks have you. guys seen the host it's so good. and snowpiercer is so good that. movie should have been [ __ ] you guys guys he's snowpiercer it's so good with chris evans but i got it i wish i could see that movie again. i never watched movies twice.
