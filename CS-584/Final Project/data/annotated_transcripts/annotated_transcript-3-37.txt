marco. was going like this so don't look good nobody knows. but it's and but it's okay dude. whatever i don't need hats. you know why why's that. because i don't need to. cover the top of my head. because i'm not jewish. well only for jews religiously you don't need to. come you're jewish that's the thing. well that has nothing to. do with anything uh our grandmother was maybe. jewish she was adopted. we don't know and we'll never know. so here we go. dude we're going to. be going on to. the um like we're going to. be doing a lifeline show. right now i mean. uh you did your show. we're going to be doing lifelines. we don't know if our grandma's jewish. or not because she was adopted. we think uh the facts. are still out there and we'll never know. jesus religion but anyway keep going what's that. jewish is a religion i know. why is butters on the desk. but not better cameras come here. butters come on come here come here. come here yeah yeah likes me. more good boy good boy. good boy always do. what i say so um all right. well let's do it uh let's get into. it let's get into. it let's get involved. okay what's your chicken vault. hey what's going on chris sup. matt so seth here out of washington i'm 22. years old and for the past. five years i've been dealing. with this condition on my lips. called exfoliative chilitis can't tell right. now but it's a cycle of excessive peeling. on the lips it. gets pretty bad i've let it. get in between me and relationships. and work in the past. i'm starting to. come to terms with it. now since i have tried dermatologists all their recommendations no. remedy solved it no steroids. no antifungal creams i even did. a yeast infection. cycle treatment that didn't fix. it either and i'm starting. to come to terms with it. i still could use a little bit of help. on how to. kind of accept it more. be less ashamed of it. maybe you guys have something. similar but i love you. all i appreciate y'all and i look forward. to the day your dad's on. the podcast oh because advice. man appreciate you buddy. i appreciate you buddy. don't worry about your lips. worry about your ceiling it's super. weird so um well i think that uh get the [ __ ] black phone mask have you seen black phone i haven't seen it hooks. around his ears and it's like this. that would be scary. though or scare people out. in the world well but probably but at least at least. they go oh [ __ ] yeah oh you must be a big black phone fan or oh oh my god you must be a big ethan hawk fan but you won't. be like what's going on. with his lips that's way. better right so either. get that mask or the [ __ ] huge one with the with the dick. nose on the uh what's the tom cruise. movement nicole kidman uh eyes. wide shot yeah yeah yeah yeah oh oh the black and white. and get up and get a big cape. and walk around and bring one. of those boom boxes that. just goes why did you do. uh gregorian chant like it. was like a twangy deliverance thing. no no no no but that's what the gregorian. chat is no gregorian. channel sounds like a growing chance. not like it's from deliverance. but also no way but that's not what i'm doing. that's what it sounds like. how i'm not doing quick. notes with the huge difference blocking his chapped. lips and then also turning. people on you might get a chick. like that have we talked i mean. you're going to get so mad. but have we talked about what those. masters were really for to. begin with why they exist. to keep people away. from you no during the black death. the plague the bubonic plague. when all the bodies. would pile up in the middle of town. or in the houses like one out. of two people were basically [ __ ] dying nonstop yeah rotting flesh. was everywhere the only way. people could get rid of the scent. was to wear masks. like that and stuff them. full of like flowers and fruit so that. the scent from this big. dick nose thing could overpower the scent. of all the rotting flesh. around them i know that oh okay. well why'd you let me. tell you also so didn't [ __ ] know the look on your face that's not how people react all of your knowledge is now based on what happens in the tudors sam neil does it. dude sam neil said the tutor samuel's. in the beginning of it. and he's the [ __ ] uh the the um not the pope. but the way they call it. the cardinal yeah and he and he walks around. with like a handkerchief and he's just like when he's all around. the poor people and he's just like yes. yeah so we need to. cross we need to. make these luck yes the church. and the state should not join. yes he says we need to. do this it's separate and i'm going. to walk you talk to. you oh [ __ ] walkietalkie yes yes the church. and the state has happened. we need to make this. allah we need to. put those laws into. effect you know what i would do dude. i wouldn't have one of those. big dick noses with the highass collars. you keep the you keep the [ __ ] scent. coming from you with the high. callers and the and the dick. nose right and i wouldn't use. flowers i would have this like this. i would just be walking. around like that because coffee. smells amazing okay but it was oh it would overpower that you had to. like try to. just stick flowers in the nose. why don't they just i guess. it wasn't enough dude. i don't know and breathe. it through the mouth i mean. it tasted bad probably it was so overpowering apparently. i mean dead bodies. everywhere rotting flesh all. over i don't think that we can imagine what. that might be like i think they knew. what they were doing i don't think that. was their first idea oh it smells. bad oh i got a good idea. make a thing that looks like i got a big. dick on my nose and stuff. it with flowers and fruit and rose water. okay they go like this. oh man it smells so bad. out here they are are you. thinking what i'm thinking and they go. like this dick nose masks. ranking just moment. on all people and then some people nom nom and then some people water. so many sounds dude francisco [laughter]. but what about the guy. dude what about the guy. get one of those masks. get um i mean for real. though he said he's on his way. to coming into. terms with it i think whatever you're doing. that is helping you come to. terms with it keep doing. that and then you will become pimp and pimping. and when you're pimpin. pip and everyone will not even notice. because your energy will be that. of someone at peace i mean. pimp and pimping right. now so once you're at peace. the energy off of you will. counter balance whatever you're worried. about on your face. like if that's the thing now. like true when people here's the thing. when i was young. i went to. school with um an albino kid. and uh at first he was when we were really young. he was like real embarrassed. of it and it made it didn't make the kids. make fun of him. and obviously it wasn't the kid's. fault that he got made fun. of but like it i think it. exacerbated the issue because once he kind of got a little older. he started to get like more. bold about it yeah and then the kids. stopped not only making fun of him. but like it almost like it seemed like he stopped noticing that he was yeah. yeah i'm the albino guy. deal with it right. pretty much yeah and so uh if you can get to. that kind of head space. about your lips i'm sure. it's i'm sure it's not as bad. as you see when you yeah. yeah yeah yeah which is always how it is yeah. yeah yeah of course you got bad. [ __ ] i mean when i was younger i had really i had pretty bad acne for like a year and dude really i would always be like [ __ ] everyone's gonna see this ah and then i would talk about it like to. mom and mom would be like where where is. this yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah my mother's blind. but yeah so um all right. cool well that's good yeah. or you could just go. get a sundan suntan all the time. and then be peeling all. the time and they want to. get yourself make it blend. in yeah yeah all right. let's do it dude. next one got a gun right. here man chris my question. today has to. do with navigating sibling relationships in adulthood. so serious but i feel like you guys are uniquely. qualified to answer. um well i'm 30 my brother's two and a half. years older i'm definitely more than that. in this dynamic you know meaning like i definitely have the better. singing voice he has uh three sons so he's raising. like three kids he's got a lot. going on and um i'm well aware. he like doesn't have a lot. of time and like i don't want to. eat into like the little amount. of time he has yeah uh but with that. being said um also very interested. in maybe like nurturing like uh a newfound like. relationship at this point in our. lives we aren't i wouldn't describe. our relationship as very close. but um you know we're fellow. travelers we like it's all love so. um yeah how does the how does the relationship. between youtube work like how do you guys. navigate that and um any suggestions. would be great so yeah. thank you for taking my question. and thanks for the show. what why don't you show. interest in his family. and like be like let's you know. what i mean like um auntie. so and so like let's all hang out their auntie. wants to see them. you know oh auntie i. thought you're saying anti like negative. no no i'm antiyou i won't hang out. with you i'm antichildren auntie. auntie auntie auntie like yeah you know i like twitter um yeah or yeah yeah exactly i mean she says they're not super close so maybe make more of an effort to. try and be spend time with him. i mean look they are your nieces and nephews. right is that what it. is um so of course i mean. just yeah just basically of course i only know brother. sister mother father and beyond. that uncle ant and then beyond. that i kind of don't really know. oh niece or nephew then you're stupid. but i know if i think about it. but like brother bam i know. that like if you're like if you're like yeah. if somebody's like oh my niece and you're like so at your mom. you're you're and then who cause it. could also be somebody you married. this person or that. or your brother's you know. what i mean yeah but basically you're one of those kids. that's like oh i'm so good. at addition and subtraction but like multiplication is hard. like everyone's good at addition and subtraction because yeah it's so [ __ ] easy yeah i'm not good at uh addition and subtraction oh okay well then you're an even bigger idiot. than i realized so but it's all good. i think that um i think that yeah. that's the thing well they said they're not. super close why don't you since. he has limited time try and include yourself. into things that he's doing in the beginning. because it sounds like you're interested. in i don't know if he's interested. in it or not. but you are their auntie. and so why don't you try. and be like hey if you guys are going to. lunch or dinner i'd like to. go with you guys or whatever. i'll take out i don't know. what your [ __ ] skriller situation. is but like you know. what i mean let's let's try. and like build a relationship. this morning do they have sports. practices games they go. to you make a sign let me know what their schedule. is i would love to. come and like put in some quality. time yeah take them out. on your own go you're my i think. niece and nephew maybe oh wow. doesn't know you know uh but he's definitely my. brother pizza after the game. right yeah there you go. roundtable pizza yup yup. um yeah that's i think that's the way. to do it yeah. yeah yeah yeah [ __ ] yeah dude that was good. advice i give good advice okay. well don't like you know this. is episode [ __ ] 21 already. i know and i often get so surprised. when you give good advice. okay next one hey chris and matt. my name is jason. i'm 27 currently a student. at san francisco state university. um i'm on campus a lot. walking around and uh i get approached. by a christian group who is trying. to like recruit me. or something and keep asking me. someone still telling the bible. study and uh you know. i've been polite to. say no thank you i'm not interested. but uh i've been kind of wanting. to respond in a funnier. way and maybe tell them that i'm i can't. make it because i'm on my way. to a blood sacrifice to. worship satan or just. maybe just reply hail satan. and walk away right you know but i don't know if that'd be appropriate. or polite you know. anyways i just want to. know what you guys would do. would you continue trying to. be polite it happens. like every time i'm on campus. and it's really awesome um or would you you. know respond with some comedy and just do something. that makes makes you laugh. they probably wouldn't laugh they'd. probably be upset. about it so it wouldn't be nice but it'd be funny. anyways just thought i'd throw that. out there appreciate you guys love. the work you do keep it up. thanks what's up with uh he goes. to a like a religious. school is that what it is. i don't think that's what he said. no oh then that's even more annoying. yeah they're just there i think he's at a school. because it's like prime candidates. young vulnerable people just like cult. yes but i think uh the thing to. do to save yourself time. but also get that sort of like comedy. thing that at least what what being funny. provides you can still get the same. thing if like say they approach you and you know. they're coming you know what they're gonna. say just keep walking but as you keep walking. just say nope nope nope. nope nope nope it's a very mad. thing to do yeah. or be like how about you don't be religious. you join my side. right yeah hey here's a no make pamphlets that's a good. idea not not religious this. like you know what i mean. yeah like you make up. your own religion or you know. the nonreligion here you go. join my [ __ ] yeah yeah make your own really join my [ __ ] religion well but well you're do why because i'm already well okay so i'm already okay so didn't say any nouns. we're both already didn't say. any nouns do you know what i mean. but that's so annoying i mean that's the most annoying. thing yeah i'm glad you asked. dude i've been wanting to. talk to you about the church. of guy who touches his hat. too much yeah that's who he was yeah. would you like a would you like a ball. cap yeah yeah you know. how jews wear yarmulkes. brought it up twice. maybe chris chris and matt's grandma. was jewish we don't know because she was adopted. brought up three times um yeah i think you can look they're approaching. you about their religion. religion at least used to. be one of the most private things. in the [ __ ] world now people talk about their religion. and politics like it's their [ __ ] favorite kind of juice. or meal lunchtime when did religion. be when was it the most private thing. in the world though because two things. you don't ask about was was. your religion and your politics. when i don't mean like [ __ ] 1400s because in the 1400s. this [ __ ] was really really prevalent and everyone knew who everyone was because everyone was one. thing or else you would be. killed dead or you'd either. basically be wearing crosses or have. no head right so they'd be like oh you've got a cross or you're catholic. or you're christian or oh. that guy's got no head. so he must have been a jew. or something or something yeah. yeah uh well luckily we don't live. then but no i mean like in the 50s and before. like right it was impolite. the 1950s i assume you would get an answer. when you asked somebody what. their [ __ ] religious beliefs were and there's something to. that it's it's like it's it. seems so bold to. be like to. expect other people to. openly talk about the religion. or politics for that matter. yeah but you know. i think you can so they come up. to you politely but what they're doing. is rude yeah so you can be as rude. as you want it doesn't matter. how like polite they come. yeah the thing it's like being nice when you're stabbing. someone you're still stabbing them so. when [laughter] uh but yeah be as rude. as you want to. meet you and being rude. to someone like that is funny. so you get a little bit of a dummy double. whammy um oh here's another good. one hey uh i'd like to. talk to you about it. to try and convert. you to my religion. oh oh are we gonna [ __ ] whoa that seems okay keep going oh we're getting married. oh my god okay are we getting. oh right dude right. we're getting married right. and then they say no you say then what the [ __ ] does my religion. have to do with you. okay it's a bit of a stretch but i still like what. you're doing spin around and then you show. them that spin move mentality hoodie. knew that was coming well. we're predictable but mostly it's it's good. that we have the spin move now. people can get the hoodie. to have the the words on. their body backing up that's right. coinciding with the action that's great. i never really realized that. baby oh my dude. i'm very creative okay. all right let's go. to the next one. what's up man chris this. is brady coming to. you live from my stinky. community college in keller texas and i have that theo. vaughn

[ __ ] calls the police that's the big thing like what if you really [ __ ] them up you get right like you don't manslaughter dude curb stomp them right i just think there's too many things that could go wrong plus. it's not a good look. after that you know. 30 like a [ __ ] month six months a year the as time goes on you're gonna less and less like the fact that you did that yes oh totally just a hundred percent you're gonna be 60 and you're gonna be talking to. your kids yeah like you know. your father regrets something. yes exactly yeah i need to. get it off my chest. i don't know why you'd

who i have an eightyearold daughter. and my fiance is an amazing. you know going to. be an amazing stepdad they get along. great and he's so good to. her so my fiance and i have talked about if we should have a kid. of our own and the problem. that i see with that is that i'm about to. turn 35. so i worry that maybe i'm just a little bit. too old and i don't know. i mean i see women. doing it all the time. now over 35 so am i too. old or is it. okay to you know. still try to have. another one because pregnancy gets a little dicey after 35. so yay or nay pregnancy but it's not really after 35. it's not really that you're not doing that you're not 45. you're good honestly. i was just going. to say this i have a really good friend. his sister at 45 with no. help of any kind of outside thing. she just got naturally pregnant. had a natural pregnancy and the baby. turned out fully [ __ ] healthy with no [ __ ] complications 45 years. old that's 10 years older. than this woman i'm not saying. every woman can do that. but dude 35 you're good that's just at the very beginning. of the time when they say you really. should start thinking about hurrying. up this process yeah also what do you think your life. looks like in 10 years. imagine that what do you want. and then also right yeah also you could try. and let the let jesus christ. sort it out right. i mean you know what i mean. that's the other thing you don't need. i'll tell you what it. was blurred let them splurge let jesus. christ figure it out the fact that she's even asking makes me think she doesn't want to. because it's such to. me it's such an obvious. yeah give it a shot. that it's almost like if she's asked for advice. it's like no i think she i said it. though yeah but it seems like she's actually wants to. be talked into it to. me well then she should and then take it. take our advice absolutely do. it let him splurge let him split. let the lord figure it out dude. yeah right you know what they say. let him support and let the lord. figure it out yep. just be like huh. well constantly let jesus figure it out. constipated oh that's what did you go. like that could you agree. yeah oh i

[ __ ] up and work hard at being a comedian um also get your [ __ ] in check also if you do stand up and you are great when you're blackout drunk what are you gonna do get blackout drunk. every time you go up on. stage well that's what i'm saying. about living fast and [ __ ] but here's the other thing too dude. people romanticize that thing. man if you were to. go back and ask everybody. who [ __ ] died at 40. or whatever uh was that fast. life worth it they're dead. so they can't answer but if they could they'd say [ __ ] no man you want to. see your daughters grow up. your [ __ ] sons grow up you want to. see your your fam you you don't want. to die before your [ __ ] mom and dad this sucks man. like addiction's hard as [ __ ] [ __ ] i'm actually [laughter] just stop uh drinking too much and stop knowing it's hurting your liver and then you can be better. at everything and not be wasted. all the time because no one likes i mean. this guy's like everybody. loves me when i'm drunk. i guarantee you they don't. yeah other guys who enable you and are. also drunk love you when you're drunk. and it's also annoying man you're probably annoying. trust me yeah you're annoying. when you're drunk okay i used to. drink all the time. i'm not even sober i just. stopped drinking because i i but i believed i wasn't annoying. i believed that was the life. of the party but trust me. i was annoying [ __ ] yeah i know that because i see drunk. people now and i'm like this. [ __ ] thinks he's the life of the party he is instead of being the life of the party the death of the party he is [ __ ] annoying yeah you're like the guy that brings out the guitar in the middle of the [ __ ] party that everyone's having fun at you're like okay i guess we're gonna [ __ ] listen to. some [ __ ] by weezer now that isn't even good like here's the other thing man. like coming from someone who absolutely has. an addiction problem you gotta figure your life. out man you got to. do it for you it's [ __ ] so hard but you can do it um i don't know i would suggest getting a group of people that are willing to. help or a 12step program. um and it's not easy it's [ __ ] hard. and if you want to. do the work then do both works. try and be surprised and so far and try. and be a comedian. and also try and live your life. true um and not and not drink and die. and affect everyone around. you and now yeah not blackout. drunk also don't you want to. remember some of your [ __ ] life like if you're blackout drunk. just because you can make people laugh. in your life for the party. and as you say beautiful. women like you more it doesn't matter. if you can't [ __ ] remember it who are you doing this for other people or you it's yeah that's true. it's also not what people like you for trust. me bro i thought people liked me because i was the guy. who would come in and get all the [ __ ] ladies and be cool. and i was charismatic and i was funny. but dude that's not why. people like you man. like people like you because you're you and you matter. and it took me a long time. to figure that out so he was kind of being a piece. of [ __ ] to. me in the beginning now. so i don't think people like him. for him maybe he's better. when he maybe he's better. when he's drunk it's funny. dude because i get a lot. of videos that call me. matt's brother so i think we're even yeah. but if you go look at the youtube. comments everyone's like wow matt and his brother. are amazing so thanks. for that buddy all right. let's do the next one. how do you guys think you should spend. your late 20s or early. 30s oh i mean expanding expanding it into. your 40s could be into. your mid 50s what do. you think you should do with your life. that's around the zone where you need to. start settling in and [ __ ] honing in on the things that you might want long term when you're in your early or even mid twenties not only is your brain still actually developing our brains don't stop developing until we're 25. which is pretty [ __ ] crazy mine's. still going man but it'll be so smart. it's not done forming until. we're 25 so not me take that. apply that to your actual life. i think we can all feel. free to sort of like [ __ ] around. and see where we go. until we're 25 maybe even to. our late 20s but around. the late 20s and certainly into. your early 30s you want. to at least have begun developing that path. that you feel like you could be on for the rest. of your life or realizing. that the paths path or paths. that you've been on are not really for you. and try to. move on from those and try. to find a new one. but i think that you know. there are these people you know my age. mid to late 30s. that is mate both is. the fact uh that are [ __ ] like still spinning their wheels being [ __ ] jackasses like the guy in the previous video and like they don't they don't really have the direction in their life that and it's not like they're [ __ ] up their life it's just like i look at them a little differently. than i do or did people. or my peers in their early to. mid 20s because by then. you should kind of be figuring your [ __ ] out. a little bit more uh and most people do but there are those. people that don't and i i think the key. is to avoid being one. of those people i'm not saying you gotta have everything. [ __ ] figured out yeah and you can also change what you're gonna do yeah exactly have some sort of a plan i think is the main thing you have a plan that you're on the path toward executing. yeah people change their [ __ ] when they're 45 and 50. and 55 and that's fine. but have a plan and and take be taking action into. it you know um that that's my advice. but you know i i don't you know. i don't know how old you are. it sounds like you're i guess. you're probably in that late 20s. yeah he looked like he's the late. 20s yeah um so yeah. yeah he's also a crazy. guy because the way he began. he's lurch so he's from the adams. family so that's good yeah. all right next one i guess. first of all frips a second. my question is for chris i'm going. back to perform after the pandemic. i make electronic music. and so the question is if you have any advice. for for yeah for going back. to perform live in front of a crowd. after such a long break. thank you man ciao nice and short. let me just before you answer. nice and short kept. it concise kept the energy. up got specific enough but didn't get too. specific didn't carry on didn't [ __ ] much go on and on and we loved it thank you. very much it was. much shorter than this um yeah so what you sh. i well okay so i'm assuming. it was the pandemic probably that. why he stopped yeah performing so only i'm only. assuming that because that's literally the words. he said oh did he say that. yes yes uh well dude first of all it's been done. i mean i know it's still going. on but like this is just how it's gonna be for the rest of the [ __ ] however long yeah like in the tutors there. was a place was there's a stop talking about the [ __ ] tudors but there was a plague. that lasted four different it. had four different swells and it took. a few years and it might be like the tudors. but what i'm saying for him. is yeah uh he's saying live venues like big. crowd big crowd [ __ ] for him haven't really returned yet. and they're starting to. so he's talking about how did you make that. adjustment to starting to. get back into the swing. of things with big crowds and the energy. and and just i think everyone can. relate even if they're not performers. like getting back into. the normal swing of things. all in you got to. go all in 100 because here's the deal. you can't tippytoe around covet and i'm not. [ __ ] i know i joke. around about don't push me but like if you want. to be safe and put a mask on. and you're out in public. i think you should i don't think you're a [ __ ] idiot for wearing a mask do. what makes you feel safe. right but no but some people do some people like shame. like oh you [ __ ] mask you. know i mean you know yeah. i guess i haven't really seen that. [ __ ] those people yeah yeah yeah if you want to. wear one wear one i don't give a [ __ ] but like um although when people have them on when they're in their cars with nobody that's freaky that's weird as [ __ ] and i talk about i have that a joke. about that kind of a thing. in my ass steal my.

[ __ ] constantly kidding me. with the tudor's thing. i'm on up i'm on i'm on the fourth. season do you do anything. else during the day. other than watch the tudors. yep night time i watched. the tutors how many episodes. have i seen no like a per. night oh three and for how many nights. there's like eight seasons of that. show right now four wow i'm almost done how are you how are you not done. yet i'm almost done i i watch it. when i don't have something to. do if i don't have a show and then sometimes. i even come home and i watch the tutors and they're just [ __ ] everybody. and cutting each other's heads. off but my point. is it's not good it's fine. but but it's okay you did. what you did don't feel bad. about it you know. you guys had horizontal mambo. fires yeah who cares. if your sister's mad at. you have that conversation with her. whoopsie daisy sorry but don't like feel. too yes so i you know. okay i i didn't know you you would people bother. you that much or i [ __ ] up or if there was a rule that you shouldn't have then been like you know what i'm sorry. and then go for the other girl but if there's not it's okay. and choose the one. that you want to. choose and err on the side of whoever's closer. to you which is not your sister's. friend right right you didn't [ __ ] up that you didn't even really [ __ ] up on it no you didn't know you'll be fine uh and uh are you not in a lot you're not really in a love triangle are you he kind of is i mean. it's a very loosely def. i mean i would wear like a pentagon well. no it's like it is because it's him. and the two women i understand. but it's it's it's like a little it's not like boom. boom they're all involved it's like certainly wouldn't be. a little love puddle. it wouldn't be like in a script. it's not dramatic enough you're in a love. puddle but it's uh yeah and twitter would look at that. script and you would be like not for me. and walk away love puddle that's that's good. that's a good term for it. yeah um but yeah again. anytime you're in a situation like that everybody's always like oh god. what do i do there's just two women. there's these two men. i know what you do. you choose the one you like more. yeah but some i get sometimes. do you like people two people the same. i don't know if you like two. people the same then you're not in love with either. one of them oh dude. be dj go to. take the one you love. and go to. a dj black death. concert yeah that's definitely true. but if you don't know which one you like you don't really. like either one of them that much and maybe what the [ __ ] is that and maybe you don't like yourself. okay well that's totally a different level. i guess that's always possible. yeah so that doesn't apply. to what we're talking about. it could yeah it could but so can you henry. anything you know um all right. uh well that's that's good. that's a good episode that's the other episode. thank you for for uh sending. the videos in and uh thank you. and if you have a question. click the link in the description. below or go to. watchlifeline dot com and get your spin get you we have different. merches lifelinemerch dot com and when you get the pimp. and pimpin merch yeah you take pics. tag me on your stories i want to. repost that [ __ ] we're going to. do a who wore it. best lifeline merch dot com. get the pimp and pimping gear. okay put it on your body. take a pimp and pick of you. send it put it on pinpoint. instagram on your stories and tag me. okay and also i'll be in atlanta and dc. and savannah and peoria. and a bunch of different. places go to chrisley dot com. stockton i'll be there so uh kristen dot com. sounds pimpin pimpin everybody. bye guys [music].
