in little rock it's too. hot the thing about little rock. is i i say this. now that i can then i've been there. and i should have said this. on stage while i was there. because i did some stuff on. it and i'm gonna post it. to my youtube uh but little rock. arkansas is you know some people listen. to this overseas and first of all it's little rock. arkansas is you want to. know what little rock arkansas is okay. here it is it's the place. that 48 hours the first 48. that's where it's filmed. the most is for is either. there or memphis okay. um like you turn on the first 48. and it's like little rock. arkansas you're like of course they don't have to. say it anymore. just say when it's not little rock. arkansas oh yeah and this also is in little rock. arkansas anyway we're trying to find out. who did it in 48. hours um so little rock arkansas. is the whitest and blackest place. there is the the mix of super white. and super black in every sense. it's unbelievable dude. you've got like oh first of all all sorts. uh like the the white country. good old boys. that are you got the ones. with like very very hey how's it. going and then the ones that are just like and you're like oh you just spit. on a bird on the ground. and they're like i don't i don't look. what are you here for and then you got we walked through. a it's not just black people. we walked through calvin and i walked through. it was just me and him. i took it was just just dad. and son calvin at little rock. arkansas kristen and williams stayed at a wedding. uh in vermont or something or no uh virginia. i would say vermont i'm not coming to. vermont by the way i'm coming to. virginia i may i may do. vermont at some point but virginia is where i'm going. i always vermont and people hit me up. like where's the vermont date and i just say instead of virginia. because they're both bees and i'm an idiot. um but we went to. this place that was like the riverfront. or something and there was a fullon not just concert. all black people and the most soul first i've ever been a part. of calvin's ever been a part. of but i've ever been a part. of dude i walked i was with calvin. walking through little rock. arkansas and the music kept getting. louder and i don't remember what song. it was but it was some [ __ ] like i'm going down on i'm going down. you know the [ __ ] song or whatever um and some lady. you know some some bigger black. lady was just singing and just killing. it and i'm like we're getting pretty close. we're gonna have to. see what this is all. black people dude and black people just have a good time. you know what i'm talking. about it's just such a good. time and i'm like holding calvin and i'm like i kind of want. to have one of these good times. now i don't like but look i'm not black. and can i do it. and also i don't want to. i hate concerts hannah. but i don't want to. impose that on calvin so what if he likes it. so i walk up and then i realize that literally everybody. is black and i'm talking about there's 300 black people just at the riverfront. just listening to. this lady sing pretty. damn well fullon band and they're all just grooving. to it you know and i walk up. and i'm like i guess i gotta go. in because if i don't i seem racist. right because if i'm like nah not for me. i'm like why not and i don't want calvin. to think like that i want. calvin to be exposed to. everything so i just [ __ ] walk hey i just walk right up i just walked right through and we listened to. some soul [ __ ] dude calvin and i and uh we were grooving a little bit and we walked right. through it was too hot. and then we got there and i realized that. you know what i'm exposing. calvin to all sorts. of cultures and that's great and then calvin goes like this. it's too loud and so we left. so in a way he said black. people are too loud so that's racist. um but i have a resistance. so um we went to. a wedding uh shout out to. mariel and dom who got married. in uh where were we even. new york upstate i never yeah i've been to. upstate new york for shows and we were staying in. like a place it was a i guess. it was a hotel. but there were more

[ __ ] it's such [ __ ] malarkey. and horseshit drew barrymore is. still doing her talk show. the only thing that makes the drew barrymore worse. than the drew barrymore show is no. writers the show's so bad. and she's just like dude. the [ __ ] these actors don't give a [ __ ] about anything but themselves drew barrymore slammed. by hollywood for bringing talk show back. amid strikes um drew barrymore is being criticized. by fellow actors and writers on social media. for a decision to bring back. to drew bremer's show is set. to return april 18th. and then it's that's in the middle. of the [ __ ] strike barrymore is not violating sag afro rules. but yeah no [ __ ] because there's [ __ ] exemptions and also uh so many different levels. of corruption um uh guild contract. for talk shows game shows variety shows and. soap operas was renewed. and ratified in 2022. her show. does employ wga writers this. means that so it has to. go without writers without wga writers or or no. writers dude i'd love to. see if she wings it first in line. to watch it i can't. watch that i can't wait to. watch that train wreck but people are pissed. off like uh you know uh what's his name. from west wing and then the other guy. from the other show i say. it that way because who [ __ ] cares who's pissed off you know uh this person jennifer gross. who spells jennifer with the g. so we can trust her says drew barrymore has always been someone. who would recognized her privilege. and aimed to evolve so i hope. she will reconsider this hasty decision. intended to pay her. crew because it weakens both. unions to openly endorse. scabbing she could personally fund their salaries for eternity. i mean you know like this. is where you lose me. no she can't for eternity. don't ever say eternity. in any argument lonnie love. who i actually [ __ ] love i love lonnie. love she said uh if you're giving if you're giving drew barry. more heat you got to. hit all the other shows. someone is writing still the focus. should be on getting the studios back. to the table so everyone. get back to work she's right. london love is the [ __ ] um oh adam conover that guy who always has something. to say about everything. dude this is incredibly disappointing. drew barrymore shows it employs wga writers who are currently. on strike she's choosing to. go back on the air. without them and forcing her guests. to cross a picket line. drew this arms of writers and all the union. workers please reconsider because like i [ __ ] talks about anything a [ __ ] livable by ben affleck. and it'll be like you know. we need to talk about this. leave situation bradley whitford dude. oh you dude these [ __ ] people just come out. of the woodwork drew barrymore i own. this choice we are in compliance. with not discussing or promoting film. and television that is instruct. that is struck of any kind i don't know. and bradley whitford oh you own. it for sure drew barrymore and we'll never forget. it i love it dude. so good everyone is sucks. you know except lonnie love. i love her um uh anyway dude. god this [ __ ] jimmy fallon. thing is so crazy. the [ __ ] nonarticle is so insane.
