give up that simple a little bit. of elbow pain we. worked through it is it. bad for the body maybe but it's good. for the mind dude because we keep going. now is it good for the mind. yes because we can persevere and get through. it yes do we stop working out. after just one little thing. hurts no we don't do. that and does that is that. confirm until yes and then later on is it. bad for a mental because we dwell. on an es but it doesn't matter. because we also have good fundamental before. that dude so it's also good and you know it's a good and the bad it's again. in the gang really is what it. is it's the yin and the yang. my babies um but yeah dude. uh uh and i guess also there's aliens. hey so it doesn't matter. really if your elbow. hurts right because there's aliens. and now now

book that old book. communion so annoying dude look at look. at look at former military officials. and then people are like we need proof. well of course we need proof man. if you got crazy claims. you need crazy proof i want to. see that alien going. through the friggin uh wendy's drivethrough i want. to see former military officials made a series. of mystifying claims about an unidentified aerial phenomenon. phenomena uh under oath that wednesday's congressional hearing. the hill uh today held. a hearing on unidentified aerial. phenomena also known as uaps. or so when did they start. this uap [ __ ] you're going to. switch it now and now that they're they're admitting. it ufo uap unidentified aerial. phenomena why this is like is this like are they protesting out. there we are not ufos we. are aerial phenomena we are not unidentified flying. objects flying is derogatory we are ariel we identify. as aerial phenomenon not. flying objects that is objectifying us literally calling us objects. we are aerial phenomena. okay dude why do they start. that [ __ ] that's so annoying well i change it when the shit's real now that's super annoying. dude i don't mean to. be hate i'm not hating. but it's like i'm still with that. ufo [ __ ] i'm old school dude people are gonna call me racist alien racist. ufos alien racism rolling. public interest about potential. extrator hey guys shave your head this. guy already you know. committee her testimony from three witnesses. today one was a former navy. commander and the other guy was a former navy pilot. aaron both of them to. have seen uaps as well as intelligence. officer step further and he alleged. that the government well dude. no [ __ ] man it's like they didn't just show up today. i would be there have been aliens. all over the place all the time. and i don't i'm not look. i'm not saying there's aliens. or there's not aliens but there's aliens. you know what i'm saying like there's definitely aliens. because we're not the only things in the atmosphere. that are like you know. bumping into walls and [ __ ] uap i. won't stand for that. i stop with the uap [ __ ] i won't stand. for that i'm not the only being on the planet. that like hits his hip on the side. of an end table and goes. ah we're not the only beings that do that. okay there's absolutely people who do that. that take ufos and a retrieval program. take a listen to. more of what this here. we go if you believe. we have crashed crash here's let. me just this is how they should just answer. the show earlier do we have the bodies. of the pilots who piloted this. craft as i've stated publicly already. in my news nation interviews. so dick as i've stated it already. in my news interview so dick. so pissed off he's here some of these recoveries were they i guess. or nonhuman biologic no. they weren't human we're talking about. aliens right that's why i'm here. that's me answering the question nonhuman. and that was the assessment of people with direct knowledge on the program. i talked to that are currently. still on the program i mean. so many words dude. nonhuman biologics aka alien. for its part the pentagon rejected. those claims for its parts chevy head um nonhuman biologics. mimicking up all sorts of new. words now that this shit's going. on this is a distraction. you know i don't know if i believe that. but this is a distraction. that's what everybody's saying now. this is a distraction. because there's an election. coming up this is a distraction. trump's going to get out. there and be like aliens. we'll kill them all and everyone's gonna be like [ __ ] yeah we'll kill them. all we'll kill all the aliens. and then he's secretly gonna move. that into adding mexicans into. that category you know let's build a wall. and some tasers that's going. to be his new platform. um yeah so i just wonder how the [ __ ] liberals. are gonna spin this alien thing you know. i i can't imagine how these liberals. are going to. spin this alien thing because it's coming. mark my words it's coming. we need to no hey. dude let's just do this. okay and if this is what it. takes me if the aliens. are hearing this i'm sorry. but dude i'm racist when it comes. to aliens stay on. your own [ __ ] planet okay yeah i don't give a [ __ ] even if you look like us stay over there i'm racist. when it comes to. aliens all right i'm gonna die. racist coming i don't want look if you want. people if you want mexicans to. come over the border great. i don't get you know. i don't know i don't really know. the whole logistics of it. but what i do know. is when i meet a mexican. illegal or not i go like this hey man so cool to. meet you nice to. i hope you have a good. day right i'm not racist. when it comes to. aliens dude if we're gonna start. to integrate because the liberals you know that. you know where uh you know. 15 20 years away from like just liberals being like they're people too and the aliens. are just like we are not people. they don't even know we are not. people but let that it's cool. because at least we get to. go to target this way. we don't have target on. our planet and um and uh so but when i see aliens. i'm gonna do all sorts. of racial alien slurs like that's the kind of guy. i am that's who i am i'm the down. south oh racist alien. guy you know crystallia yeah. oh he fell off after the aliens. came to earth and now we're all accepting. the aliens he doesn't accept. them dude he tries. to go out and actively kill. them he says it's in selfdefense but really he's acting
