 [music] hey guys and welcome. to another episode of congratulations. [music] oh yeah now as you notice. this one came out on wednesday. uh and uh that's on p. on patreon on wednesday. and then thursday on youtube. and that's the thing that's going. to be happening now. i know a lot of you guys. were like what the [ __ ] happened to. the podcast but that's what it's going. to be because we are streamlining. the way we do this. and we want it to. be more current sometimes i mention. things in the podcast that happen. uh right when they happen. because we do a podcast. and then later on um it it. it doesn't come out to. like a week and a half. and it's like why the [ __ ] do you care about the super bowl at that point. so we're recording on mondays and then uh we are dropping. it wednesdays and thursdays. so that's much better than we recorded a week. we usually we used to. record a week ahead of time. so it's going to. be a better show i think ultimately um so that's that. that's why it's a day. late it's not actually a day. late it's by design and now this is how it's gonna be from now. on um so that's good. and um we've got merch the don't push me. merch selling like hotcakes you know. everyone everyone is who they are. and when the outside world happens you got to. remain you got to. remember to remain. yourself don't be pushed and that's not your fault. if you get pushed right. that's someone else encroaching on. your space let me be me. basically you're saying and don't push me right. you don't want right chris coming. out or you don't want whoever coming out. right everyone's got their own. version of whatever that don't. push me [ __ ] is um and you know it's the americana design that's all good it's the americana design and you got a hat that people think that maybe you served in the [ __ ] goddamn navy a while ago yeah don't push me but um yeah so that's what's up. dude uh well okay good wow man. you know what it's crazy. i feel like a lot of stuff. happened this week just personally like right. now even just starting off. um i had a we had a a bit of a gettogether for the super bowl. yesterday and then the next day. which is today the place. was a mess kristen. had to study for school. um and she has a test today and so she didn't want. to have to. clean up the place so she went. online and found a place. that comes and um cleans the house. and there was all sorts of [ __ ] like it was a potluck. so everyone had ribs and [ __ ] and it was like cakes. and just wraps everywhere. and so these people came to. do it uh two people two. women uh one younger woman. one older woman and um kristen had to. leave and she was like you gotta deal. with this and i was like okay. i guess i'll deal with. it you know johnny. doesn't deals with [ __ ] but i guess johnny. has to deal with. [ __ ] at this point right because she's got to. go do her thing and study. at the library right. okay could study here but it's all good. that's not for me. to say that's what she wanted. to do that's what she needed. and that's fine all right. so what i uh did. was stay at home. okay um and they show up and the younger woman. you know she's 25 30. or something and she's like uh hi. we're here to. clean the house and i was like okay. cool now we have cleaning ladies. but they work on fridays all. right so she wanted this. [ __ ] done now so they're coming monday. so this is the different. cleaning ladies because the cleaning ladies that we have they're booked solid because they are trustable and that is what you pay. top dollar for i've offered them. to clean other friends. houses and they were like uh and they were like okay. cool how much is it. i tell them how much and they're like oh i could get somebody. to clean this [ __ ] up for 40. and i'm like yeah but that's a crack. [ __ ] you understand right these people trust costs money so when my cleaning ladies ask. for a raise i go. like this okay i guess i'm daddy. warbucks at this point because the trust. costs money right and i trust. them because they've been with me. for 15 plus years okay. and so um now i got these random people come in to. wash my house okay and they're coming and as soon as i got the dogs. locked up now i got four. dogs in a cage right. now four dogs and then i have cooper. okay because our uh uh the uh calvin. is at grandma's house. and we're watching someone else's. dog okay it's just so much. so much [ __ ] is going on it's a lot. okay um and so the the the people come and and cooper's the only one out of the cage. and cooper runs outside when i open the door. and and the young one is like hi. i'm here to. clean the house and the the older. lady is like okay by are you gonna put this dog. up and i'm like hello. uh what she's like you gotta put this dog. up and i'm like oh yeah. okay he's very friendly. i'll just put him i'll put him. upstairs and i hold him. and she's like not coming in the house. and the younger woman is like come. in it's okay he's got the dog. and she's like okay as long as he's gonna put him up. and i'm like i'll put the dog. upstairs it's all good no no. no big deal and so i did that so i was like very weird. way to start. the thing okay very weird. way to start. the thing to. come into a house. thinking that i'm just gonna have attack. dogs fly out and go for your juggler right okay but i understand stranger. things have happened and you're coming into. a foreign stranger's house okay fair. enough i put the dog upstairs and then i come back. down and they're like very they're very nice. okay we're good everything. good this is good the younger. lady says to the older. lady um are you good with cleaning. this and the older lady. says yeah this is easy. and the younger lady says okay i have to. leave and go drop someone else to. another location and i go like this. okay sounds weird but what do i know. i'm not in the cleaning business. what do i know. right i'm not in the clinton business. so now there's one person in my house. and it's for some reason. weirder for one stranger. to be in your house. than two strangers to. be in the house right. because this two strangers. can bounce the [ __ ] off each other. and be strange together but when one of the stranger. leaves all that strangeness that the one. stranger has that's left is directed towards you so now. i got to deal. with the strangeness okay and it's from this. older lady that is like so i go upstairs. and i let her i'm like look the only rooms. we need to be clean. are these two downstairs rooms. and she's like this is a very nice. house a very nice house. here's another thing if you're a stranger. and you come into. someone's house don't compliment their. house makes it feel like you're gonna get robbed. okay don't do that i've seen. too many moves. you walk into. a house all right. wow very nice wow. wow all of a sudden it seems like i'm gonna get held. up at knife point. okay so i said yeah. very yeah nice house. thank you very much i really appreciate it. there's only two rooms you need to. clean so i would go upstairs. i let her do her thing. right because i don't want to. be in the way and i don't want. her to feel like she has to. talk to me or she doesn't have. to talk to. me so she's just cleaning the shits. i'll be upstairs about three or four. times i hear this um so the first time. i hear um i'm like okay. i guess i go down. i go down i say yes hello. and she says hi yeah. um do you have uh trash. bags i thought three would do it. but i need i need more and i say oh sure. yeah they're right here okay. i'm so sorry i'm like it's fine. just trash bags. he's fine go back upstairs. um that this is how she's saying excuse me sir. just like hoping i'm going. to understand the confusion has to. do with me like like i don't know. what the [ __ ] um is for it. could be because somebody came in and slashed her. neck i have no [ __ ] idea um i come down what do you want me to. do with this game she says it's a game. that kristen played last night. with some people i'm like i don't know just put in the box. i guess and then you could just put it under the thing. with the other games. she's like oh over there. i say yeah okay. cool okay so then i'm upstairs for a little bit. and guess what i did. i did some gangster [ __ ] i left. the house for 10 minutes. nobody was in the house. except her but then i felt bad. that i left the house. right i felt bad that. i left the house so i came back in because i was like she could be literally robbing me blind. but i wanted to. trust right i wanted to. trust because she was in my house. and [ __ ] she could kill me so i left the house. and then i felt weird but i came back i came back and when i came back she was. like i'm pretty much done and i said okay. i go upstairs and then i hear um so i come back. down and i say yes and she says i'm so sorry. can i use your phone. for some reason my phone isn't working i said do you want my wifi. and she said sure i gave her my wifi. it wasn't working for some reason. i don't know maybe her phone. is off now so she's like can you call. the person to pick me. up and i say okay. i call her text. her no response yay dude. can you turn my headphones. down yay yay dude no response. yay so now i'm like okay. cool and she sit she's sitting there. and she's like i don't know why. she's not i don't know. why she's not uh picking up. and i said oh okay. well whatever she'll come we'll figure it out. and she was like okay because it's just weird. she's not picking me up. and i'm like don't say that. too much don't say that. too much because then it's absolutely. weird maybe just wait for the ride. and we'll see what happens. and she's like okay so i go upstairs. and then i hear um i come back. down i'm like yes and she says well i tried. to get in touch with the the the business. people and then the other people and you know. i was just helping her. out for a day and i don't even work for her. but i was just helping her. out and this is the last time. i helped her out and i go. uh oh uh oh everything. is unraveling and i'm alone. with this person uh oh i'm a famous. guy uh oh i'm entering. fuckedville okay so i say oh we'll figure it out. don't worry about it and then she was like okay. um and she was like cause i don't know. she knows i have a nervous. condition now she's got a condition. so now she's in my house. alone i'm in my house. alone she's cleaning the house. done with it she did a pretty good job. except for the floors. they're sticky and she says she drops. this i've got a nervous. condition on me so i'm like okay. well is there anyone else. i could call and she said. well did she not call. you back yet i said no. and she said i just don't know. why my phone's not. working this is that doesn't seem to. be my fault and i'm like let's just not. even talk about fault let's not even. talk about fault and she's like do you think you. could drop me off and i said well. no and the answer is just because i mean. there's so many reasons that i'm just going. to lump them all into. because i don't want to. be alone in my house. with you i don't want to. be alone in my car. with you and also i don't want to. drive all the way to. olympic in brea because that's where you need to. go and um so now i'm texting kristen hey great. hire stranger in our house telling me. she's got a nervous condition. hey great hire and she was like okay. it's okay i'm sorry let me be on your team. and i'm like okay then she starts. crying and i don't mean. kristin

[ __ ] five minutes and it wasn't because of any other reason that she thought we were gonna be too late when we were already too late. because of her i yes dude yes man. ladies late and i've got no caffeine. in me ah yes now i feel [ __ ] about complaining because why are we going because we're going to. meet somebody to build us. a house so yes i've got no room. to complain because i'm rich. yes dude but my problems are my problems. and so i say baby. can we just get a coffee. it's on the way and she's like it's going. to take too long. so i pull up the apple i'm. driving and she's like don't text. and drive i said i'm getting. the app so i could just run. in the place get the coffee. it'll save time she's like i don't want you. texting and driving so now. she doesn't want me getting. a coffee and doesn't want me. using the app while i'm driving. because she thinks it's dangerous. and i can't complain because i'm rich. so i'm driving i'm driving on the way. and it's all good i'm like you know. what fine she's like they'll. have coffee there now i don't know. why she's saying it because they obviously don't have. iced americanos at the goddamn architecture. place all they have is bad stale. coffee and that's 100 obvious. and it's fine to. know that but it's not fine. to say that because you know you're just going. to piss me off. more because you know that's not what i want. yes and we keep moving. so we're rolling dude. we're rolling we're rolling and the bloody guts. are getting all over okay. and i realize you know. what i'm in a nice boss. armenian car okay it's okay. cool i'm a bit tony soprano. because i've got the beautiful. tint on i've even got the front. window tint like i said. nobody could tell that i'm that. it might it's my car's time. of the month except for the [ __ ] maybe somebody on southwest airline. in the middle of a flight. right because the [ __ ] this [ __ ] isn't tinted okay so we're going there and we're driving and and and we're driving and we're halfway there we're more than halfway there we're not halfway there we're more than halfway there and kristen says okay well we're going to. be really late and i say well. why don't you email them. since i can't use my phone. because i'm driving and tell them and give them. a heads up that we're going. to be late and she says okay. and i understand that she's a little bit. stung because i said she want. you know what i mean. i'm like well i can't. do it well you said i can't. use the app so what if those are the rules. then i can't be driving and you got to. be [ __ ] doing the thing and she's like okay you got me. i touched it was a little bit. of a touche moment right. so she was like okay. um she's emailing and she's going like this. she's quiet for a little bit and then she goes babe. i say yup and she says the meetings next wednesday. but what do i do. with all this anger well okay. that may be true. sweetheart what do i do. with more than two carryons of anger. i guess we have to. pay extra i guess. we have to check some of these anger. bags now why am i mad. i'm mad because of the shower. thing and i was rushed. and i didn't need to. be i'm mad because i can still be. asleep and i'm mad because we drove. out of our way all the way to. a place that we wouldn't have gone. if it wasn't for this. meeting that oh by the way didn't exist. until the future and why am i mad. i'm mad because i've been being told what to. do not text not. get a coffee and i'm mad. because i didn't get to. do my thing but it's okay. because i've been to. a lot of therapy and johnny. learns a lot okay. so i start kind of just trying. to relax i say nothing. i realize you know what today's. [ __ ] already and it's one of those things where when you realize that the day's [ __ ] like when you realize a day's going badly that's when you're mad but when you realize a day's [ __ ] you're not so mad right because what are you gonna do you're the mayor of fuckedville they voted you in so i just turn right and she starts laughing and she says well i guess we can get a coffee now little bit of a [ __ ] touche a little bit of a [ __ ] you know a shank to. my side but it's all good. it's all good because i'm sitting in bloody guts. anyway turn around start driving. to i guess a coffee. place and all of a sudden we actually get hit with a homing. missile at least that's what it. seemed like what happened was i had. a pop hole pothole i. hit a pothole okay. not pop hole because that's not. what it is but i hit a pothole. and i made a joke. that my tire popped. i go oh my god jesus. i go like that and kristen laughs. and then over my dash. the tire thing comes out. and it starts like all they got they got 47. pieces of air right the psi. they got 47 pieces. of air in my tire. everything's at 47 except for the one. that hit the pothole. it goes 47 46. 45 44 and it's going. down dude and it goes. it gets down to. nine eight and i'm like i pull over dude. it's gone these run flat. time there it's gone dude. i'm rolling on only the rim and so i'm like for [ __ ] sake dude and i said you know this is gonna take an hour and she's like no it's not oh yes it is she thought it was going to. take 25 minutes for triple. a to come and switch. the tire that by the way we don't have because they don't keep it. because they're run flat. tires and you can't put on run. flat tires like that so i had to. get a tow truck and they had to. come three hours later. and they had to. bring it to. mercedesbenz beverly hills and we had to. pretend like we wanted to. go to that shitty coffee. shop for three hours oh no i'm in the mail. and she dressed nicely she dressed. nicely because she wanted to. impress the architect people she dressed in a nice. dress so now we're walking around. this [ __ ] residential area. in the nice dress like we're some [ __ ] hooligans that. are trying to. trick you it was a [ __ ] day dude so now i got two flat tires. in one week all i'm trying. to say is my [ __ ] life's. hard dude life's that guy in the [ __ ] doorway that you're asking to. move kind of like a [ __ ] so it's all good. they fixed it up nice. and uh that's that but let's get to. the [ __ ] [ __ ] i gotta the thing about the [ __ ] uh super bowl is like just okay they're playing the game and all that [ __ ] i would say this man about the halftime show you know there's very rarely a good halftime show and i'm all prepared to. just think about how [ __ ] it's gonna be but this halftime show [ __ ] ripped when 50 cent [ __ ] came down off the thing i was like jesus. christ dude by the way have you ever tried to. hang upside down have you ever. actually got on like an inversion table or something. like that it feels like your eyes. are going to. pop out of your head. and your ears are going to. explode so how the [ __ ] can [ __ ] chubby scent do it i mean dude he was upside down by the way he looked big enough i know everyone's making fun of him they're all doing that hacky joke. [ __ ] oh it's not 50 cent he's a dollar now okay i get it. fine funny ha ha so many people did the same joke. that's just one of those. jokes that you type in how come while you're typing you don't. realize oh everyone's going to. be out there google it. first they're doing it too but he did. a [ __ ] upside down hang and he what is he [ __ ] 250 at least bro how did his head not pop open for real he was like you can find me in the club just [ __ ] upside down and i made a joke. about how like he didn't even know. he's a part of the [ __ ] [ __ ] um when we were at the thing we were at the [ __ ] super bowl while watching it and i was like oh this is how he woke up in the morning. he didn't even know he was a part. of it till right. now and that made me laugh. and everyone laughed but dude. he was sleeping upside down or no. he was upside down just doing this.

[ __ ] you know the planetary apes. thing and he said well i [ __ ] did this and that's shitty. and everyone just well not everyone. everyone seems to be. on his side. which is [ __ ] really nice when a comedian is going through. a really hard time. and a lot of comedians show. up and uh are there for somebody. to support them which is. great but i do support. him because the [ __ ] he's not racist and yeah he did that dumb [ __ ] and okay that's it and how hilarious is it that people are like saying spotify oh [ __ ] spotify good for free speech dude spotify doesn't give a [ __ ] it's about bags dude if [ __ ] joe rogan left by the way this is a [ __ ] hit this is a hit on joe rogan this has been out there people know it's been out there spotify knows it's been out there i saw that clip a long time ago everyone knows now it's coming into. the light because they're trying. to dig up everything. they possibly can on this. [ __ ] joe rogan because why because he's bigger than cnn fox news. [ __ ] discovery plus all together he's bigger than them all together and that's threatening so you know under the guise of doing what's right they get everybody thinking that they need to. take joe rogan off. the air why dude. why because he's a racist. guy no he's not a racist. guy and they know he's not a racist. guy also who's saying he's a racist. guy fox news who who's saying it. cnn who's saying it it's [ __ ] ridiculous. dude it's so crazy. this time and nothing's happening. by the way nothing's happening. he's gonna do his [ __ ] thing anyway how about that so you can pretend it's about free. speech you can pretend it's about doing. the right thing you can pretend it's about being racist. antiracist you can pretend it's about anything. but all it's really about is money. because that's all it's ever. really about and the people supporting him. the friends supporting him they're only doing it. because it's safe for them. because he's the king with the ring that. you kiss that's why. believe believe if it wasn't that. way if it was anybody else but rogan. if it was bert kreicher if it. was anybody else everyone would be wiping their [ __ ] hands clean of this. [ __ ] i promise you that and that's not taking anything away. from joe rogan because joe rogan. is a good guy. i know him and i know he's not racist. all i'm saying is that this. is about bags the support. is about racks and if it wasn't especially comedians because they're [ __ ] [ __ ] they would wipe their hands even knowing that joe regan joe rogan. isn't racist they'd be like well i don't contone that [ __ ] all these [ __ ] are seeing how it plays out oh how does it play out okay then okay then okay then okay good oh we're good okay then good then i support it that's what they're doing dude that's why i don't post [ __ ] because i know the [ __ ] and dude here's the other well i'm saying i support him now but why why doesn't the [ __ ] uh uh i don't know it's weird dude it's just weird when people go through these times like like uh dave chappelle went through his thing with the [ __ ] with his trans stuff and everyone was on his [ __ ] like dude some of the comedy clubs posted about how we support dave chappelle but not all of them dude not all of them they didn't all do it but they're happily there they'll happily put him on stage right but they won't post about it [ __ ] that [ __ ] it's all about and it's all about what you think the right thing to. do is to. make money you can act. like it's something else oh because i'm holier. than that and i do the right. thing y'all got [ __ ] demons in your [ __ ] [ __ ] too you got bones in your closet everyone did already did the thing that can bury them i've said this [ __ ] 200 episodes ago but the point is you can't [ __ ] you can't you just i don't know man remember the whole. thing about [ __ ] tommy hilfiger. and everyone thought that he was racist. because he they thought he said if i knew black people were gonna wear my clothing. i wouldn't [ __ ] have made it he didn't even [ __ ] do that that was like the narrative for so long people still think tommy hilfiger's racist. and he just didn't do that. people thought he did but he didn't you'll. see a [ __ ] some a black guy posting the thing at a time he'll figure thing and under the comments and be like oh really you're supporting that [ __ ] racist he's just not that guy i don't know tommy hilfiger but all i'm saying is joe rogan isn't racist and the whole. [ __ ] thing is ridiculous it's stupid as [ __ ] and it's awesome. because rogan just stays offline and lets. it [ __ ] happen because it's not real if you don't let it be um i just know how much of a [ __ ] mind [ __ ] it can be when the mob comes after you and you know i checked in with him about [ __ ] making sure he was okay and he's okay but it just [ __ ] sucks man it's not it's not it's not you don't understand what it's like and it sucks um this is so weird dude about did you know what's weird is about um rick ross here let's go cause we talked about him last time last time the piano that played his how lonely is he i mean look at this one [music] i'll burn your block down flamethrower what a what a loser camera guy just right now so hot just like oh god who's doing this oh hit the camera got backed up into. something that's amazing so [ __ ] so [ __ ] how he was doing it dude little spurts of flames so [ __ ] i love how he dude rick ross has so much furniture that he thinks he should have because that's what bosses have but he doesn't even like it that's the best part dude how could you be so lonely this is the thing that happens to. rappers once they get past. 40. rap is such a young man's. game that at this point. you're just like okay i guess. i gotta do something to. stay relevant like you can't be a [ __ ] rapper. and be 50. i mean you can kind of but like like eminem is. almost 50 and he's he can still. do it i mean the halftime. show was great dr. dre is a producer but like snoop does. it and everyone likes him. because it's funny you know. what i mean nobody's really buying. a [ __ ] is snoop even rapping anymore. does it does he's not coming. out with music right. if he was people would be like cool. but i guarantee that's not. the [ __ ] thing that people are yearning for on the snoop dogg. they want him to. do a [ __ ] show with martha stewart or some [ __ ] right because snoop dogg has just become a joke. of himself and that's fine. that's how he [ __ ] was able. to collect racks at this. point in his life but rappers get so lost. right that they have to. like they'll be like all right. i'll just get a flamethrower. and a piano that plays itself. and we'll start [ __ ] doing videos and hopefully worldstar will repost. me and this is how [ __ ] rick ross will sell tickets now. because he's not going to. be like yeah i'm in my maybach now and [ __ ] is sucking my dick. it's like you're 55 and that's just sad. grow up that's why ti. started doing [ __ ] standup right t.i sure he's made a lot of money and he's good for the rest of his life but he started doing standup. dude this is the thing that's [ __ ] hilarious. about standup too i know. about standup comedians comedians are. so [ __ ] backwards dude comedians will be like oh [ __ ] standup is the hardest [ __ ] don't take my jobs everyone thinks that they could do [ __ ] um stand up all these internet people are popping up and trying to. sell tickets but they're not why. are clubs letting them. do it you know just because this guy went [ __ ] viral. with a guitar the island boys. are gonna do stand. up right i'm gonna be pissed off. and then [ __ ] t.i will come out and be like i'm doing standup. comedy right now and he'll go do. like 50 minutes at the comedy. store and the comedy. store will post them. and be like hey [ __ ] uh troubleman came by. and blessed us with a and it's like dude. what are you [ __ ] doing you cocksuck you just want. you just dude like what what is. ha why are you acting like standup isn't actually a [ __ ] thing dude it's like yeah if the island boys. want to do it. or whoever you're all pissed off. because they're taking the spots. and then troubleman will come in. and just do 50. minutes at the laugh factory and then people other comedians will post. pictures of it and be like yo t.i has really been putting in work at this. standup [ __ ] it's like dude. god bless this [ __ ] for treating like a real. job dude what are you. talking about this guy [ __ ] made a song called rubber band man. he's not a comedian and he's just up. here just being all like hey what's up. man there's video of i've been doing standup. out there and it's [ __ ] terrible in no way can it can you be like oh whoa this is cool he's doing it you're you're sucking his dick because he's [ __ ] famous rapper dude how come i'm the only one who's keeping it real about this like it's so [ __ ] ridiculous i don't even want to. get heated i just want to.
