it's like it's it's a bit. special like it's not just the regular thing. it's a bit special right. if i say it's special then i sound like a [ __ ] cause it's just my podcast mm you know. i mean it would be special. i guess it would be reap. like really special would be like if you know i had i don't know somebody who was back. from the dead so like [ __ ] sinatra jfk sure all of that didn't want me. to do my sinatra thing but okay. sure no sinatra's good yeah so anyway what you know it was interesting. though when we started the podcast. though immediately i told one fire. to not start right away. and then he immediately started. right away right which is again. tonight so that's so that. sucks right yeah so you agree. he's one fire right i saw it. happen in real time in real. time yeah and he he basically proved. why that's his name. right yeah okay so we got some things. to talk about and mostly we like to. just come up and [ __ ] though you know cuz we just hang out in anyway and we like to. do that but i got a new tattoo so oh yeah. i'm a little cooler. you want to. talk about that a little bit i don't know. what do you think about it. i like it i like it. more than your first one. why slight this to. your first one yeah i just think it. looks cooler hmm i like that. how it goes all. the way around like that. yeah it doesn't look. cooler though it looks the same. cool did you know. that i don't think i did. know that yeah i don't because i don't think you. have to think something it'll to. have that opinion right. now it and i don't think that it's a ten. they're both tens on the on the on the tattoo scale i think the second one is a ten yeah the first one is different than a ten hmm you're saying like a 9 or an 8 just different than a 10 so definitely i mean stood deniro different ten. times nine or eight that's different. that time you know so anyway. dude i don't know you know you [ __ ] you've been into. tiedyed lately a lot. i'm weighing it tighter yeah wait let me also say. also you washed your hair recently yeah yeah yeah and you trimmed your beard. yeah now yeah you did. yeah cuz it used. to be really really straggly on the neck. here okay well now your sirness i'm not well i had an issue. with no i didn't have an issue. with it was real scraggly. on your neck a little bit you. like you had a problem no. it looks it looks a lot. better like this you look. really good thanks you look. more handsome so i'm a 10. now and it was before. it was something all different than attend. a different level pan. so i got i got like 3 tied. eye hoodies you gave me a tiedye hoodie. yeah i was hired. a hoodie in the car. just in case i want to. put it on yeah but i got a tiedyed tshirt. right now cool cool cool. that's too much too. much tight it's entirely. too much tied i so but that's very cool. i really like todd. i remember when i was in high school. when i was in high school. i was thinking about how i didn't want to. do tiedyed and i thought i would never wear tiedyed. and then and then i got older. and and this past year. i was like i guess. i gotta give up cuz it looks really. [ __ ] bitching and now i saw the life reps hoodies. and their tiedye oh yeah that's what's up. and that's that the whole thing. one time gj lee when i was. younger in high school digitally. was a guy in high school. and he said you become what you hate. he said that in high school. yep and it's so true. dude and i wasn't son. zu the high school years yeah. yeah yeah yeah yeah but yeah yeah yeah he said he said you become with you. hate night and i never ever [ __ ] don't think about that. so that's cool that when i was in high school. a [ __ ] jj lee from high school. from from from aakhirah california. said tell me that. you become a hate and we were in locking. out it and i still [ __ ] believe that sounds cool you know what that makes me think of though which i hate mmm is how kids will say [ __ ] like that just cuz they heard in adults. right i know he did of course. he did yeah yeah he didn't even. know what it meant yeah. he was right right. oh he got lucky right. but he was just parroting like some [ __ ] his dad or uncle or somebody in a movie set. i know i don't like that no. i don't like it either. but it now its effects if it affects my life. and i [ __ ] think utley i guarantee. that you did more than anything. to me when you said. jg lee i just think of jennifer jason. leigh he's that's why i mean oh yeah i was jennifer jennifer jason. leigh when i was in high school. said that today no he was he was you know. he was cool he knew. [ __ ] kung fu i think i don't know who jj lee is i think you might be making him up know i know everybody there was a really handsome guy dude remember when when we were younger when you were in high school i don't think i was even in high school yet you would come into. my room really really really late and do impressions yeah oh yeah dude. one on your basketball yeah. and i played basketball when i was in sophomore. year it was yeah you played left. ben i know that's such a stupid. [ __ ] dad job. so yeah no i did i did. all of them and i did all of them. very very badly no they. were good no they weren't. i mean she can i blow them. up like a nice sure. yeah it was robert. see strim derek yi oh. wow yeah turkey threw him i throw up. in my [ __ ] car once. and didn't give me a good. enough a couple of apology. and i'm [ __ ] still mad at him. for it that's movement to. most mcgillicuddy's dude it was so. [ __ ] annoying man we were in pasadena one of my best. friends mike stevens okay he was he was like we were derek. got so [ __ ] he drank like mind erasers or some [ __ ] first of all don't have a drink called mind eraser okay something yeah and derek yi dude he was first of all derek he was so he was so loud okay and he goes like this and he would go like this oh have you seen it like he was like right now like this is probably what he this is what he did all the time he'd be like have you seen the irishman and i'll be like no he said and then he said oh you haven't seen it oh it makes me so mad you don't answer the same question twice yeah okay we're not understand you asked me once i said no and i didn't see it in the amount of time the [ __ ] two seconds before you just asked me right so the answer is now he will be like dude do you did you see what happened yesterday at lunch no oh you didn't and i go no so that guy that guy [ __ ] that guy that's that guy okay first of all really tall chinese kid super tall for some reason i don't know how he got so tall being a chinese guy and he played basketball he was like the center and then he would also say john kemp oh he would always say shawn kemp is the most entertaining player in the nba. yeah and that pissed. me off because i believed it but when he said it. i got more mad that i felt the same. way that he did because he was the kind of guy. that's the same question. twice now we a year after high school. went to moose mcgillicuddy's or whatever. the [ __ ] it was it was a bar. in pasadena and well there. was her first mistake. i know i know i know i know i won. with mike stevens and derrick got so [ __ ] drunk. that they had to. be like yo man you have to. get out of the car. okay there he is wow. wow he would be like you got to. get out of the car. also he was like the kind of guy. i don't even know he had. like braces until he was like 35. i don't know how it happened. but he had it for like 20. years so wow that's him. yeah it's not too big. he wasn't [ __ ] tiedye in that pic it was he no but he would wear so [ __ ] he would wear like a [ __ ] shorts that were so big that were just basically painted dressed like kevin smith so so so he would say so he would so he got so drunk they throw my look on the bar and then we went back to. my car and i was like yo. mike he's gonna throw up in the back. of my car and derrick's like i'm not. going to throw up. in the back of your car. and i was like no you're gonna throw up. in the back of my car. and he was like i'm gonna be okay and mike. was like dude it's gonna be fine. trust me i've been drunk. a lot i had never been drink. yeah so i was like it looks like he's gonna throw up. in my back of my car. and he says he's not and derrick ii literally puts. his hands in like he's crawling into. the backseat of my car. and as he caught it. was like he went into. my car to. throw up it was legitimately. like he just went i am not going. to throw up john kemp. is the most entertaining player. in the nba and he goes tick. tick tick with his hands. tick tick black and just throws up. so much and then i couldn't get in touch. with him the next day. which [ __ ] made me [ __ ] rip roarin mad dude. because obviously get in touch. with me if you throw up. if you [ __ ] he'll act all over the backseat. of my [ __ ] on boy get in touch. with the next day dude. derek yack dude he did oh did i throw up. in your car yeah i did. but he didn't apologize. i didn't know it was i think it. was too embarrassed but was so annoying. he would tuck his shirts. in no matter what and i got so mad. oh dude he would wear oh my god i forgot. about this dude he would only wear [ __ ] tshirts with a pocket. and the pocket would have bugs. bunny coming out of it. with a basketball wow always or it would be like somebody dunking a basketball. in was dude the guy. loved that basketball man it's so [ __ ] funny how many asians loved [ __ ] basketball in la cañada dude well there were just a lot of asians yeah but they loved the basketball man it was insane they loved it wow john kemp i remember that from your impression yeah that's right i would come he said john can be the most entertaining player in the nba. yeah you keep me. up yep [ __ ] so late and actually i would hey dude these are the shirts. he would wear they're there. they're always like funny little design. look that he would have had that. that's the derogate that had it. wow that's so bad these are the least fashionable. clothing of all time that's bad. yeah wow anyway so um what what it. was about yeah blaire schober was another guy uh yeah who's the strongest man. alive he was he literally always he's 510. who's the strongest man. 11 was unbelievable but that was the kind of thing. you would do this. a lot when we were kids. you would [ __ ] you would do something that like before you would do it i would dread. it like i hated oh yeah. yeah yeah yeah while you were doing it. yeah yeah it was it. was actually funny so i i didn't want to. like not laugh yeah like it was like dreadful. experience i was like yeah i was laughing. yeah it's like how i watch documentaries. you didn't i don't want to. watch it and then when you turn it. on i'm like oh [ __ ] that guy's cancer. and i'm all in yeah i don't like to. watch documentaries oh yeah you don't likes. documentary yeah it's weird being a filmmaker. to which you are you don't. like watching documentaries which is. crazy cuz filmmakers love documentary. the thing about documentaries is. that i already agree. with you it it's so dependent on the subject. right that you can get lucky. make a shitty movie what is. besides the subject this shitty movie and it's a great. documentary because it's about a [ __ ] insane. thing hmm yeah right. it's not even necessarily good documentaries. just a good subject yeah. yeah and so i specifically i think because i'm i make movies and i think about them. that way i feel sort of i don't. know it's [ __ ] weird and the other way. around is true like you can make the best. documentary yeah but if the [ __ ] person it's about. or something right it. doesn't happen during the making of it. right right right [ __ ] watch it right like if i made a documentary about derek. ii and it was before. he threw up in my car. i will be unlucky but if i got the moment. he throw up in my car. and made it about how he said he [ __ ] wouldn't throw up in my car. and then did throw up in my car. there'll be a great. [ __ ] smash at documentary. i would watch like a staircase. version of that like an 8 hour. i would have to. put it in parts. like 7 at 7 episodes. of like it you yeah. just like yeah i didn't i wasn't gonna throw up. in the car and i knew i wasn't gonna. throw up in this car. and then the moment. changed once i got in his car. so boring and it's crazy. because john kemp. is still down there tending player. in the nba but we're not asking. about that this is not about. basketball at all oh i know i understand. but and you can't wear that shirt. because of licensing because it has the tasmanian devil. on the pocket i mean. how many do you have he had all. of them he any [ __ ] character. he had he definitely a tasmanian devil. one he had a [ __ ] daffy duck and then he had a [ __ ] for sure bugs but yeah like plenty of bugs bunny ones it was so like his mom that got him for him yeah that was like oh [ __ ] this is american you know because she was not from america right oh man was he trying to. never [ __ ] is that why. he worked yeah no it you or no. that you were trying. to do the basketball. 100% like a girl would come over. his house he'd be like you want to. go oneonone she'd be like well i was saying. well then we can get a little bit. more in intimate and be like oh i could just turn the lights. out and we can play what i want i bet. no one no guy who's ever. worn is sure like that has ever had sex. like the day he wore it. yeah you know i mean. like no one would have sex. with you if you're wearing that shirt. as the [ __ ] adult. as a bugs bunny thing. like coming out of the thing. yeah you're sure yeah pocket. maybe definitely only well if you're a black i definitely you have. but not if you're a white guy. no a [ __ ] way yeah a black guys can wear black guys can wear cartoon [ __ ] and it's kind of dope well what about what about asian guys. like derrick i don't know what kind of you'd have to. think about asian girls and be like oh but what are they into. they probably do like hard. it probably did right. yes i may be but not a white. guy dude forget it if you're a white guy. and you were a tasmanian devil. coming out of the pocket. and the [ __ ] tshirt there's no way you're getting your dick. wet yeah 0a0 money wait there's no [ __ ] way dude if your name is just like tom or some [ __ ] and you're like hey ladies how's it going. and you have [ __ ] legitimately daffy duck going. like this out of your [ __ ] pocket. get the [ __ ] out of here. you might as well literally have no dick. or elmer fudd dunking anyway dude. so yes so that's derrick ii and then there was blair. schober but you know the one. time do hood that you but then i came to. see you'd play baseball oh yeah. who was the guy that. hit the [ __ ] foul ball no that was steven you steven you of course derek. ii steven you okay cool. anyway we [ __ ] there was i was like the the older kid and i came to. see my brother play baseball and he hit a ball. steven you hit a ball. and it was coming right. at me because i was at the foul line. right like i was like off off. info territory out of my field. yeah that's it that's it. okay so so he he hit the ball. and i was like oh [ __ ] and my first thought was well [ __ ] i'm older than everybody here i can get hit by a base heartily because you know my brother and his friends are gonna be like oh is he [ __ ] steven you hit chris d'elia with the [ __ ] baseball you're gonna die. you're chunk now right. hey you're late you're less than but i got to. stay you know what i mean. yeah yeah yeah i gotta stay [ __ ] being cool. so yeah i was like i was like oh [ __ ] here it comes and i went i in my head are murdered they can just pick. away come in don't [ __ ] hesitate and i did i picked away but i picked the way that the ball was a hundred percent curving it. was slicing it was absolutely slicing. it was like a golf. ball i couldn't even believe. a baseball was slicing that much and it it just nicked me and i moved i had to. end up diving out of the way. but also your back bent. like yeah it was so just stayed there. yeah they wouldn't even think that's a. lot to you that's why. that was like the stupidest. [ __ ] most uncool [ __ ] and it was absolutely essa [ __ ] because i [ __ ] had to. bend my body out of the way. yeah we it it was like protoss a [ __ ] it was pre before we were it was it was it was i mean we were in high school. still you definitely were yeah. anyway yeah maybe before yeah yeah so that's it. i don't know but you know. i so steven you and derek. ii those guys [ __ ] vomited in my car. and hit me with a baseball. yeah it's a mocking. at a ship by the way. are your house your partner's going. it's going good yeah [ __ ] a lot. of good guests it's weird. i love podcasts yeah and i've listened to. them for a while but i never really knew how much people want to. listen to them. yeah it's [ __ ] crazy it's been the past. three years honestly. when i first started podcast. like 25 year old girls. didn't even know the podcast. was for real and now they're like now. they're like i listened to. your podcast i'm like oh you know. now that now not only do they know. what it is but they listen. up [ __ ] a bunch of podcast it's in c that's crazy. quickly they blew up and how much people want enough to. be listening to. them i know because people are [ __ ] bored. of [ __ ] and you're in your cubicle right. now listening high or you're driving. in the in the [ __ ] car hi. kevin spacey why do i know. yeah you're driving in your car. hi or you're in your cubicle hello. we said that last podcast. right that we always had a joke. about how kevin spacey walked in. the room and says hi. no matter yeah i don't know. i want to. know oh really thought you're the only without me. okay yeah so so here's the deal. though why do you ever do a podcast. and then you think why the [ __ ] this one isn't that good um yes i have you have okay yeah but they're all good and mine. that's what i feel every single time. well good that they're not. good y'all good i listened to. your last podcast yeah. actually when i was coming up. here and i hated it. you've lost your [ __ ] mind no that one was one. of the best episodes the beginning. like the first ten minutes. you you just lost your yeah. i can mind it that's those. are the best episodes. when i come in and i'm feeling. good and i know i feel like a tall. drink of water and [ __ ] like that and i'm gonna be like oh i'm in a good i'm gonna get like today i didn't get much [ __ ] sleep this morning. i think it much. so [ __ ] sleep so i feel like i'm not i'm a little bit off but it feels good because i'm talking about derek. ii and [ __ ] see that's the other thing dude i don't give a [ __ ] about i want it when i'm talkin i when i listen to. a podcast if i listen. to a podcast i listen. to somebody talk i want to. know really i wanna you know. okay here's the bet here's what it. is for real okay. if you're making a movie and the movie is all explaining and [ __ ] mmm i don't like it that's why john cassavetes is one of my favorite directors okay. exposition you don't want that. dude you don't know what the [ __ ] anyone's saying yeah you don't know what they mean. you don't know what they're referring. to yeah but it's their world. and the director captured it i agree. okay so in a podcast. i'm talking about derek ii i don't give a [ __ ] you never met. derek you yeah okay this. is what this is my world. i think it's funny that he's got the [ __ ] bugs bunny. [ __ ] coming out of the pocket. okay and i'm gonna talk about it. and if you don't give a [ __ ] then tune out. but here's the other thing. too when you're talking about. some [ __ ] that's very specific to. you and you [ __ ] are and it's all your world and i don't necessarily know about it that's the most interesting [ __ ] to. me yeah i agree i agree like the end. of vanilla sky oh my. god okay when the guys in the elevator and he's like here's what happened. on movie all right yo [ __ ] yourself dude ya don't have that scene. yeah the whole movie. was riproaring awesome it. was [ __ ] rip roarin aw. so my god and then and then and then the elevator he's like this. is what happened i'm out. dude yeah i'm out i don't want. anything l me what's going. on do what you're doing. and i'll be that's like you got to. treat me like a [ __ ] hot chick man treat me like a hot chick dude if you want to. have sex with a chick. then you just got to. pretend like you don't give a [ __ ] about her if you're like a ho. ho but sweetheart this is what i'm like this. is what i'm like sweetheart. ahahaha this is what i'm like right. then the girls like um check please. right and you're not even at a restaurant. my baby you know. what's weird i think that that is done. because people are constantly like are they gonna get it. are they gonna get yeah and it i feel like everyone says like this. is just true i feel like people don't want. the explanation seen but it's done. for people who are expected to. want the explanation [ __ ] yeah yeah i mean i don't even want to. know what happened like before. the movie started bro. remember what i told you about jj. lee said that [ __ ] becoming a hate and that's something that i've resonated. me originated with me yes dude. i was watching men in black. and another thing resin resonated. with me that tommy lee jones. said and i never don't think about it. so wait hold on. just before jj lee and tommy lee. jones but tom you have to. have ali in your name. okay but tommy lee jeung something that tommy lee jones. says the will smith on a black. man in black stuck with you. yes okay you're 12. well that was 12 i [ __ ] saw it oh i thought you might you saw her. recently knowing it's stuck. with you for this many years. 100% you got problems but what is it. this is what he said he said. will will smith is like i don't. know man people are smart. and he said and tommy lee jones. says no a person is smart. people are stupid and that's kind of what it. is and when that happened. i turned into. the [ __ ] weebey mean i went oh he's from the wire. but that's what i [ __ ] thought off yeah i mean and i was like oh that's true. and so people don't a person doesn't want the explanation. but people want the explanation but when i'm in a room. with people and we get the explanation. i go like this ah for [ __ ] sake but everyone else is did. we beam him oh he's from the wire. wow yeah right. right right yeah i don't want the explanation. i don't want the explanation. at all but that is actually. pretty wise thing that tommy lee. jones said in men in black. i know it was probably written. but that would be crazy if it was an ad. it's not a documentary if it was an ad. lib and you ad. libbed people are tomorrow a person. is smart when people are stupid. and then the director was the wee baby. who was that oh we got to. live it in did you see. the new men in black. with [ __ ] the tube people no i tell you what though. i saw the poster made me real. mad oh got it well. why i don't know well. i don't know dude it just was like sometimes. i'll see a poster or see. a trailer or hear. about a movie and it's just for some reason. it's like it's like the movie it. feels like the movie version of like a [ __ ] happy meal. like it's not a real. movie oh very interesting it's not a real. movie mmm it's just like some [ __ ] put together for you to. like yes yeah yeah like here's the toy. in it yeah exactly. not into it man. neal brennan and i would always text. each other fake movies that were coming. out even though they were real movies coming out. like there's one called like drunk. parents with like alec

and they're leaving. her to college and he's wearing the coat. okay so work on every [ __ ] ring the coat and she's always dressed for a funeral for some reason. okay so and the college. kid the interesting about the college. kid is she's 30. for it so that's all good. yeah so let's do this. that was by the way. no humor or anything. really in that just just exposition in a trailer. which is crazy without that. terrible music you would actually have no idea. what's supposed to. be a comedy okay. i'm just doing my job. i just need a little more. time bar you find a way. to put some newton lassoo sell some crap. finally a break okay so he's car. gets towed why i don't know. he says i need a little bit more. time right we don't know. what that means for the car. we don't know what that. means for the movie at all yeah. and you definitely don't know. what it means in relation. to college or a daughter leaving. a hundred percent okay. so so okay so here we go. okay now he's talking on a phone. let's just go with an axe. accountant i was mastercard yep. he was talking in and in the phone. an act with an accent. yeah and his wife was watching him. and she's still dressed for a funeral. and how much did the dry. the way he still has the jacket how much did the director beg him. not to do the accent. and he said okay and then did it. like that every single time. yeah yeah oh i won't do it. you want me to. do it as a matter. of fact the director at the end. he didn't [ __ ] nine takes and directors like yeah and he was like he was like did we get it and then the director is like sure because you know he's like okay he's not gonna do it i told not to. do the accent and the eyeball. says oh wait well let's do one. more because you said you wanted. one without the accent. and there was a yeah and they said in action and he still did. accent yeah okay so i walked directly to. his trailer yeah yeah yeah yeah okay so and then what does. he say here mr. kerr that

out. nigel's house yes so far as has nothing to. do with drinking yes parenting. drunk parents no no or parenting. yeah the kid there. was away at college still the movie. should be called nigel's

called i know i know that okay. and banette banana duct tape. to all sells for a hundred and twenty thousand. dollars my first question because i actually don't know. the answer mmmhmm it's not like mounted. you know what do you get what. do you take home the artist. comes and puts it on your wall. and you exchange the banana. as as you feel needed like. you should replace the bunny. you replace it and when it when it gets brown. you you can replace. it as much as you want i mean. or the artist comes along. and replaces it which either way. is is it's either way. is stupid okay huh. why didn't that guy who wanted. it right just do it. i can make my own yes. yeah because he's [ __ ] it because he's a cuda yeah that's the most cuda [ __ ] yeah so abhorrent artists on saturday.

called. banana duct tape against wall that's the worst. part it's called the comedian. yeah good to know. wow the art which is what artists. eddie you know the art was not. compromised anyway by the guy eating it well okay well he was just getting so [ __ ] nervous that he was gonna get 120 grand right right. right oh oh you did. it actually doesn't compromise. the art so you can still own. the

[ __ ] 82 calamari's on one for one fell off in the sauce. and he [ __ ] ate the a1 and dipped halfway in the sauce. and then he [ __ ] scooped out. the other one all the way. in the sauce and then ate the [ __ ] up the one and he didn't care which one he liked better. absolutely asinine well you have a problem. with the fact that he even grabbed. two in the first place. well you can grab two as long. as you know what the [ __ ] kind of sauce. are getting involved with the two. how could you know. because you control the dipping.
