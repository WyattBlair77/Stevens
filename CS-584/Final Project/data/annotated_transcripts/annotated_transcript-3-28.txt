[music] who banging on the [ __ ] dude i mean too it was just [ __ ] out dude throwing up. gang signs holy [ __ ] did you see the pig. put it up right. here i mean that [ __ ] looks different dude. i mean his hands were doing some unorthodox. [ __ ] dude i mean he got smacked and he was in a [ __ ] football stadium but right then he woke up and he thought he was [music] wipe the dust off them [ __ ] adidas holy [ __ ] man i'm that's [ __ ] up but though you see those gforce dudes those when you pass. out and you wake up and you just you think those gforces you know you you think you're you're just all of a sudden someone fought you out of vaughn's. parking lot and you're just like oh [ __ ] no i'm just never mind. my bad okay i'm just trying to. see how many forces i can go and i got to. g5 and then i passed out and i'm just practicing for my for my flight school. yeah dude you know you [ __ ] got knocked the [ __ ] out when you wake up. and [music] um your hands your hands. do crazy [ __ ] when you get knocked off so he had two out he got knocked out he got two concussions and they fired the [ __ ] doctor that told him it was okay to. play and that's cancel culture. dude they treat everything like cancel culture. it's insane the doctors the doctor the doctor knows. the doctor sometimes makes mistakes by the way. the dot guess who would have got fired. if he didn't clear two of the play. doctor it's all about money. and somebody needed to. take the hit dude. and the doctor was like okay i'll clear. it because i get it. this is football and you need to. make your bags and then when tua. got hit the second time. [music] the doc goes like this. oh no when tua. woke up and just [ __ ] the transformers. when two woke up and was just banging on. a transformer as the doctor goes like this. i'll pack up i'll pack up. dude when the doctor [ __ ] saw those the [ __ ] west side the doctor goes miles done he's like i'm out byebye i get it i'll be the one i'll take the hit cause somebody's got to. take the hit because cancer. culture hey how about just look look let me just say this all right and it seems it seems totally elementary all right but football is football when football looks in the mirror it sees football it's not something else okay you take a picture of football and then show football that picture football goes like this that's me all right so if you're trying to. turn football into. something else i.e something where guys aren't going. to be getting concussed. then it's not football you. take a picture of that football. and show the picture to football. and football goes like this. who's that because it's not him. so if you're gonna be doing football left. football be football dude. okay the sec this. is the thing people are gonna get concussed. but they're grownups they can. do what they want now. is it going to. be sad when they grow. up and [ __ ] and they get to. be [ __ ] 60 years old and they want to. put a bullet in their own. heart so that you can study. their br like whatever junior say i did hey. study cte and blast it. away at his own heart. yeah that's true that's troubling and it's sad. but we all know we all know. so football is football so if it's gonna be football then that's what's up. dude if not get rid of football. stop with the hole if we do this. if we have these rules. if a guy can't play and then this and this we need to. look out for the safety. it's football you might as well. be baking a cake if you're not going to. let guys play because of because they're gonna fall on the ground. and [music] who banging on. the transform you know what i'm saying it's football. and then you're gonna be mad when they fall. on the ground and they start. asking who banging on the transformers. you just took a picture of football. developed it said that the football and said who's that and football goes like this it's me foreign concussed that's what they should do dude the miami dolphins should just come out and be like you know what here's what we're doing now they come out in aprons and [ __ ] with like [ __ ] you know dough rollers and just something and other [ __ ] in it with ingredients and [ __ ] and there's already tables out there in the 50yard line and they just go like this hike and then start making a [ __ ] cake and some muffins and then other people at the fans like what are they doing and they go sorry the culture came for us and now we're not football anymore. you're firing doctors out there you would have been fired. no matter what if he didn't play. the game the way the [ __ ] miami dolphins wanted him. to play they would have got fired. that way they would have put another doctor and he would have couldn't play. he would have got fired don't you understand. how this [ __ ] goes football you're football. and that's the most crystalline [ __ ]. ever but it's true. he speaks the truth of jesus. christ uh uh he speaks the truth. but it's the truth it's just like it's like enough. is enough dude oh but this is what the doctor should have. done oh really a guy that [ __ ] you know what i mean works. as a realtor sometimes oh really some [ __ ] chick. you know what i mean. in uh that sometimes goes. to armstrong gardens and raises some kids oh really it's just so [ __ ] it's so ridiculous dude stop stop it you know what i mean that's the thing you make you if you have the game and all of a sudden you're like whoops we need helmets then put the helmets on and go to. work okay or or just stop the game right. but this whole well we gotta no. stop bending you already bent. enough your football that's the game. dude it's like it's a [ __ ] war but yeah but okay but take the guns. away and use slingshots no you gotta [ __ ] push people's wigs. back dude that's the whole [ __ ] thing you run out. there the the weapons. get better and better you got flame. you got [ __ ] all the shits. you got bombs use them. all that's war imagine people. it's pretty soon cancer culture. is going to start.

[ __ ] you know dahmer i get it because there's like there's like there's there's like the biggest ones they'll always be made and then like maybe one that you've never heard of but netflix. will even make the ones. in the middle that we already know. all this [ __ ] about but then they'll just like they'll make it like it's some big dahmer [ __ ] and it's not even a dahmer [ __ ] you know it's just kind of sad man i was hearing. what lil boosie was saying. about how like dude. it's so [ __ ] up for the families. and [ __ ] about the the the the um it's so [ __ ] up for the families of the of the people who were slain they say that to. make it sound normal more noble. which is you know i guess. good because they were slain but uh and it's so [ __ ] up for these like imagine you you you're like husband or wife was killed by some serial killer and then and then they make a documentary and a [ __ ] you know a crazy uh uh series about it that's like you know all for the dollar and you just gotta sit there and watch as people are like oh i'll buy the guy's prison glasses for 150 000 because serial killers are sexy you got [ __ ] thoughts on tick tock. just like these are the these are the serial. killers i would [ __ ] in order. and it's like yeah but they [ __ ] kill people are so sad. it's kind of [ __ ] up there's nothing to. do about it but i mean. like i feel like lil boosie's. right they should be paid. these families should be paid. to bring up all their trauma. and [ __ ] but i don't know man. like at least with the forensic files. like they pay the people to. come on the show it's like they'll. make 350 for talking about. it and that was when i realized you know. the ice cubes had castor oil gt in it. and that was when she realized the ice cubes. had castrol gt formula in. it um but yeah we watched. that anthrax one which was i didn't. know am i racist i thought. it was the [ __ ] people from uh afghanistan or saudi arabia whatever. the [ __ ] it was i'm i'm dude. i had no idea that it was. just some kooky white guy. that was just literally anthrax. and everyone tried to. get involved the one on. netflix is good it's got. that dude from the um that. one marvel show that everyone i guess. watches i don't know what it. is but he's a good actor um the guy. who obviously was uh it. was between him and the guy who actually got better. call saul but then that guy. got it um anyway he plays the guy and it was just some guy. who was like leading investigators down. a wrong path and then it. was really him mailing. out all the anthrax to.

[ __ ] dude don't smile at me. because i just think you want something. from me in japan. there's a concept called shokunin which refers to. an artisan who is deeply dedicated. to their craft always striving for perfection. in what they make that's japan. if i want that i'll move to. tokyo dude give me some. halfassed american [ __ ] dude i want. my cars breaking the [ __ ] down and people pissed off that they're sitting behind glass quiet quitting is the opposite of shokunin setting boundaries and simply completing the tasks you're opposed to. complete within the time that you're paid. to do them.
