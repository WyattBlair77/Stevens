grandma the other day and then i realized halfway through it was like oh this is actually not what happened and then i kept going i just forced my way through it and it was all pretty much just completely wrong and it's all good life rips while you're doing that while you're making mistakes and it continues to. rip uh speaking of which we got our new merch. out there for the holiday it's not

because i said so and we're just trying. to build this cult. dude you know the uh the tattoo somebody just sent me. that they got life rips. on the inside of their. fingers jeez man. that must hurt i but they fade a lot. right whatever uh on the fingers. and all that and whatnot. um for me i shouldn't. get it on my trigger. finger because of how i make the gun. talk you know what i'm saying. because when i get pissed. off right we don't want me. to reach in the back. we don't want me. to reach behind my seat. and pull out something that's four. pounds right because it gets itchy. right when you start talking a mess. with me it gets itchy. and i said mess not the swear. word because they say in the first. however many minutes of a youtube. video if you swear then it tracks. it and you know it. you get shadow bend a little bit. what's with the 596 subscribers that we have on super cult. studios what's with it dude. something's going on our subscribers we were killing. it was doubling it it was doubling it. i came back to. youtube and we were doubling it. until it killed me that's what tupac. said not like someone's gonna but what's the deal. dude we changed it. to super cult immediately stopped no. extra subscribers in the next seven it's a conspiracy. so what is it what is it. talk amongst yourself in the comments hypo activate. that algorithm because it's like what is going. what is going on my it's just absolutely. mental we stole the 596 when we came back we had like 516 mate we had like bloody like what what was it like 80 000 the line like whatever like a month and then it stole this soon as we got there and changed the name camp what is it the two things that change or we changed the name and we added lifeline uh this is not lifeline is a rip roaring show dude but i digress so check if you're even subscribed subscribe again get your friends to. subscribe what's youtube doing baby. um it's a conspiracy. and you know what i've been a part. of conspiracies before so it's fine. i can deal with it and i can roll with the punches. um but we have a good time. here hey dude round of applause. for me also major uh bonehead move uh. i don't go to. the bank too often because a lot of this. stuff gets wired right because you know paper gets heavy. but uh we um i went to. the bank and i put it in my google. my google uh directions or whatever. it's called and guess what happened. dude a wells fargo came up and i go great. on santa monica boulevard. that's where i go all. good i know the dudes there. i know the homies. and i know that speaking. of money i just made sixty dollars. on shopify but um yeah dude and it's like so i i plug it. in and i'm going down to. go to santa monica. the the the the the street and i'm like it. says take left and i'm like that's but that's not where it is. i go i'm like all right. let's just see what they do. i take sometimes they say like well as far they pretend. like if you do it in the google. thing maps it'll go. in and then it's just like a a [ __ ] uh what do you call it. um first swear word five thirty. minutes in um it's a uh uh [ __ ] what do you call atm and you're like oh for fucksake. you ever do that you put it in the bank. and you're like oh bank of america. and you go and it's just an atm. and you're like i wanted to. go in so dude they should specify on the google. but again i digress. and so um so i get there and it's a whole full bank. dude and it was closer. than the one that i've been going. to for years so oh dude. what a big bonehead move. and i'm pissed but it's okay. because we're stacking yape right. so i go in and the [ __ ] bank the new bank that i'm gonna go to. this is not my home bank. dude oh it's much closer. than the last one. and yeah like the guy who deals. with my [ __ ] he emails me from time. to time you know he's like you want. to go over some more. interest rates or whatever. they say i don't listen. to the email but i i always reply. back like yeah whatever my business. manager says buddy good seeing you the other day but they got a whole bank that i didn't know about a whole bank that i didn't know about and so i go in and when i go in what's it smell like it smells like eggs and pipes dude it smells like [ __ ] eggs and pipes dude and you know what i'm talking about too that's the greatest thing smells like eggs

check it. out um but uh yeah so uh uh so yeah i do but my mood. is very chill. but let's get off the cbd talk. but my i'm too uh in my life. i have been in the past. two back and forth with my emotions. like something smells bad i'm pissed. off i walk outside. it's a beautiful day and then i drop that. and then i'm feeling good. all of a sudden i gotta let's i gotta be more zen. you know i gotta just start. like i heard a podcast. the other day and they were like saying something. about how we have to. remove want if you want. to be like jesus. jesus or jesus depending on. how much of a [ __ ] [ __ ] some ass real ass will say jesus um but you have to. uh remove want from your vocabulary. and your just you remove. want from your life and i was like man. that's like if you didn't want [ __ ] how much easier your life. would be like i i see shoes. sometimes like i want those. but then when i just sit back. and i'm like if i wanted to. remove a want from my. life there you go. i already want to. remove want from my life. so i'm [ __ ] i'm thinking of it wrong if i didn't want let's just say that. if i didn't want right. then how easy would life. begin the the it's just tremendous but then you have. a kid and you want their life. to be good and that's a want. so it's like that's really falls on its ass. and religion is [ __ ] all good but don't be mad at me. if you think you know it's like i'm not outwardly. outspoken against this [ __ ] but it's just like religion is just like you know what i mean it's just like between religion you know they they how they house a bunch of traditions. and traditions or the start. of everything horrible you know. what i say on my podcast. like tradition am i on my in my cult. we have no traditions because traditions. is what causes war. tradition is what causes anger. traditions will make your dad. flip up the [ __ ] plate. on thanksgiving because it's not. going right and then he's pissed. and goes in his room. and they gotta talk if there were no. traditions we would all. live in harmony i'm telling you the truth. dude everyone's [ __ ] crazy religion. isn't saying you know what religion. does it makes people [ __ ] rich but then also it makes people crazy. right so the guy from hobby. lobby is not re not leaving. his estate to. his children dude. he is not leaving his estate. to his children. he's just giving it. away dude and if i was this kid. i'd be like oh come on dad. like at least bill gates is leaving. like a small amount to. his kids which dude. those people are [ __ ] crazy dude man if i stack hundreds of millions of dollars. if i got if i got that. hobby lobby money guess. who's getting all of that yaper. dude calvin guess who's getting. all of that yaper when. i croak all of the people. closest to me dude. nobody else is getting a red scent. even if i start believing. dude i could if i could start believing. in all of the gods. nobody getting a red scent. but my bloodline dude. nobody's getting a red nobody's getting a crimson scent. dude i swear to. god well what about nope. what about the tide nope. nobody's getting a red scent. unless they got that delia name after it. and they're younger than me. or if i die prematurely older. than me i swear to. god i'm gonna leave one cent to. all my enemies oh that's [ __ ] cool. dude i'm gonna leave one cent to. all my enemies i gotta write. my will i really do it's been on the back. of my mind i gotta leave. it to i gotta i don't wanna. die like philip seymour hoffman and he [ __ ] you know. his [ __ ] was a mess his his estate was a mess because he didn't have a will ah let's not get too dark. huh but yeah but hobby lobby. guy what's up man people get so big. and so [ __ ] like look at kanye. dude caa dropped him because he's calling a war on a war for all the jews or whatever dude. and then he's like well i'm jewish. that doesn't work um well i could say i don't like jews. because i'm jewish doesn't work. on hey kanye you. didn't trick us hey kanye. we could see he's not jewish. how many times in your life. have you ever said oi. um dude his piers morgan. interview was absolutely fantastic but also just kind of like sad. i watched 50 minutes of it. what the [ __ ] am i doing. with my life that i watched piers. morgan and kanye west talk. for [ __ ] 50 minutes while i was on a plane. but still dude because we did. um raleigh and then uh what do you call. it raleigh and then um uh i was in savannah. georgia oh i should talk about savannah. in a little bit um but yeah dude. my i'm just under like remember when charlie sheen was. like talking about the tiger blood [ __ ] i was with him. you know tiger blood i have tiger blood i was with him. but when kanye now kanye. is just above the part. where i just i can't. anymore i can't anymore. i i like he's just talking about. like like the things i love what. kanye does is when he gets interrupted by. pierce morgan he goes now you interrupted me. right and i'm just like dude. you're speaking my language man. that's basically just singing. oops okay so kanye. got that from me. all good kanye stole from me. it's fine okay. but

dude he was just sniffing. and i know you're probably like well maybe he had a tick. but he didn't do it. he didn't and i'm not a doctor but i know. it wasn't a tick. because the guy was so regular and he just kept checking espn and watching a [ __ ] movie with sean hadassy so i was like dude. he doesn't have a tick i don't know. what the movie was do i couldn't figure it out. but i look at people's phones. when i'm next to. them i know you could probably tell that. by now but um so i write and so then i i let it go. and then i write now it's like 12. times a minute i'm dude. i'm going crazy i'm afraid i'll snap at him. i wrote him i wrote the text. chain that because i didn't want to. snap at him right. and then somebody said hannah. i'm a a little tissue and i said yeah. like [ __ ] blow it and i said i noticed about two. hours ago i said not. sure if it was the whole flight. but it had to. have gotten worse um and then i wrote oh. my and then i wrote i'm gonna text. one every time he does. it so you know okay. and i write one one my buddy. writes i'm dying i write one. my buddy writes haha nice jesus. i write one one he says it's too. long a flight to. not ask him i write. one one he says is this. first class i say yeah. even though i shouldn't ask that. because he knows then i wrote one. he said yeah you got to. say something and and then and then [ __ ] my friend my average friend is like oh you're still flying this. late i said mark yeah. you know this isn't about that. like stick with the program. also like what what i'm what are you i'm saying. one i'm next to. the guys like what does he think so again. i write one because he snipped again. and he says we're and then i just said we're landing. one one and he says just slap him. as you land and i write. and i write one and he says you should make a noise. every time he does it now. that is a great gangster. move dude if he just and i go. oh oh oh like that's gangster but it was. too late and we were landing. um one and i could you imagine sitting next. to this one he says earful my friend. says earphones maybe i said i have. them dude he was breaking. through this here's the other thing. too i lost my i lost. my i bring two airpods. airpods are [ __ ] hey. fall out of my pocket. more make them rounder you know first of all make them. so they don't fall out. of your pockets they want you. to they want you to. say i told you i've been ahead. of i've been in conspiracy. before this is apple the apple. products this is they want. you to follow they want. to follow your pockets. because so that's why they make them. all sleek and [ __ ] and round so you get to. buy new ones and guess what i do. to beat apple at their own. game when my [ __ ] head when my airpods fall out. of my pocket i don't even. try to look for him. i lost them i try. a little bit i go. where is it i duck. in the airplane i go. under the seat of the airplane. guess what dude they're gone. they're gone i don't let apple. get the best of me. they don't make me that. angry plus i'm using all my anger. for the sniffer right so i i just go. into my backpack i take out. other airpods and i you. know what that is game tax. when you lose your apple. products that's game tax when the [ __ ] airpods. fall out game tax dude and of course i want. i i wear the [ __ ] slide the side pockets so it's easier to. fall out but that's fashion. dude i don't want to. i don't want the pockets. on the like the jean. pockets are you guys. with me on this. you know what i mean. if you're listening let me know in the comments. but anyway so i took out my other ones. and i didn't have the noise. canceling on these so. i'm like i have the earphones and i still heard. the [ __ ] so i write one okay [ __ ] man one i'm
