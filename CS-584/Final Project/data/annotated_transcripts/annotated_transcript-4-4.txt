[ __ ] npr man this is where we come we hang out if it was the [ __ ] in 1999 people would say we chillax but i never said that i say we relax and we chill we we we respect both of those words we don't say [ __ ] i'm not a guy who does you know takes the two words and put them together like fantabulous that's such a like a like a a a portly white woman thing to. do oh it's fantabulous you know. what i mean like a pearshaped white woman loves. combining words but your boy. gives the words talking about. the guy who [ __ ] abbreviates the most words on the planet. but anyway dude i respect the words. i need to respect. is what i'm trying to. say so i got to. [ __ ] so we were in san diego and it was beautiful. man we got some coffee. people wanted to. take pictures i saw a bunch of people dressed in a banana and banana outfits. don't even i don't even understand. but dude the homeless problem in la. if you think the homeless problem well the homeless problem in downtown is probably way worse. but dude in san diego. it's [ __ ] forget it dude. so many homeless people it's sad. as [ __ ] it's sad. [ __ ] man they gotta figure that out just kind of for everyone for the homeless people but also for the not homeless people there was a homeless guy i was trying to. get pizza and he was just like dude. i don't even know like he was just he came. up to me and he was like hey what's up. i thought he was a crazy. homeless dude and he was he was like what you need man. my family owns this. place and i'm like oh [ __ ] wow no it's okay man don't worry about it he's like what'd you need a family owns. this place and i pulled. i i had to like be like yo man. it's okay i hear you. you got to back. up though a little bit and i kind of like gently touched. his you know his chest. and just kind of you got to. got to back up. a little bit he's like what. you need you need to. water some and i'm like i i don't. know man we're all good. let me just order the pizza. and i ordered the pizza. and then he was like all right. chris you take care i was like oh he's got a home. he knows who i am am. i so famous that [ __ ] homeless people know who i am. i don't i don't think i am i'm genuinely. asking because that's like elite level fame if you got dudes. with like frayed jeans. on walking around with dirty. feet and they're like hey it's you then you made it dude. right so i didn't really understand. what i mean maybe his family. did own it he also had a really. weird expensive [ __ ] hoodie on can't remember what it was but maybe he was just a crazy owner oh no show. me love up in the club um so yeah uh san diego. was was was nice as [ __ ] stayed at the [ __ ] andaz. had a good stay got four. rooms probably won't get him reimbursed from that. from the [ __ ] laugh factory owner. all good but um yeah uh i drew i drove. the car today i was gonna go. meet my son um and kristen at the park. and [ __ ] took the [ __ ] new car out right the new car out. wanted to get the luxurious. boss mobile just out for the day. to go meet my son. and all of a sudden ding. ding now remember when i got the lemon. i already have the car that's the lemon. i got a lemon i fixed. it the car's not a lemon. anymore okay we took it in for like two weeks they redid. the whole shits and uh so now that car. works i got the other you know.

what are you gonna. say now and then the guy's like like [ __ ] colin firth in just stutterville right. whatever that movie is called stutterville. king speech and um so i basically he's like sure. i'll do it and he does. it and my car is parked in like a situation. where it's like kind of blocking the place. to get into the to. the uh whatever the garage right. so this other porsche. cayenne pulls up and it's like kind of a it's a porsche. cayenne but also like fix. it like it's got [ __ ] all [ __ ] up with it the tires. are so bald and this dude. pulls up and he said and and he and the and the guy who's working. there says oh can you just pull in and my car. is a little bit kind of in the way. and i feel bad about it. so the guy goes to. move past my car. into the garage in the cayenne and he says uh he's like this. you know young black dude. and he says uh and and he's like um and he says to. me uh because i'm looking make sure he's good and also i don't want him to. hit my car and he's like i can see man. i can see i can see man. don't trip and i was like oh yeah. that's what i said i could see man. don't trip and he pulled. in and i was like what a [ __ ] [ __ ] you know and then i went into. this just and by the way it. was so like i knew i was like when he parked i knew. when he got out i was like i bet. he has [ __ ] slides on got out. sure enough had slides on i knew it. dude i'm [ __ ] that doesn't mean anything. but i'm [ __ ] sherlock holmes. when it doesn't matter and um and so like sherlock. holmes is figuring out murders. but i'm like i bet this. guy's got [ __ ] slides on and i know that and then so maybe i'm like sherlock. holmes's assistant but anyway um so he gets out and and while the guy was jacking. up my tire do you guys ever do this. like i was like just in a vivid. daydream imagining like if this guy said something else or like if he tripped or like i was imagining like if he tripped or if he asked hey where's the bathroom and then the guy points to. it and it says bathroom. above the door for me. to i wanted so badly something. like that to happen. so i could be like oh [ __ ] man sorry i thought you could see it. oh i'm sorry man i thought you might see it. don't trip and that didn't happen. but in my head and my my heart. i was getting so angry. about it and i'm like if this [ __ ] happens dude i'm um i'm ready and then while i was deep in that vivid imagination. and that daydream the guy just goes it's 25. dollars to pat your car. and i was about to. retire and i was like. oh okay and then and then my assistant was like here's the here's the thing. for the wheel to. undo the wheel and then let's get the tire. p uh how many tire. p pieces it we needs. it's on the inside of the door. and the guy's like well she knows a lot. about cars i was like yeah. bro that's like fast and furious. man she's like michelle rodriguez. anyway man it all worked out. okay my tires patched and you know. i survived a neardeath experience. because of the nail and also because the guy almost [ __ ] you know he almost got into. it with me i see. it man don't trip. okay cool sounds good bro. speaking of not tripping this is unreal. i don't like rick ross. it's like i think rick ross. is at the level where it's like you. made a lot of music. and like he was the [ __ ] hot [ __ ] and now he he obviously makes a lot of money and it makes a lot of music but he's not like the hot [ __ ] anymore. like this is the most [ __ ] this is an instagram video. he put on this is here this. let's just play that music. back there i told myself. rosie when you get in the position. i want somebody to. be at my house at certain times. just to play the harp. okay just to play. the piano okay and at this. particular time i had the money. to pay nobody to. come do that for me. which i really meant and told myself i meant. so what i did was because i was getting some money. i went and bought the piano. that played itself and then he shows. a piano that plays itself. i mean uh sir lonely also show. the cam show the piano. closer so far away i bought the piano. that played itself like this. guy are you [ __ ] 11 like that's not even like those have they've been around since [ __ ] bar fights and saloons like that's not that impressive. every piano has a play itself. mode i bought the piano. that plays itself also brag. about the brag when it. happens when i was younger. i said i wanted to. have somebody play the piano. for me and at this. particular moment dude rappers are always saying. moments like particular moment. like just say moment. you know this particular moment. me personally my particular moment. what had happened was always adding extra words just say. what happened what had happened. in this particular moment. for me personally it's like how many [ __ ] words are you gonna use guy when i was younger i wanted to. make i wanted to. have a god play the piano. or the harp for me. you know me i don't even. like harp or the piano. but i convinced myself that i like it. because it was a way. to flex my money if i ever. got it and then i did and then i realized that hiring somebody is not economical and it's also kind of annoying. because they always around also i'm [ __ ] a diva and i don't want anybody that's going. to be around i got to. tell us what to. do because they might [ __ ] up and then i get blood red mad so instead of that i got the piano that plays itself. you know what i mean. when i was younger. i had this vision in my mind. that boss of a boss. in a cartoon like duck tales i wanted. to jump in a pool. of money coins but then i realized a little bit. after that that you know. what i mean jumping into. a pile of coins. you would absolutely break. your [ __ ] neck whether you're a duck or not so i thought about hiring. a guy to. play the harp even though. i don't like harp music. and i thought about playing hiring. a guy to. play the piano even though. i don't like piano music. you know i do hip hop i rap. about hoes and money. and rims i'm killing. people so instead of hiring a guy because he would be so annoying. to being at my house. and also i do crazy. deviant [ __ ] and yell at the maids. i will get the i and i like and basically i'm too. lonely to have anybody about the piano. that played itself [laughter]. there it is all the way. all across the echoey dining. room with no furniture in it. because i ain't got kids. cause i'm lonely shout out. to all the pair eh. dude it's so funny. to [ __ ] imagine these guys sleeping like actually just being in their beds you know and waking up a little bit at 6 30 and being like i bet i could get another obligation and then and then falls back to. sleep at seven and then wakes up. at [ __ ] 9 30. [laughter]. time to wake up. and press the button on the piano. to make the piano. play itself so lonely also so annoying you know. so echoey dude also rick ross. are you fat or not you're one. of those guys that it's like just gain weight. or [ __ ] chop it off at this. point and then dude it's on. hot freestyle the [ __ ] instagram handle. is hot freestyle and dude. it says rick ross flex. is different dude that's how did that. become so passe so quick the i'm different.

[ __ ] awesome cool have him do the show and they're like cool i'll get up i'll get a time for you and they told me my time of the show. and then they were asking him. when he wanted to. go and then he he was like i don't know and so he's like never mind i'm not doing the show. and it's like and then they call me. and they're like he's not doing the show. and i'm like i don't give a [ __ ] if he does the show. or not put it put him on the show. put the people on the show. what the [ __ ] do i care and i realize that they're just asking me because they were wondering if i have an ego. about it and i'm like bro. i don't give a [ __ ] dude. like put anybody on the show. it doesn't matter you know. unless they're gonna [ __ ] literally [ __ ] shoot me or backstab. me right and so so uh so i'm like all right. and i had to deal. with that whole [ __ ] like phone call i don't like talk i gotta talk on the phone. to people yeah cool and texting me. i'm like i don't give a [ __ ] and like this. whole [ __ ] and it's like it's like these this is the word the most annoying thing is like to. be like everyone's got their [ __ ] like i'm i'm crazy. i got my own [ __ ] we all got our. own [ __ ] we're all trying to. fit in this world right. everybody's talking about i live different. you know what i mean. and we're all trying to. [ __ ] live in this world together and go cohabitat and uh and like just like have your craziness have it affect the people that at least have it affect the people that you love do you know what i'm talking about like when you're in a [ __ ] like when i'm in a cafe and somebody walks in and they're obviously crazy and they're just like hey science is everywhere do you like lizards and you gotta like deal with that you know and it's annoying. as [ __ ] now i understand. it's sad because the guy's brain. broke and he's homeless and he's [ __ ] dirty and like who knows what. happens he's got a drug problem. he's got to suffer. from addiction it sucks but like in that. moment a guy walks in does. that and you're affected. everyone in the coffee shop. is affected and you're like oh for [ __ ] sake we had to. deal with that okay it's fine. we understand right but then there's people that actually fit in society. and they're not as high of a grade. of a person at as these crazy. people who walk into. the coffee shops and say. science is everywhere but they like affect. [ __ ] that you do in your life right like if you're gonna drop your car off to. somebody to fix it. or if you order. an apple pie out of marie. calendars maybe the person you're ordering. it is one of these people. and you got to. deal with them and they affect your life. and fine that's okay. you know it's annoying. as [ __ ] but it's like dude i gotta deal with it in a work situation okay but then there's people that you see like every day they're not necessarily your friends and maybe you have one or two or three or four or six people in your life like that especially if you know a lot of people or you're a comedian because compete comedians are [ __ ] not so dude right and and you gotta like deal with these people like i have people like this in my life like at least my [ __ ] upness and my craziness at least it affects only the people i love my mom my dad i blew up my life but [ __ ] it affected my mom my dad my [ __ ] kristen you know what i mean my brother the people that i know [ __ ] very well and know me we all went through it together but dude if you're gonna be somebody that like comes in and just is annoying. as [ __ ] around because you got your own [ __ ] and it's affecting us. and like it's my fault. that you're not gonna talk to. your mom about this. [ __ ] that [ __ ] sucks am i making sense here like imagine being like a guy like that like like a guy walking into. a place and you're like oh here comes.
