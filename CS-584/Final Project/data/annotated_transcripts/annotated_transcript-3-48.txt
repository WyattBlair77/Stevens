that was entirely. too long of an intro. but it's all good my babies and i and i hope see daisy i smell. like cologne is it my fault. no it's not did i hug. a guy with cologne. yes i did is it. all good yes am i worried. that it's gonna be smelling like perfume. and kristen's gonna have questions. yes dude but it's okay cause it's obviously drakkar. noir the worst kind a perfume. or whatever the [ __ ] it's called cologne dracar noir. you know the [ __ ] syllables in that god damn it. you got to be so armenian. to be wearing drug card. noir so armenian or so [ __ ] russian to. be wearing drug carne noir. a few spritzes hey. before we go out dog. a few a few spritzes. dog right on my adam's apple. dog right there a few spritzes. dawg a8 get my a get my bottom half. too right hey get my bottom half. too right just in guess. i get lucky no seriously. hey watch where you're touching. dog i don't touch your face. um so uh uh yeah armenians. love smelling good artificially and also love telling. you about their [ __ ] boundaries physically. um hey spray it hey not there bro hey hey i wouldn't come to. your house and spray. you there would i um so yeah i do it. but i do i hug. a [ __ ] i see a dude at start i went to. starbucks back of a cow's. mouth does it how does it. taste terrible how does it taste. zero to ten how does it taste. really bad the only thing worth getting. at starbucks four shots over. ice because they can't really [ __ ] it up do they [ __ ] it up yes they kind of [ __ ] it up do i still get it yes because i need the caffeine and cause it's not so far ah yes i do i get it and i drink it do i drink all of it no why because it's so bad yes so i only drink half. of it it's fine. the ice melts too quickly. because it's not big enough. and it's all good okay. now i come home the starbucks. is somewhere nowhere to. be found i wish i had on my desk but it's not here. is it okay yes does it make me. remedy yes but it's all. right because i'm chilling. and we breathe through. it right my babies we absolutely. breathe through it we deal. with emotions here's what we do um so yeah. so i got to. starbucks and i see all of a sudden a dude. and he's standing in the light. and i realized wow first of all. i think handsome dude. and then i think i know this dude. and then i think how do i know this. dude and then immediately i think that's how i know this. dude and i knew the dude. and then he goes what's been going. on and i say hey what's up. dude we clap. hands we [ __ ] hug boom that's when i notice a waft. of drachar noir and we don't like it. but it's all good but that's life. sometimes you hug a russian dude. and he gets drakkar noir. spread all over your neck. and that's life you gotta turn and then when he says goodbye you hopefully. hug him in the same. place so it's only that one spot. that smells like it but that's life. he goes for the other cheek. and then hugs you and then on the both sides. yeah you smell like drug car. noir so as you go. back to your car. you smell like rock 101. that's life yeah and then you go back. in your car later and then all you do. is smell [ __ ] goddamn dry car. noir that's live you roll the windows. down and then you hear the clicking. sound because the wheel on the back. left tire is absolutely cracked. and every rotation you [ __ ] make the wheel go you hear click click and you're so [ __ ] mad cause either you're hearing. click click and you're reminded how [ __ ] shitty your wheel is or the windows. are up and you smell. draconia and that's life but whatever. dude my babies would keep it nice. we deal with emotions. here dude and we're riproaring in our. periwinkle shits dude i can't wait to. get on the [ __ ] road man. and just absolutely be crushing. it on stage dude. can't wait man bringing the whole family. with me bringing calvin bringing kristen it's going. to be so ill dude. it's going to. be so ill adult. halflife i mentioned [ __ ] goddamn attack

[ __ ] year old [ __ ] i gotta [ __ ] get there dude i've got 11 years i know i'm the ripe age. of [ __ ] 42. i get it dude. god man somebody was talking so loud on speakerphone the other day. they walked into. a cafe i was sitting in the cafe. and this dude was talking to. speaker phone walks into. the cafe orders on speakerphone and somebody on the [ __ ] speakerphone whoever they were talking to. says well yeah but did you know. that yada yada about somebody and then i said oh really real. loud and everyone looked at me. but that's because that conversation must have been for all. of us it was on speaker. and you were in a public. place we were at a [ __ ] cafe so if he's on speaker then i'm involved in this conversation you think in 11 years i won't be [ __ ] belting out [ __ ] at a gate at [ __ ] delta you think i won't you think i won't say i won't you're talking to. the guy who wore all white. yeah dude i think it's [ __ ] fantastic. when people stand up. for what they believe in in that. way right i think it's great. too many people are just singing. in the [ __ ] uh lenses of their camera. and putting them on instagram. that's some bit [ __ ] dude. oh you're really a singer. then oh you're really a singer. then go out to. the [ __ ] gate of delta and absolutely belt it. out you raise me. up higher than a [ __ ] mountain. do it at panera bread. even though it should just be panera because panera means bread. so basically the place. is called bread bread. you raise me up. at relax the back. go go do it higher. than i could even [ __ ] be you raise. me up at susie cakes. or cvs [ __ ] go do it how does he keep coming up. with [ __ ] stores it's because i [ __ ] just did the ones at laurel county. in ventura boulevard dude. that's what's all around the laurel. county and ventura boulevard they got to. relax the back dude wow relax the back. dude the worst title. for a [ __ ] company it's still around. how does it like chris. webber [ __ ] didn't some basketball player make it relax. the back dude that's the [ __ ] relax. the bank that's the worst. [ __ ] that's so who made it no basketball player. you don't know some basketball. player has a stake in that like it's [ __ ] uh dun dun. hi sharks i'm chris webber. you're tired of your back not being off. you're tired you're back being all stressed. uh what do they sell like lazy. boys or recliners or some [ __ ] kobe dietrich that's a basketball. player i knew it he knew it. dude he's a [ __ ] encyclopedia britannica what the [ __ ] he knew it. i'm hot as [ __ ] this room. is [ __ ] three feet by three. feet um so yeah dude. but uh what was i saying. i don't even remember what i was. saying but i love it. i love it i love it. we gotta get to. that [ __ ] singing part of life you gotta get to. that part dude that's why. i say life rips because once. you realize life reps no. matter what happens right. like say you eat too. much sugar and you get [ __ ] cancer. at 65 right and you realize oh [ __ ] it's pancreatic i'm donezo. because that's one of the worst. ones i'm done so you gotta know life rips by. then you gotta know that. [ __ ] that's why life rips because there's the negative [ __ ] and the pendulum. swings right some people before they die. they realize the best [ __ ] of their lives they realize what life's. about not me i don't. know what life's about i try. to figure it out but you know. it's really hard what is like i don't like those. big ass questions though. like what what's life about you. know like some richard attenborough. [ __ ] everyone wants to. know what the ageold question anytime. anyone says to. me anything about any ageold. question i'm i don't want to. know any ageold question the answer. it's age old means nobody figured out. before me nobody's gonna figure it out. um but yeah dude. have you guys come across. this [ __ ] it's like a reddit it's all over. reddit i don't i i've literally only been on. any reddit because of stuff that ivan. gets rid of sends me i don't. really understand it you can like vote. stuff up and stuff down wow. it sounds so old but um dude. this thing he was showing me. is [ __ ] hilarious it's a tinder. thing right where they just show. tinder conversations like before. they date or something like that. yeah and uh like this. is the tinder reddit page. i guess a
