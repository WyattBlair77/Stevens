from the makers. of um and why if you uh from the makers. of why if you uh and um comes stutterville. things are so [ __ ] awkward that we only put the cameras on the guys who aren't talking we have to. film their reactions critically acclaimed already. even though it's not out. and only nine people watch it. comes stutterville about somebody who's obese but we pretend. like they're healthy stutterville from. a shorthaired woman i think comes. stutterville it's like all right. i'll watch i don't want to. watch it dude. i don't want to. watch it put a gun in a vampire's hand and have them blast away. i'll watch it put a dragon. with a [ __ ] heroine problem flying. out of a burning. building i'll watch it. from the makers of oh from the from the producers of the cameras filming. the

me man. don't push me i gotta sit there. and watch this [ __ ] [ __ ] it's just it and i like hbo i mean dude how can nine people watch it and this is why hollywood's failing because they're pushing that [ __ ] and of course uh it's a sniffing an agenda smelling an agenda and you know i'm sniffing it out i'm a [ __ ] doberman pincher on this [ __ ] you got an agenda i'm a doberman okay i smell it all right and i smell this agenda and so it's like so now i got you know and and hollywood well nobody's watching the [ __ ] oscars or the emmys anymore. because god damn it did you see who's hosting it. [ __ ] amy schumer like who even. [ __ ] like dude it's that's so 2. 000 and [ __ ] 16. they always get the person that was like hot. and too hot four year. five years ago. to po you're late hollywood. you're [ __ ] late dude you're late you know that's why every show right. now is about blm blm was so [ __ ] 2019 it's unfucking believable. dude hollywood's late oh you have a show with brandy. in it now no one. gives a [ __ ] that was so 2020. and now it's like now it's like the emmys and the [ __ ] oscars are trying to. catch up and it's like dude. you're too late and now we gotta nobody's gonna watch the oscars. with [ __ ] amy goddamn. schumer and wanda sykes as the host. from the producers of the oscars. this [ __ ] would have banged in 2017. jesus. christ for [ __ ] sake why don't you get george hamilton and a razor scooter to. host it it's so [ __ ] ridiculous dude. brought to you by aol. i mean for [ __ ] sake dude. brought to you by someone. who used to rule land. in [ __ ] 1600 dude. it's so old nobody gives you [ __ ] and then they keep pumping out this [ __ ] to. [ __ ] you know to. make 10 000 people happy. and then they and then it's critically acclaimed and then the oscars. don't give a [ __ ] so they give the awards. to the people nobody's watching this. [ __ ] remember when they were gonna put [ __ ] black panther in for the best uh they were gonna have black panther for because because the [ __ ] the the agenda was trying to. [ __ ] push like oh well there's finally a movie for black superheroes and then they were trying to. make it so uh it won. an award so it was like most popular. movie at the oscars and then everyone was like this. is [ __ ] it's about art and then they took it back and they walked back on it dude. it's like just do first of all. that was a good idea. to [ __ ] give an award. to the most popular movie. that's all the oscars should ever. be the oscar should be six minutes. long and it should be some [ __ ] tick tock. star and he should just be like hey guys this. is the oscar today the award. goes no nominees dude just a guy who comes out. with some stupid [ __ ] back of a duck's ass hair in the front with some [ __ ] idiotic. dance move with the [ __ ] uh what's that. cardi b song hey guys it's the oscars. hey guys chillax it's the oscars. we're keeping it lit. the winner of the oscars is. black panther that's it that's it. and then it's over dan. on it now thanks for watching. the oscars and it can't. be over three minutes long because that's how long you got to. make a goddamn tick tock. for dude it's nobody's watching this. [ __ ] and i gotta from from the makers of a woman in a small town with a flannel. on comes i'm i'm just like that's why. all these [ __ ] that's why these youtube. you see the talk to. the kids my my buddy's got a fiveyearold and he's like are. you on youtube i'm like [ __ ] i've been on nbc. he goes what's that what's nbc. stand for [ __ ] new big cocky i mean. come on dude they take lumps. of [ __ ] every week new wednesday. eight o'clock lumps of [ __ ] starring [ __ ] john cryer lumps. of [ __ ] so anyway dude i don't want to. watch it i don't care uh whatever dude. it's like i don't know man. let's i or i gotta watch like the [ __ ] thing that's hot. on netflix like tinder swindler. and like it's uh and everyone talks. about it for a week. and then it's gone and i can't even talk about it. on the podcast because it's too. late and now i can't talk about tinder. swindler because everyone's already [ __ ] talked about it because it's been a [ __ ] week ago. i tried to watch. that yeezy [ __ ] documentary genius or whatever the [ __ ] genius dude mexican hey have you seen genius hey you seen that union movie dude [ __ ] yeah dude i didn't watch [ __ ] genius that's the other thing too it's like we're celebrating kanye west when he's literally telling people to.
