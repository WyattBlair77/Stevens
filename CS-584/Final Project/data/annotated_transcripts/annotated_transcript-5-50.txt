[ __ ] the [ __ ] out of here i'll tell you though we make music a big deal and i don't think we should i think we should footloose dude. when they're talking about dancing. and how no there should be no dance and i get it. i get it when that. [ __ ] cop flips up the kevin bacon's driver's license and knew his [ __ ] chin that was definitely ad lib you could tell by the way kevin bacon reacted but there's a thing where kevin bacon gets out of the car and he's playing music and the cop is like why you playing music and he's like yeah is there some law against and the cop goes like this hey don't talk to. me like that and flips his id. up and into his. mouth and and kevin bacon. the way he reacted you know. you know that it was was adlib. and you know the director was like hey cop. [ __ ] flip his id. up into his [ __ ] kevin bacon face that's how you get real [ __ ] i don't like when they do that in movies though when they do real [ __ ] like i heard on that that denzel washington like straight up punched somebody on john q dude if let me tell you some anybody if any actor i don't give a [ __ ] who they are actually punched me in a rehearsal or some [ __ ] oh my dude i'm not even i'm not even gonna punch him back i'm gonna [ __ ] their [ __ ] that's what i'm gonna do okay i go like this if it happens i get that's my punch okay i go like this all right yeah okay let's do the scene let's get it down let's do it and then i [ __ ] by the way murder the scene i don't care if it's whatever it is i murder the scene cuz i used the punch cuz that's what he wanted me to do anyway right okay and then i go and i [ __ ] meet the guys girl on the internet i dm the i dm the chick after rehearsal and after shooting and then i [ __ ] go and i meet up with her and we make the [ __ ] out i don't even do it i don't even have you know i don't even have sex with her i just make out all disrespectful with her and then she wants it and i say no i can't because i'm better than that i'm that good i'll make out with your chick i have to [ __ ] am i even talking about dude this podcast is such [ __ ] but anyway what i'm saying is we make music a big deal here i also heard in that movie that nicole kidman and tom cruise did it that's that father dude when when couples do movies that [ __ ] is like like a ho but it's really them it's like it's acting but it's really them it's interesting it's got another layer on it no just get two [ __ ] people to do the thing not that they were both they were both really big stars far and away that's what it was far and away weird where they played irish people and and there was one part where tom cruise had a ball on his dick and nicole kidman was supposed to open up the ball and look at it and react about his dick and there was a cloth covering tom cruise's dick but tom cruise. was like hey man she's my wife. why don't i just use a [ __ ] why don't i just you know have no cloth. on my dick and see we're gonna we'll get we'll get her. real reaction and the director was like and that was the one they that was the one we used classic. cinema far and away dude. i love tom cruise. i love nicole kidman. there isn't a movie i would rather. see less than far and away. so much brown in it. brown walls hair brown vests. skies brown have different colors and. only brown and a little bit of light. blue and that's it and maybe some pink every now and then like the cheeks. of the chicks and some wallpaper. and the most bitchass hats. and 47 boats for sure. oh and sun and sun time and sun and sunlight. umbrellas deal with it how's that. if you're out in the [ __ ] if you're out in the in the sun deal. with it get a hat. with a brim on it. or that's it no [ __ ] sun sunglasses. do it i mean sunglasses are cool but uh umbrellas if shit's not coming down out. of the sky [ __ ] put your umbrella was. that oh it's a [ __ ] one fires telling me it's called a parasol and i'm no you know what it's called an umbrella that's what it's called parasol. the only time you can use a parasol. is if you're [ __ ] so asian or super duper. white in the 1860s. if you aren't either one of those and also if you're asian you. have this parasol you better. have your white gloves. on um anyway uh anyway i'm on my app here. and we're talking and i see the comments. coming in and you guys are you guys. are giving me good. comments somebody just wrote fart. away okay cool it's cool my thing my fanbase is really smart um and some other person said the movie with tom cruise and and what and what and nicole kidman. was far i was a eyes. wide shut which it is. but also i was talking about far. and away um so anyway we make music a big [ __ ] deal is what i'm trying to. get it and what i my point. is here his music. is so much of a big deal. that i feel like cuz i saw this. everyone but cuz i gotta talk. about this cuz everyone's asking me about this. and it might must have been because i him. on my podcast but but maybe not people. like what do you feel. about xxx 10th st on. by the way you name change it just be extension alright now i get you died. and you got shot and nobody really well. not nobody but you know. people are like well whatever you did you didn't. deserve to get [ __ ] killed that. that was [ __ ] up by the way 20. years old shot dead. apparently he was robbed. and in and and and [ __ ] out there just videoing it. and putting it online. i caught it by mistake. i followed this instagram account. and it was like and all of a sudden. i realized like i was i'm scrolling. i look at i'm looking at this. guy's dead body and i unfollowed that. page because like dude. where are we at the fact. that we have come to. the to the point. where we're videoing dead. bodies and posting them online like just in the intrusion of not even privacy. but decency it's just so gross. to me and dude. and it takes a lot. to offend me man. but like posting it and doing it even even. if there is a dead body somewhere to. even get closer to. it is weird as [ __ ] to. me let the police deal with. it these people were filming. the police filming the [ __ ] i didn't want to. see that [ __ ] and if if that were to. happen me i wouldn't want. people to see it. for for freaking for me it's just sad. and you know did the kid. deserve to die now obviously. it takes a lot. for somebody's orders die. now but my point is with the music. is like look he did. make good music you can't. you know i liked his i thought his music. was really good it was. different it was soulful it. made me feel [ __ ] you know and all that what the guys personal. life was [ __ ] terrible. i mean he beat the [ __ ] out of a pregnant. lady and a pregnant girl that he was you know. and this is all her her saying it in her. account but this accounts. were so specific and [ __ ] that it's hard. to not believe it but he ran. into a lot of trouble. and in his life he was a troubled. troubled kid and so now ever before he died. everyone was like oh [ __ ] this guy he doesn't deserve to. be doing concerts and [ __ ] he doesn't deserve to. be making art and this. and that he's a criminal and now that he died. everybody online is touting him like the next [ __ ] tupac. and it's like i know there were these [ __ ] people out there that were just like uh he's a terrible person. and then when he dies. like i can't wait to. fire this tweet out alright p xxx. 10,000 nah man bury yourself dude. get out of here that's so annoying. dude people who weren't even fans. of them are just like oh man. just heard his music. what a shame you don't. even know what you're talking about. dude you don't know what you're talking. about i mean look people like other imagine imagine chris. hardwick died tomorrow they would just be like yeah well he isn't it weird. the [ __ ] like i feel like music or hiphop it's hiphop or whatever the [ __ ] it is but it's like i was talking to. my buddy and we were talking. about i was talking my buddy. about this and i don't know i don't know if he'd want me. to even say his name i'm a podcast. but because of what i'm talking about. is um but whatever it is. is a touchy subject but he was like dude. it's uh it's a it's like it. only it's like it matters. more when women give a [ __ ] about this stuff. like women are women obviously obviously girls. girls like hiphop but like athletes they get away. with beating the [ __ ] out of people and let's play in the nfl. but women don't give a [ __ ] about sports. generally i know obviously. there are some women that care. about it but like but like so so they get away. with it but the fact. that some of the like when you're in the zeitgeist. or whatever like you know. if you're in the comedy. world or the acting world or the production it's like so many women give a [ __ ] about that so we demonize all these guys. that are in those in that life. because of the me to. thing but not these football players. it's [ __ ] insane dude there has to. be a standard there has to. be a standard and that's it. and you know like are we gonna believe women. or not that's the thing. are we gonna [ __ ] believe women or not because if we are then how are you gonna act like oh you know such a shame that xxx tense. has hyung got his [ __ ] [ __ ] got what was coming to. him well then you don't believe. the [ __ ] girl that said he put a [ __ ] fork in her vagina. okay then you don't believe. that girl i mean who who this. is a [ __ ] touchy thing to. talk about but like this kid. who made great art was a piece of [ __ ] that's it whether he's dead. or alive that's what it. was okay yeah did you know. he didn't deserve to. die i think did he deserve to. thrive off of his career. not if all that shit's true. with that girl saying and if we're gonna believe women. you got to go to. [ __ ] jail for that but he wasn't gonna go to. jail there's no [ __ ] way there's no way he was gonna go to. jail dude there's no way. it's weird dude it's weird. what people pretend to. care about and then let slide it's so [ __ ] weird how could you let that slide maybe you guys themselves when they act like cuz there's creeps out there that are feminists to. man and they just use that i mean. i think most of the guys. feminists are probably like that they use that. because they're like oh i can hide behind. this and everyone will think i'm a good. guy but really you go. out and you have a [ __ ] abusive relationship. with a girl just that people hate fake. [ __ ] and they they can't wait to. get you on some [ __ ] that's why. politicians fall so [ __ ] easy you know that's it's it's it's like if yours it's almost like if you're a scumbag you're impenetrable if you're a known scumbag what was it uh i don't know anyway let's talk about something lighter i guess deardon anyway i you know people are like rest in peace or whatever but you're just gonna people say rest in peace do you rest in peace are you just dead i guess it's peace if you're not doing anything i the culture that we live in where people are just trying to. expose everyone is hilarious. and then and then and then how about this when we when when i just found out who that. little tay was that little asian. girl who's like i got money. i'm 9 i got i got all. these cars and houses her mom. apparently her mom was a realtor and just videoing her. in different houses that. she was trying to. sell and they found her like footage of little tea. not doing that stuff and everyone. was like oh see we told you it. was all an act hey dude if you thought who looks at. this little taste [ __ ] and is like oh i got to. figure out if that's an act or not. what do you what are you what. are you talking about she's 9. it's an act she's being coached obviously. how do you fall for some stupid. [ __ ] like that lillte is an act because she's 9 and no 9 year. olds have a bunch of different. houses and stacks and racks and racks and stacks. of money dude she's not. but she's [ __ ] nine years. old how do you just start. out with nut with money she doesn't have a job she makes no money stop people like lula exposed know she wasn't exposed you know who's exposed you cuz you're [ __ ] idiot
