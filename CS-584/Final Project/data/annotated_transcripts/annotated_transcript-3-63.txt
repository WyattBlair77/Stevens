[ __ ] hope for the best but it really is something that i struggle. with like i feel like i walk into. rooms and people don't like me for a reason. or not and it's been that way. ever since i was a [ __ ] kid so i'm like these comics probably think that this is their scene which it is and i'm just coming in and and i [ __ ] walked in with this. idea of what it might be like and i watched. some of the comics and they were very good. and um and then they were like do you want to. go up and i said okay. and i went to. the green room and there those comics. were and uh one in particular. i was like this guy's gotta hate. me you know because he was he was funny. on stage i'm like he probably [ __ ] hates a comic from l.a i walk. in and this dude. says wow it's so weird. you're in here i drink. coffee out of a life. rips mug every morning. and i was like isn't that just like life. dude and it made me feel good. and it made me you know. i keep trying to. [ __ ] store this information that i get you know like i get mad at my buddy. for saying vulcan when he should say vulcan. when he knows it's vulcan. but i am living the same. way because i know that this preconceived. notion i have that people just [ __ ] don't like me when i walk into. a room is not true. because they it's it's ego. based do you know. what i mean i'm assuming. that people even would would take a look. at me and think [ __ ] that guy like either either the either they know who i am. as a comedian and they and i'm thinking oh they probably don't like my comedy. which is uh so insecure. but that's ego based like why. do they even know who i am. or they're even looking at me. thinking anything is ego based like maybe i'm just a guy. in a place right. and uh and i have to. get over that and so and and that was another instance. in that green room that i just have to. get over that showed me. that i just [ __ ] it's all made up in my head you know we live with these [ __ ] constructs in our [ __ ] heads that are just so idiotic. man and then we have these memories that. we build up that. we color as well like truth. happens and then we color. it a different way right. oh god it's like it's like humans we're too. [ __ ] smart for our own. good and too dumb. for our own good you know. it's like that's what it. is i wish we were either. just these people that they create in movies. that are like i use 80. of my brain this is the year. 2090. or why can't we just be a [ __ ] lizard. like really why can't we just be some midbrained [ __ ] you know. oh like i saw a documentary. on a a trex and he was like trying. to it's that new thing. on apple tv the prius i thought it. would be good for calvin. to watch until i saw a [ __ ] trex eating a bunch of turtles. and i was like oh this. is too violent. these these need to. be more like cartoons for him to. understand otherwise he's just gonna this. is like dark [ __ ] that he gets you ever. put on a documentary for your kid. because you think it's like about animals. and then it's like you know the duckbill platypus is. actually very violent it. [ __ ] and it kills and [ __ ] its prey and you're oh okay okay all right. we'll go back to. coco melon and um and so we wa so i'm watching. this prehistoric thing on apple. tv which is done by written. richard attenborough of course dude you know can there be a documentary. about something grand that richard. attenborough's not doing like like he i think he did. i don't know if he did planet. earth or what or if even. there is he did planet. earth and now he's doing prehistoric life. and it's so funny they tried. to make it a little bit different. than planet earth but the similarities. are so striking because i get the same. guy that not only are they so striking that. now they actually show cause on. planet earth he's just like the frog. is [ __ ] licking a leaf. for an hour and a half. and the mate comes and depending on how the frog. licks the leaf the mate. will come and look what they do. they're the only animals besides human that. do oral copulation the frog. lays on its back and spreads open. its frog [ __ ] and the other frog. eats it out and then um and then now it's so much. like planet earth that you. could have just smelled that. you smelled the [ __ ] executives being like it's too much. like the [ __ ] planet earth so let's just film so they film. richard attenborough now like next to. a skeleton you know have you seen. it they film them next. to it david attenborough. who's richard attenborough oh we just thought david attenborough. it should be richard you know. david attenborough and so david attenborough. is it richard attenbero. is the guy in dress. are they brothers they gotta be they sound the [ __ ] same jurassic park whatever who cares. he'll find out but uh anyway david attenborough. so richard attenborough is the guy in the jurassic park. with the white hat and the white suit. they're brothers and they're the white hands. right soon anytime i see a white guy. with white hat i say [ __ ] i go dana like a piece of [ __ ] and he knows he pretty whenever a guy wears a white hat i go [music] [applause] [music] now and so so david attenborough is doing the thing and they film him now because they were like we got to. film them next to. a [ __ ] skeleton trex otherwise it's too much. like platinum or planet. earth and they film rich. david attenborough and and his hair's. all messed up and it's hilarious. because it's like like if you watch this. thing on apple tv the prehistoric life. or whatever the [ __ ] you he rich. david [ __ ] whatever it is dude. i'm going to say. richard or david just get on board. david attenborough is sitting there. and he's just like the dinosaurs. are you know from a trillion. years ago but what you might not. know and his hair is like got this [ __ ] cowlick and it's it's like you know the hair and makeup lady. were just like should we fix it. and then another person said he's 107. like what. for what right like at what age. do you get to. where just it's not even. like looks are not important. anymore it's just that they're not even achievable right. like old guys just walk all hunched over. with [ __ ] just pink splotchy skin. and they just don't give a [ __ ] but do they still get boners. do they still want i hope. that goes away dude i hope that goes away. one time my friend my one time. my friend said do you think that when you get to. heaven and i said i'll stop you right. there i'm gonna answer no. but he said do you think when you get to. heaven like you get to. have sex with whoever you want to. and i was just like i i don't know. man you know this. is just like what is his deep. thoughts by jack handy and he was like i think in heaven. they remove that sexual. urge and that you could get to. just chill and it's not straight. and you're not stressed out about it. and i was like okay. and he says that dude. and if i told you i didn't think about him. saying that every three months. you will your boy. will be a liar. [ __ ] i [ __ ] it up [ __ ] it doesn't matter dude i i think about it all the time even though there's probably no heaven. yeah worst game show hi. guys welcome to. probably know heaven i'm your host alec. baldwin um so anyway so david attenborough. does this thing and it's it's violent. as [ __ ] and his hair is all messed up. you got to see it. and uh they make it really good. though like it's one of those series. that you watch and when you watch. it you're like oh this. is when they should make they should have never made this. until now because they look like real [ __ ] dinosaurs that are doing this because the cgi is so good so i'm watching this trex swim which by the way i didn't know about this but in five minutes i learned. david attenborough said the tyrannosaurus. is actually violently effective in water. and i was like oh well let's i'm in you. know already and so he's swimming with the young. trexes behind him and it's like but the tyrannosaurus. isn't the biggest [ __ ] thing on planet. earth it's another [ __ ] thing a whale that's [ __ ] like two times as big as the tyrannosaurus. rex and then they show the big ass. prehistoric whale you know just lurking and it's like but don't worry. the tyrannosaurus is effectively violent. in the ocean as well. while swimming but what he has to. worry about is the trex's. [ __ ] young and then the trex is young. is like me me trying. to swim and then the big ass. whale comes and eats the thing. and i'm like do i have to. turn this off but it kind of showed. it off screen like it just showed the little blip. of the trex the mini trex. just go underwater and so my son. just thought it like took an extra dip. and but i'm like i got to. turn it off because then they started eating. a turtle and [ __ ] and my son kind of likes turtles. so anyway i got off on a tangent. because of that but really what i was. trying to say is i was in dallas. and austin and i don't even. know why i got off on a tangent. that hard because even in the middle. of the tangent i was like. i still gotta get back. to austin and now i don't remember. but so uh i went and i did. the creek in the cave. and um [music] it was nice i did. a set for like 30. minutes and it was actually really cool. because like a lot of the comics. like the room was kind of like emptyish. and then as i was on stage. i think other comics came and started. watching it you know. and it's always the comics. that watch in the back of the room. it's like there's [ __ ] seats that are left open. and the comics are all in the back. of the room just judging you. know so to get them. to laugh is good even even even if they you know a lot more were professional and a lot more local but a lot of them were open micros. but even to get them. laughing is good because you know. comedians don't really laugh this. is how comedians laugh. ugh right like we'll be in the back. i remember being in the back. of the [ __ ] comedy store. whatever it is upstairs at the laugh. factory watching comics and they do a joke. and you're just like huh. oh yeah right mmhmm like you're filing. papers that you forgot about. oh okay it's just our business. you know and so we'll watch it. and we're just like okay. now yes he get okay. all right so he pulled. one over on me. for a quick sec but i get it. now um so uh yeah and then i got off. stage and it was great. we had a good time. uh i know i didn't really wanna. i didn't really know if i wanted to. go up and kristen was like you should go. up let's go let's go. up and i was like all right. cool we'll [ __ ] do it so we left calvin. at the airbnb dude. we took out an airbnb. it's like a [ __ ] kristin booked. an airbnb that was like severely discounted. because it was like tuesday through. wednesday or [ __ ] one monday tuesday. wednesday or some [ __ ] and it was like so marked down and it was like this. baller ass place. with a hot tub first of all. 107 degrees in austin bro anywhere beside hey anywhere to. the east of phoenix saunaville dude. anywhere to the east of phoenix. saunaville take albuquerque anywhere east of that. sauna i can deal with. the heat if it's dry dude. anywhere east of phoenix there better. be a [ __ ] old asian man. with a towel wrapped around his midsection too. high walking around with [ __ ] flipflops. that my buddy in high school. would have worn to. soccer practice before he took the field. otherwise you're out of your element. dude because you're in a sauna it's just too hot. no matter where the [ __ ] you are may. on may on and i can deal with 150. degrees if it's dry put the misters out my lips might crack my anus might get bloody and instead of [ __ ] air will come out and go me up and i won't [ __ ] for as long as i'm in phoenix because of the heat keeping it up in my colon but dude when you step to. the right of phoenix saunaville dude. how do people live in like north carolina. i'm gonna i want to. look seriously in your face. i know you can't see me. but a lot of you are watching i know. i know i can't see you but a lot. of you are watching me. on uh on youtube hey people in north cackalacka. hey just real quick and i want to. be serious people in north kakalaki what do. you do what are you. doing dude it's too it's [ __ ] you can't breathe. man may on may on i mean.

[ __ ] you know because it's too hot. he's doing that hulk hogan thing. oh okay i get it. there go my dogs. barking shut up your incels. let me calm down i was out. today in los angeles and it was fine. so i was in austin. so hot did two shows. one two poppins mike linochie. was like can i promote. you i'm like no i may not do. it and he was just like please. and i was like no you're welcome. for just popping in but don't promote. me and it was still packed. out you know because he kept saying special. guest and i was like we know who it is dude. you open for me. special he's like my i'm his best. friend special guest big special. guest so we had a good time. i did about 45. minutes that's way too. long but whatever and the thing. is i'm coming to. austin i just don't have it. yet all right right now i'm working on other dates. i had i was trying. to get the right theater. and it's booked everything's booked. for covid you know because of covet. all the other comedians and and musicians. and even magicians are out. there like trying to. get these spots and so i will do austin. and i will be back. and then we went to. dallas dude and the whole reason. why we went to. texas anyway was because this person hit me up. and said hey will you do a corporate. gig now if you're gonna ask chris deleo to. do a corporate gig the answer. immediately no why because corporate gigs. are notoriously horrible they're worse. than college gigs okay because corporate gigs. are a bunch of 60. year old men that are just sitting in a banquet hall. somewhere that happens to. be in a [ __ ] hyatt regency or a radisson inn. and nine sixtyyearold men come up. and try and give inspirational speeches. about how they came up. in whatever business has to. do with this corporate gig. and it's emotional or it's very bad. and then there's like a life coach. and then they say oh yeah by the way. here's a comedian that you probably. don't know about because we aren't in his demo. crystalia and they give you the microphone. and you're like so what's the difference between men and. women you ever go to. [ __ ] home depot and it's like what and these sixyearold. men are like bring on. paul ryser though so. it's an eat shitathon. so i wanted to. say no but then i'm like you know. what what is this company. i asked what the company was. it's a company called sphere. rocket now obviously that's a fake. company because that's not a real. name but that was the name they went. with and that's and i bought it and whatever and i said to. kristin hey i'll do this. gig if you come with me and calvin can come i wanna i wanna buy him a cowboy hat and she was like i would love to. go to texas so i say it's on. [ __ ] so i said yes they said what are your stipulations. i gave them a bunch. of stipulations and then they said yes and so i said okay so i say prepared. this is going to. be [ __ ] awful i say can i bring somebody. to [ __ ] wet the room. up for me you know. so mike lenocchi came wet the room. up for me i said he gonna do. 10 minutes you know. they had a guy try and stand. up for the first time. ever and then mike linocci. and then me so the guys. so we get there and they're like hi. welcome here's the green room. the green room is not a green. room the green room is just a. room that [ __ ] happens to. be there and they're like we have your club. soda and i was like oh that's amazing. i actually said i want. a club soda this. is hilarious like i don't. even have a ride or people. was like what's in right. i'm like i don't know man. what do you think i am. kat williams green m m's. and don't look at me. you know i just uh water. and so if you make club soda. and if you make eye. contact with me more than six. seconds i [ __ ] my pants. and you have to. clean it up deal sign. on the bottom line so um so we get there. and it looks fine. you know they're talking there's a life coach. talking and then another comedian. that's trying to do standup. and it's you know it's going. about as well as you'd think it's the first time. you ever tried doing standup. but i can't tell how good the [ __ ] audience is because this guy's on stage for the first time. ever right and i don't know i don't know how to. gauge the audience there's about 300. people 400 people there. so i say all right. mike go ahead and try not to. do too much crowd work. because i might have to. [ __ ] do it right like a lot of you guys may not know this but as a comedian. like last resort in a in a corporate. gig in a company they really want you to. roast them right so so i'll that'll be my backup plan because i want i'm supposed. to do 45 [ __ ] minutes. and i can't roast them. for 45 [ __ ] minutes right. so i'm gonna start with material. if that doesn't go well then i'm just gonna have to. roast them so i tell mike dude two do 10 minutes. but don't do too much. crowd work because you might have to. leave that for me. i'm going to be out. there in a sea of people. that don't know who the [ __ ] i am. or maybe they do right. but this is the [ __ ] that's going on through. my mind so mike. goes out there and starts. crushing okay he starts doing. some crowd work which is fine. and it's going really well and then he starts. doing his material and he's doing his like edgy. stuff and it's crushing. so i'm like okay good at least. they're gettable but also what if they just like mike. what if i'm out there he's doing 10. minutes he knows he's doing. 10 minutes he's got the confidence. of hey i'm mr. 10 minute guy here's my whole. hot load for 10 minutes. and then your boys. gotta go up the mr. hollywood oh professional let's see. what you got dude. for 45 minutes so i'm like [ __ ] and now i'm feeling it. and yeah i just did the creek in the cave. and yeah i just did the vulcan. gas company and yeah. your boy crushed a lot. but this is a different story and corporation. get corporate gigs absolutely are. you know they're terrible. so i get out there. and i'm like i'm gonna do material. i'm gonna get out there. i'm gonna do my material. mike wet up the stage just like he should have like a professional. i'm gonna get out there. and i'm gonna [ __ ] just do my material and it's gonna be smooth. sailing so i get out there and the first thing i do is i say hey guys how you doing hey look at this guy what's up with this guy boom i'm in crowdwork already some [ __ ] baby. he immediately succumbs to. the pressure i yes dude he immediately. wants to take him. down to crutchfield ah yes he's insecure. he's going up oh i'm gonna do this. this this got my whole setlist ironed out. in my head goes up. and says hey guy what's your name. ah yes insecurity peeks through. the veil he wanted to. crush so soon he wanted. to get to the set. so soon he thought that maybe that he was gonna get up. and do some crowd work and then he thought. that maybe he could ease his way. into some material so soon. he absolutely went up with a plan. but then life smacked him in the face. but he's a professional right. so he's breathing within himself. and he's telling everyone about this. new guy that he's talking about doing. crowd work and he just starts. leveling the place he just now. you know me i don't mince. words but he just starts. ordering a roof for this. place because this one's getting blown. off now you know i don't mince. words i like to be honest. and i like to. keep [ __ ] subtle but he just starts. praying for the third. floor because they're gonna [ __ ] crush their spines when they fall through the roof of this. banquet hall which happens. to be on the second floor. so i make fun of this. and i got a lot. and i noticed mike lenocchio like a [ __ ] homie. is out there getting it. on camera he's getting. a lot of it on camera. and your boy did so i start. so now i do 10. minutes of crowd work and then i'm like let me. just test the waters on. this material let me. just test the waters okay. i test the waters. water is freezing cold. i test the water water's. freezing cold was crushing. with the crowd work go. back to some material material. water's freezing cold so i go okay maybe let me check the water. a little later get back. to some [ __ ] crowd work and now i got to. start praying for the people on the third. floor again and i'm not religious. i hope i'm doing a good. job but i'm not religious. but this roof's going to. give out do you have hey crowd do you have. on your fire retardant. suits then it's going to. be a doozy so i do 20. minutes more of crowd work. i'm on stage for 30. minutes i start to. dip into. some material water's freezing cold. and i don't bomb up. bombing material but it's just not what they want. so i get up to. 45 minutes and i've probably done. four minutes of material if that. i would say i did 41. minutes of roasting this. audience and they're loving it. okay and i finally say well. guys it's about time to. wrap it up and the ceo stands. up from the back of the room. and says hey chris and i say yeah. and he says gotta he says got a message. for you and i go uhoh. and his the person who put the show. together walks up slowly to. the room and i'm like what the [ __ ] is happening. she walks right up to. the stage and goes like this. and i'm like okay i guess she wants the microphone. so i give it to. her and she says the ceo. of the company would
