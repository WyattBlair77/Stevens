[ __ ] like that but he did say that. i want to. find this video and i can't. find us that's great. on takashi six nine i should probably do this. [ __ ] before i start and bio and do it like that because i want to. do it the way i want. to do it and you guys. are here for me. for that this is his instagram. 6:9 i'm back in they mad. he says just made everything. up himself here we go. he talks about the [ __ ] i want the world to. know that okay so first of all. he's wearing grandma's panties on. his head so already what you're saying. is not going to. be as interesting as what the [ __ ] is on your head. so that's a huge criticism if you want people to. think you're interesting what's coming. out your mouth is interesting. don't wear grandma. panties on your head okay they're literally silk pink. panties that are just like flopped on his head. they're not even pushed back. they're just like it looks like he's the [ __ ] the chef. from the muppets that you can. tweak and he's dressed all in white like he shut up. to paint with the grandma's panties. on his [ __ ] chef from the muppet lost. his lost his job. no no chef where's this. is he's the chef from the muppets. he's wearing all white and a [ __ ] a hat that looks deflated. it it looks like he ran. out ideas and he's got so many [ __ ] jewelry's on and for watches wearing a for watches because he's too too poor to. get a watch that tells different timezones. he just has one for each time. zone a guy atlantic i got pacific. i got central and i got the other one. that nobody ever talks about the one. that phoenix does that they go. halfway to. a year they go. back and they halfway a year to. go the other way um i think i commented on this. i wrote for watches yeah there it. is and somebody wrote bro. who are you my that's my favorite one. you can number ones. on they do it in a more. echoey room by the way six nine do it in a more ecobee room. literally did it at [ __ ] in a lobby. somewhere hey what's up. you kabob billboards that's the rest. you by number ones on billboard. now let me tell you what happened. we have an ongoing investigation. just now legit we was having with we was having an ongoing. investigation we was having an ongoing. investigation dude so wouldn't get the part. if he auditioned for nypd blue sir. we've we was having an ongoing. into the investigation why can't i ever say investigation. it's all good this dude. is [ __ ] just rosie perez with face tattoos that's who he is rosie. perez we was having an ongoing. investigation dude that's actually the dumbest. sentence of all time. you either were having an are having an investigation. or there's an investigation. that's ongoing you can't have had an ongoing. investigation hahaha we was having an investigation. that was going on that's still going. on just so [ __ ] it up we must having an investigation. that was the own going to. see if i could wear panties. on my head and it turns. out that on going i could opinions on my head. and i wearing panties. on my head i got four why'd you want to. know what time it is. on the atlantic it's 3 o'clock. you want to. know what time it is. on the pacific that's a 12. or wait 60,000 units last second. what the investigation we found this. stop saying investigation dude sit trying. to [ __ ] sound more legit. you know with the investigation. we found this people are just commenting on this. [ __ ] oh wait where's the [ __ ] they purchased half. of those things with six credit. cards when we asked where were those. six credit cards winchell. billboard said we can't destroy that information. understand this they bought 30,000 and so units with six. credit cards okay we get it. he says that nine times during this. thing by the way six credit cards six credit. cards i got grandma panties. on my head six credit. cards we have we was having an ongoing. investigation six credit cards where's. the [ __ ] thing about when he put it on when he put the ongoing investigation he talks about the apple what's where's his [ __ ] stupid instagram there's so many goddamn instagrams for him takashi's six nine goddamn [ __ ] you know what dude i this is just i don't understand oh here he sending it to. me complain she six fine yeah. he says that's like what. you're saying you an apple it's an apple but also you know apples. red did you see. that [ __ ] were he's like apple is red. and what of course no. tiles are apple green but it's like saying apples it's like you see. apples red and then somebody say apple. blue six credit cards say idiot. also how is he still alive. like i don't want anybody to. kill anybody but how the [ __ ] is he still breathin. dude he snitches out here its twitter so i could fastforward it the apple. thing he says dude. here we go where's the apple. thing if you want to. explain to all the hardworking. artists out there the hardworking artists. that and it's a bizarre. said that because there's a lot. of stablish artists right now that don't get number one thing how you did duck if there's 50 million streams. right on goober why. only count 30 million right. so like looking at apple. say i'm obviously looking at you're red. but you're not but you're telling us. is not red but you cheating right so confusing. so confusing it's like an apple you. look at it i've read you. looking at it and it's red. and then someone's saying it's not red it's like you're cheated you. got caught redhanded you. saying red so many times just so confused. it's like little red riding hood came up. to you and said this. apple he's like you say her apples red. and little red riding hood is. like that red apple. now red you got caught. redhanded wearing red wings it's like little red riding hood where red. wings drive a red ferrari. with red man in it. and red foxx and he'd say the. apples red and apples red. but the red fox like the apples. not red and then you got co. redhanded cuz you cheat in red. i'll read a book it's his favorite color. yes it's like red foxes in a vet comfortable. with you and you there. and you said apple red. okay and then a red man. pop in and he say over. the apple not red anymore. and you got caught and you and you know. the apple read and you read. a book on it and you like you read. a book on cheating and you like you got caught redhanded the worst. analogy of all time congratulations. complain see six fine dude. the way the way it has no payoff is. amazing right apple sometimes is most likely read. something that's always read. you know apple is rare you know sometimes. it's green sure sometimes. there's in between an apple. could be very you know. very light green or dark. green but but most of the time. we think of apple is. red just say a [ __ ] you know what's red rudolph's nose. just say [ __ ] what is always red. my [ __ ] um red swollen dick was an episode. of ten minute podcast. ha ha scimitar never gonna be running for president. but anyway complaint u6 fine. obviously he's probably dead by now. i just started talking about it. but and then snoop dogg. made a warning takashi six nine which is great. snoop dogg's ninety last time. he says i ant hey snoop dogg. get better lighting it for your youtube. video you've got seven trillion dollars. he literally looks like [ __ ] one of those people that would do uh why is he [ __ ] filmed by one of those people in almost got away with it but i just wanted the below that or when i was ik buddy. or he was illegal. when i was lawyering but today and they i got time. snoop dogg you're 90. last time you said some i had a tire. but today i got time. wow you've got to. get the [ __ ] off my line [ __ ] mmmhmm rat boy. rat boy you really better. leave me alone i ain't. the one oh [ __ ] no way no way. go on and do your [ __ ] and get out my way [ __ ] you funky don't hit rainbow. head don't get [ __ ] so here you [ __ ] little lead a dog alone. better leave the dog alone. i'll find you again getting. too far away to. carry with the analogy better. let the dog alone. better go find a cat. you know they make me. unhook my leash you know. me i'd be done eating. a bunch of dog food. all full you know me. someone a knock at the door. and i start barking you know. i'm saying piss on [ __ ] the side of a couch you know i'm saying better. find yourself a cat i. got so far with it. i you know i got a collar did. you lose your [ __ ] mind i got faux legs. man i even got two. arms i four legs you better. not [ __ ] come for me. hey dude you're [ __ ] 60 get it. together you know i did i love it. man i [ __ ] love life you know you got this 22 year old that's like you know you got one apple that's red you know apple will you look at it apple is red i mean some apples is green are you looking at this apple red and somebody come up to. you and they're like the apple is. not red and then snoop dog's like i'm a dog. don't come for the dog. don't come for the dog. y'all looking for a cat. go get a cat because i'm the dog. i got faux legs i got instead of when my arms are got paws. and legs flip with the dog. talk with the dog. and then nice nothing nice [ __ ] cool. tourette's red boy rat boy. again he close closer. with the rat boy oh and then [ __ ] the hands up for no reason. oh god i would love if somebody if like a troll like takashi. 69 or these guys who are trolls. um well not even trolls. guys who were famous for kind of doing. well i can see me. he makes music a kiss. he does nothing but like guys who are trolls. like guys who just want attention. so bad we'll say like takashi. 69 donald trump me. know like like these guys that [ __ ] just are crying. for attention you know the chicks on [ __ ] in story norse the dudes on instagram that are like you know kicking back if just nobody ever paid at i give some guy was a model you know the male model like is a chair he's a [ __ ] just a chair right modeling is for chicks if you got a dude there you're a [ __ ] prop. you're the you're the [ __ ] chair for the girl. to sit on it. doesn't matter okay yeah your bone. structure is nice but you're really just a [ __ ] chair that guy. that if he like for a guy. to win did for him. to join instagram and then have him. just be like look 0 people. felt like as zero. followers or if like donald trump tweeted some [ __ ] crazy fantastic [ __ ] and nobody said [ __ ] about it or takashi 6:9 came out of jail and nobody was like that rapped [ __ ] i'm gonna kill him if nobody gave a [ __ ] that would be so detrimental to that [ __ ] but we can't we can't not look at it we have to look at it because that's the [ __ ] train wreck that's happening you rubber net you like huh you got to. look at it it's like when the apple is. red you know it's just such a [ __ ] it's a bummer. it's so [ __ ] funny man. i [ __ ] god i was watching this show married. at first sight it's on netflix. i don't know if it's a netflix. original or what but it's a show. where

then like the girl says they'll go. out with them and then the guy smiles all cute. and [ __ ] but guys do this [ __ ] and i didn't understand quite really what was happening with this tick tock [ __ ] i didn't understand like i didn't understand who was like watching this [ __ ] like it'll play this [ __ ] like this guy does this guy what's his name devon k. hurley is one of my favorites. he'll he'll do you do only pov. ones and it'll say it'll be like part. it'll be like twelve parts. and it'll be like him. meeting a girl they're all 15. seconds long like this is part. 10 she comes

it. says it's a guy's face. she walks in he's your brother. home and then he goes and it says no. she's not you have to. read it and then he he should be coming home and then she says i'll wait for him. and it's only a picture of this. guy's face and i'm like 40. like que unit i mean. i'm like 40 and i'm like que but then i'm like why. is this a good thing. and why is this part. 10 and then it goes. up to there's part 12. you decide to stay. over and when you wake up. you see me getting ready for the day. this one's two seconds. and this has a hundred and eightynine thousand. views and he just puts. on his shirt and he just goes why. is a hundred and eightynine people watching. this thousand people watching this. was a hundred be watching why. am i watching it. and i'm like who is

waking up. to that i'd be dead somebody else comments. oh if somebody writes i'm kind of loving. these povs keep it up. and then he responds good. god it's weird dude. people get in you're like hahaha this. other one who's loki blushing. a little right now but i realize these people who are commenting their five like they're for real. learning to. type i i just imagined. that that people my age. were watching this [ __ ] cuz i'm my age. therefore everybody's my age. because i'm conceited or whatever. the [ __ ] selfcentered and i realized that everyone was five when i posted. mine i wrote me when i meet my boyfriend. and tell him i love him. and then he [ __ ] dies and i put i put it to. this song and then i wrote i write i love you. i say it says the week. and then i said oh you love me. too nice and then i go. a crazy look and i said oh [ __ ] you fell off a cliff. and a grab for him that's my peel dude. and i did that for me. so i could laugh at it. and some people are like relatable this happened. to my dad sending prayers. away of course they're joking. somewhat more povs this is you're calling a joke. obviously then people are commenting on other [ __ ] i can't look at you the same. after you the show of course cuz i played child. molester somebody wrote no 50. no please 50 no which is a reference to. this podcast and then somebody writes something like man. this is actually really sad. and i'm like oh i'm like but what no. oh man this is actually. really sad no it's not. you first of all you don't meet somebody and right. away say i love you in them. they

thought it was the worst thing i ever saw online. every my life like ever in my life. i never saw a worse. thing oh my life do you have it. or getting it i ice texted. it to you guys. oh it's probably

me find it there's my ticktock that i did that was beautiful where is it is it this far back come on dude alright here we are we thought we got it we took it took a small break. to find that and now i got it. this is they posted. it the the vibe for billy. formerly known as julian posted on. twitter although it's not his original. video it's this girl i'm gonna actually leave her name out of it. oh wait no was on. pov hipass never mind which is the best. on ticktock but this chick posted. it it says me and my boyfriend. in quote or in parenthesis who's black get pulled. over he goes to touch. my face after i tell him. that i love him. then the police officer shoots. him so she plays us and then she goes oh my god like he gets shot. what the [ __ ] like that now at first when i saw this i thought oh man. this is horrible and then i found a video of this. girl who's like an apology. video and she's like i just want everyone to. know that i mean it's like she's like twelve. twelve and it's like the cutest thing. she's just like i'm really sorry. i didn't mean to. offend anyone and i'm like this. poor [ __ ] girl like she doesn't know dude let me tell you something. man i didn't know i wasn't mature. until 30 [ __ ] 15 until i was thirty fifteen okay for real though until i was like early 30s i would do dumb as [ __ ] [ __ ] this girl's like 14 doing this and of course i couldn't tell cuz i was just watching it nobody looks 14 anymore. that those days are well or long gone. you ever see a [ __ ] 14year old she looks 30. i've never said there's no such thing. as a

[ __ ] anyway they dragged her i can't remind them but they dragged her but this chick. was 12 and so i saw this. apology video and i was like oh [ __ ] i jumped to. a conclusion thinking like this. idiot and like it's my bad. because this girl's [ __ ] however old she is she was like i'm so sorry. i had just read a book. and i was trying. to be socially aware and i didn't realize. that i wasn't trying. to do it for a following. i was trying to. do it to. like get the awareness out there and i realized how it looked now like this girl is like legitimately learning this. lesson for the first time. on a grand scale and that's sad. and i've been and i feel for this. [ __ ] child because she gets piled on now. granted it's like i saw a tweet. the other day person gets canceled. because something that they said. when they were 16 it's like dude. i was 32 saying dumb.
