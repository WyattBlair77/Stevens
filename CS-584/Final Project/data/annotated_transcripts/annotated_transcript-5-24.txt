with somebody who identified was a guy but also dressed as a woman i don't really know the whole. main [ __ ] or the whole technical. [ __ ] about it but anyway he she i don't i don't know if he goes by he or she but he they they exposed him and now um everyone's like [ __ ] oh all the [ __ ] ignorant people are like ill gross. he's gay which is stupid. you know like that's what i was. talking about before the break. i was like oh yeah well like basketball players. gay basketball players would be the [ __ ] you know they're there anyway but they can't come out. of the closet which sucks. because of the culture um and uh it was amazing. i just went on online. and i looked at people like i looked at people. um [music] like bashing. him for it you know. it was just like sad. like sports culture just they as of now. they're just they have no room. for out players which is so stupid. um and i tweeted that. this guy tweeted. this thing uh pull it up you know. what i'm talking about uh oh hell can't. oh hell no i can't. believe i shook dwight howard homo ass. hands now with a crying. emoji and then the picture of him and dwight howard and then i wrote this guy asked for a picture this. guy asks for a picture dwight. howard was nice enough. to take it with him. then this [ __ ] finds out dwight howard is gay supposedly i don't know or whatever and uses the picture to. slur him because of that this is the worst kind of [ __ ] so i went on this guy's timeline and i looked at his timeline and just to. you know see what kind of guy. he was and he was saying [ __ ] like against gays uh and this year so he writes uh yeah go down there look at this guy what is this guy's weird arguments dude famous people and people with money are not always happy christilia has been mentioning me since yesterday. that's sad i mean he keeps writing back. to me um yeah i know i just wrote about how he's the guy's an [ __ ] and the guy's like oh you're a comedian. you you're a hypocrite. because you you don't say sorry. for your jokes and i'm like yeah. but it's not a joke. the guy's like he said oh yeah. don't mention allah's name. with with lgbq or whatever. is it lgbtq what is it they change they keep changing. it i don't know i'm such an idiot. but um he was like yeah. allah he said don't use allah's. name with something like that. talking about some guy who is for lgbtq. uh i go down and then uh he says lg lbgt. and religion don't go together. and every lgb lg lbgt member knows this read. about the story of prophet lut and restudy. religion to me your loss. but to each his own. which is like he's saying like you like don't. be gay and so he's going. on and on about how it's not right. and then he's like calling me. a hypocrite because i'm making a joke. about it or no. because i make jokes. and i don't apologize for them. and i'm like what the [ __ ] and then under this guy's [ __ ] he goes um like i scrolled down on his page and it was like saying [ __ ] like listen before you judge and understand before and it's just like who are these people dude. who are these people it drives me. nuts that some but first of all. first of all it's annoying. when somebody tries to. say you can and can't do this. we all know that nobody likes. that [ __ ] okay so to. say like you can't [ __ ] a guy because you're a guy is absolutely [ __ ] asinine and then to. take the picture to. ask a guy for a picture. because you're a fan. and then have the guy take it. nice enough didn't have to. and then be like oh look at this. [ __ ] guy who doesn't do what i want. him to do and post. a picture and shame him for it. is just you're the lowest. kind of person you're up. you're a [ __ ] [ __ ] dude you're a you're a piece of [ __ ] you got what you wanted and then you're like oh he's not what i wanted ah [ __ ] it i'm gonna put him on blast you're you know what you are you're a [ __ ] hooker that's what you are you're a [ __ ] [ __ ] dude you're not a real man your attitude changed nothing changed but you if dwight howard was gay he's gay then he's gay then too your attitude changed so now you're going to. put him on blasphemous when he was nice enough. to take a picture you're the worst. kind of [ __ ] [ __ ] dude religion sucks dude like they [ __ ] put all these rules. on who you can't put your dick. inside of it [ __ ] sucks. like straight up yeah okay. you have a good family. unit because of religion but let's get it. to [ __ ] gather religion. you [ __ ] suck if you think you like i don't oh god it it's so hard to. talk about because it drives me nuts. like these religions was like yeah. do whatever you want but also don't do that. like how how do you not see that. you're a piece of [ __ ] [ __ ] religion if that's what you're doing i know so many religions are like that no i don't believe in gay. oh it's a choice oh this. and that why does it. even [ __ ] matter that much truthfully it. doesn't it truthfully doesn't do you want to. see it i don't want to. see a guy [ __ ] a girl out at a [ __ ] starbucks i don't want to. see any of that [ __ ] it has nothing to. do with being gay. i don't give a [ __ ] it just sucks. dude if you're the kind of person. that thinks i'm religious. oh yeah oh yeah but it's good. for the families but there's all. right well so what i don't give a [ __ ] be good for the world. also let people do what the [ __ ] they want. as long as they're not hurting. anybody i just it. drives me nuts man it'd be so cool if a basketball player. came out of the closet. and was like i'm gay. and i i'm gonna still do slam. dunks but the the it. makes it i mean dude. he'd be [ __ ] legit beat up. his like life would be in danger. and that's a a huge problem um i wish the pope. would just come out and be like you know. hey catholics be gay if you want i don't know whatever. hey catholics be gay and then i ain't got no.

sometimes. anyway have a good day. los angeles so funny. david lynch love his [ __ ] uh and john cassavetes best favorite of all. time because that dude. i read books on him. and [ __ ] first of all he he was the only uh director to. me that i've seen i'm sure. there's other ones there. are other ones i'm not that. cultured but like to. me that dude captured exactly. how life was and he made a movie called. husbands with peter falk ben gazera and john cassavetes in it isn't it and it's a real hard movie to. find but it's it's that. and swingers are my two. favorite movies to. watch it's so much captures what it's like being a guy more so than any other movie i've seen it's so funny. and so good and i [ __ ] love it dude i love the movie. husbands it's my favorite movie. these guys just their friend. dies and then during the eulogy or doing the when the priest is giving the eulogy or whatever. it is they're just he's just being very general. about it he's just like yay everyone loved him. he was a great guy. and you know he this. and that and then afterwards. the three dudes that i mentioned. they're in that they're driving. from the funeral they're driving from the funeral. and they're like they're like they didn't that. was a [ __ ] eulogy they didn't even [ __ ] talk about how he really was and these guys to. deal with their grief they just leave and go to. paris i think it's paris. or europe what london london. it's london yeah it's london. yeah it's london and they go. and they just go and they like go. for three nights and they like are flandering with women. and [ __ ] and they're just being such dumb [ __ ] [ __ ] guys and it's so funny um [music] i love the movie it's so funny dude also i like cassavetes movies because you can just turn them on whenever like in the middle and just watch them woman under the influence is amazing dude. that uh what's the lady's name. uh what's her name. again jenna rollins he was married. to her and she's in that. movie and she plays a [ __ ] like a mentally unstable. woman and she's so it's one of the best. performers i've ever seen also faces is. a great movie it's so hard. to watch faces i mean. it's so boring but i love it. i love boring movies. sometimes he was the best. man john cassavetes i love that guy's [ __ ] movies a killing. of a chinese bookie loved it. that movie got panned too. but i
