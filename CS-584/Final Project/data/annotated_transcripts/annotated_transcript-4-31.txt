[laughter] we honestly didn't [ __ ] even talk about the hell yes because the laugh. was so overshadowing now let's go back what we do is we watch clips. we single out the most uh moment. and then after that sometimes. we're forgetful but sometimes we go back. no we have to. go back the strongest moment. of the clip was the laugh match. okay the strongest over. most overshadowing moment in that clip. was the laugh it's like in that. new king kong godzilla movie when the [ __ ] airplane landed on king kong's chest when he was dead and they exploded. him to [ __ ] make his heart go again. natch that's the most wow. moment how did that get past. everybody how did this guy live 55. years however many years and get to. the point in his life. where that's his laugh. okay after something he said i don't like to. say this a lot. because it's ingrained in internet. culture now but goals okay the confidence of the helies could only be somebody with eight billion dollars well yes you know or

unreal and a cowboy. hat dude i'm surprised he didn't have. a [ __ ] eagle on his arm with i'm surprised. honestly it's not he didn't have. an eagle on his arm. and a [ __ ] cat on a leash and then also the space suit when it zoomed out it that he didn't have pants. on didn't have pants part. of it didn't have pants. it was a [ __ ] dress because he just doesn't give a [ __ ] like a [ __ ] short short dress and the answer the answer the question he's answering is is that is that a skirt hell yes [laughter] wow the last are the best he's just running he's about to. pass out um calvin's. been

like they're friends. and she was like really and i'm like yeah. dude they're friends and then it was like a preshow. thing and dustin was like i'm gonna kill that [ __ ] because [ __ ] him because what he said and then i'm like what is what is the thing. that happened because something has happened. right and i didn't know what it. was until after the f. we all know what happened. he broke his [ __ ] leg and his his his uh leg look like a [ __ ] spaghetti noodle and and then dustin was like you know what everything. was cool until he said he was gonna murder me. like dude fighters are hilarious. that they'll just get locked on. this one thing that when you're like that's crossing the line. he said he was gonna murder. me and that was it. that was the thing i couldn't i couldn't take anymore. say whatever you want say you're gonna [ __ ] my wife's mouth do not say you're gonna murder me it's not cool. man there's no coming back. from that he said like it's so weird. you know what he's you know. what dude you know what made me. lose do you guys used. to be friends what happened. well fighters will be like you know what he said i couldn't make a roast beef. sandwich and honestly that's where i'm gonna draw. the line because i know to. use middle bread i'm gonna kick his [ __ ] ass really yup. that's what it is he said. i couldn't make roast beef sandwich. but i got all jews for day. okay i get all jews. for day and i say day. because the s is selling. on days because oh you the ssl. nanju so go [ __ ] yourself man esses are silent are you losing your mind yep

wife and family. over hot coals i can. deal with that but when he said i can't put together a mom malm that's something at ikea. when i can't put together a mom. quick enough that was it that's where i draw. the line that's when i knew i was gonna win. and that's why i stuck my whole. arm in his [ __ ] during the fight that's why i did that because i wanted him to. experience the same pain that i felt. when he said i can't. put together a mom he said i couldn't get i couldn't find. the exit out of target. that's what he said he said. he could get out of the target. quicker than i can when i know. i've been there way more many. times with my wife than he has with his so i can handle. him saying that he's going. to [ __ ] send my wife 900 monkeys and have to. deal with that until she calls animal. control but i can't deal. with i get out of target. quit [ __ ] and that's why i secretly brought this machete shetty and lopped off his head during the fight yeah fighters dude that's like

or whatever the [ __ ] they are in mario um and we played and what was i gonna say about that so follow us. on flex avenue follow. follow me on flex avenue. i'm gonna do some more gaming. with her but i'm also gonna do some gaming. solo maybe who knows dude. maybe i'm a gamer now. did you ever [ __ ] think of that. stop being on my [ __ ] case. maybe i'm a gamer now. um i forget what i was. gonna say but it was gonna be something. so rad [music] previously on congratulations. i'm guy fieri welcome. to dragon balls and eyesores and punk [ __ ] that was the rad. thing that i [ __ ] said [ __ ] it i didn't want to. do it i forgot it. so that was what it. was anyway um i don't remember but twitch is pretty cool. i had fun the screen. was small and then we made it bigger. we [ __ ] it up a little bit of course i haven't got rid of in one fire. and then one fire came over. and was there and then [ __ ] left i had no idea [ __ ] just drinking white claws all the way. home just [ __ ] opening white claws when the music. drops just waiting listening to. siriusxm oop it's time. sorry little kids but i'mma kill. a clown today today [music]. i don't know man we got merch. up um on the uh [ __ ] uh we've got the life rip stuff. all out i'm wearing light. right the life rip [ __ ] right. now the shorts dude. these shorts are [ __ ] hell yeah. dude move the chords tangled [ __ ] badass. dude anyway we lose our. minds babies we lose. our minds let's get to. this log cabin so we can just quit. you know everyone needs. to oh i was reading. the tick tock comments. and i i stopped whatever dude. it doesn't matter we fly. by the side of our pants. on this episode um yeah so and oh and we're gonna put the twitch. link in the youtube bio. so you can just go click that. and [ __ ] follow me on twitch. on my gamer now. um oh i remembered what the [ __ ] i want. to talk about i had to. take a break to. remember it and i can't. remember it dude. remember the game [ __ ] goldeneye dude. when i was when i play who the [ __ ] i stopped playing video games. when you're supposed to. stop playing video games by. the way and that's 23. years old you're supposed. to let it linger after. high school for a little bit that's when he stopped now. one fire's looking at me. like no he's going like this. no and the reason is because he plays warzone. and he probably also like [ __ ] literally buys fake. video game guns in the [ __ ] video game or more more more ammo or some [ __ ] whatever i don't know it's dorky to. do that people do it. fine he dude he definitely bought a skin. before you know what i mean. like what it's a homer. simpson skin and so uh hey look when he gets. killed um how much was it. it was a thousand dollars. and uh but dude i love that. win the game that's what i'm saying. all the cut scenes bro. get them out of here man. remember goldeneye dude goldeneye i never played. a video game more not goldeneye perfect. dark dude that video game perfect dark. with the grenade launcher bro. i was lethal with the grenade. launcher in perfect dark i was [ __ ] lethal you couldn't first of all i couldn't find me i was like a [ __ ] zit on your back you can't find me bro but it hurts it hurts when you do okay now i didn't realize that that analogy was going to. be so bomb when i started. it but it really was i'm like is it. on your back you can't find. me but when you do it. hurts um yeah dude. and i would just fool. across the [ __ ] it would hit the wall. and you're gone bro you see red. and you're gone that was perfect dark. played it so much played call of duty a little bit but that was when i was like all right. this ain't no perfect dark. and perfect dark was no. gold then i do those boxy. ass james bond guys. just running with the [ __ ] know with the my with the mind. and just here he goes. boom let it off bro. that [ __ ] i was killing. it with that and then that was it. dude but goldeneye was the [ __ ] perfect dark. was when they lost the rights. to the james bond franchise. they made perfect dark it's the same. game but it's called perfect dark. was on gamecube i don't even remember not gamecube but one. of those [ __ ] n64 that's what it. was dude i haven't get rid of coming. in with the [ __ ] dorkiness. dude we love it. anyway man i wonder what it. would be like to. play those games again. you'd probably be like it'd probably be like those old like to. not play it now after i was playing like really good games. it's probably like playing [ __ ] uh the little thing with the with these things and the ball. goes and hit between them. [ __ ] what the [ __ ] was that thing called what is it pong. yeah and then i played also there. was another version of it. later on in nintendo but anyway who cares. you know that one arkanoid. dark olympics anyway um arkanoid dude. why'd they call it. that dude why'd they call it. arkanoid do you know why they call. it arkanoid dude yeah but arkanoid. dude arkanoid wow wow i was the arkanoid. king the worst king um so yeah you know it. was cool to. [ __ ] have my dad on on the episode 200. it was very cool to. have my dad on it. was really not you know. i i wasn't sure you know. i don't ever have guests. and uh except for my brother. and i thought you know. what 200 i got to. do something nice and fun. and special i thought i did i i thought about maybe i didn't have to. but um i was like i think i should eventually. and then i asked my dad. i was like would you want. to be on my podcast. and he was like sure and i was like oh hell yeah. we got a lot. of [ __ ] to. talk about like the calamari. like the tea like the [ __ ] um toaster and we got to. the hardhitting issues man. almost threw up and um my dad. uh my dad and then i posted. a clip on it on instagram. and somebody wrote this isn't funny. you've done it before. and it wasn't funny. the first time when you talked about the [ __ ] pasta how many meats in the pasta. and i was like dude. maybe you just don't like me. why are you following. but we got to. the bottom of it dude. basically i get really pent up. and about how people saying certain things and my dad's saying certain things. and my dad just doesn't give a [ __ ] he goes. okay and i'm just like it. can't seem much okay. um but it was great. to have him on dude. i love my family. it was also cool to. have my dad on uh because you know. that's one of those things. where i was like maybe i'll have my dad. on my podcast and then it's like he's 73. i mean he's probably gonna live to. be [ __ ] 95 with the way he is but but you know it's like they're getting older and [ __ ] you ever think about that oh man i don't need you i don't i don't want to. go down this road but i did. do it oopsie daisy i went down. that road it's like your parents. are just gonna dude one time. i was in therapy. when i used to. do therapy the first time. didn't really stick i wasn't really. listening to her but she said. uh we were talking about parents. dying and [ __ ] and she was like yeah the only good thing about your parents dying is that you don't ever have to. live through that again. and i was like end. of the movie with the credits. bro you if you don't get it. i'll explain it after well. the only good thing about your parents. dying is that you never have to. experience again holy lowly was. the lonely places lonely faces traces and i think it's kind of funny. funny when it's sad. can i find this lesson. medics in it mad [music]. what the [ __ ] oh [ __ ] dude [ __ ] it i want to. do it again well the only thing. good about you dude. i'm so annoying man oh [ __ ] i'm i'm i don't give a [ __ ] dude oh yeah the only good thing about your family dying. is that you don't have. to [ __ ] go through it. again as it is again. a funny place sunny traces bunny. faces independent kind of money doesn't matter.
