[ __ ] go to write. a word and it auto. corrects to the last name. of a [ __ ] x and you're like oh for [ __ ] say okay well yeah okay yes i'm sorry baby but yes i i that's why it says riddick instead of ridiculous i meant to. write ridiculous but yes um adapt to. remember up to. ten floor plans okay so users can carry their robot to. another floor or separate home. where the robot will recognize. his location and clean as instructed jesus. christ people tend to. think of amazon as an online. seller company but really amazon. is a surveillance company wow. that is the core of its business. model and that's what drives its. monopoly power and profit evan. greer the director of the nonprofit digital. rights advocacy organization fight for the future. told wired wow that name. you know hi i'm evan the director of the nonprofit. digital rights advocacy organization. fight for the future. wow what a dick. what are we gonna do. though um this alex jones. trial is crazy in the beginning. i was like when he got sued. for four million dollars i was like oh man. that's a lot but it did. uh [ __ ] you know cause these families a lot. of pain and [ __ ] and suffering. um and a lot of these like one of the ladies. had to move ten. times or something because his this. is the [ __ ] thing about people say free. speech it's like okay so the guy thinks that uh sandy hook. is a hoax that's just one. of those things that it's like if you were in a [ __ ] someone's party. and you just kept saying this. not on a podcast just like in someone's living. room and everyone was just like it. was new years and everyone was just like it. was like that [ __ ] you know everyone was just listening to. music and then [ __ ] this [ __ ] is in the corner. just like you know that. the [ __ ] sandy hook thing. is just uh you know. it didn't actually exist right. you'd they'd be like what. everyone else in the party be. like what maybe there'll be one. or two other guys that were like that. were swayable because they're [ __ ] made you know they're like they make a lot of really good points. but they're also kind of drunk. too and the music's just playing and it's [ __ ] and the guy all night is just trying to. get people you know the sandy hook. thing is that the [ __ ] they think it was a what they call a red flag. what they call it. [ __ ] false flag you know about those right. those kids weren't even real. right a lot of those. parents didn't even have kids. if you look into. it if you do your own. research that's the thing man. it's a false flag. and then [ __ ] all right dude it's it's cool. man all good it's just three two hey you you think about sandy. hook one happy new year. yeah dude it's great. this is a new year. but it's just another year. where everybody thinks that [ __ ] sandy. hook thing happened well they're all acquaintances speaking. of acquaintance i heard that. the acquaintance they weren't even acquaintances let alone. their [ __ ] children dude. that guy would get his [ __ ] [ __ ] handed to. him enough's enough dude. the guy would get their ass. kicked and now all these people online. can just pop off at the [ __ ] mouth. and this is how you remedy. that situation the defaming the [ __ ] you you get you get four million dollars. taken from you and then the second one. he now has to. pay [ __ ] 49 million dollars. hey i'm the mathematician but that's over. 50 million dollars and then there's like three or four. more [ __ ] things he's got to. do the guy's [ __ ] just basically here's the rule even on the internet don't pop. off at the mouth right. cause there's consequences if. you're popping off at the [ __ ] mouth you're gonna get punched in the proverbial. mouth one way or another whether you're that. [ __ ] at the party or you're that. [ __ ] online talking about conspiracies stop bitching dude whatever happened to. that [ __ ] no snitching. shirt remember stop snitching get that. [ __ ] remember that [ __ ] stop snitching. that shirt with the [ __ ] and everyone that. [ __ ] went nuts for a little bit it was like 2001. and then all of a sudden everyone's just like nah. but snitch you don't know. you don't know what really happened. that's that's my whole thing dude. like and i'm not saying yeah. okay sure some conspiracy. theories do turn out to. be true of course it. would be [ __ ] irresponsible to. say they're all not true. but like some of them do tend. to be true. just like sometimes when you hit on when you're playing blackjack. and you hit on [ __ ] uh 20 you might get an ace it's not likely but it could happen it's like that you know so like i don't know this guy is [ __ ] man what a martyr for these [ __ ] people who believe in lizard people uh i mean he literally thinks that [ __ ] uh barack obama and uh hillary clinton are lizards so all good and when they go in the ocean. frogs become gay that's what. he said cool all right. i'm back i went pp sorry. guys um bro i actually want to. play this dude this is the kind of [ __ ] i love i love [ __ ] like this this is so funny i one fire sent this to. me and my god this is like my kind of favorite.
