[ __ ] drink that's beige now i want it black cuz it's coffee. because coffee is black unless you put [ __ ] in it so did they put [ __ ] in it i looked and i was like i got an iced coffee. and they're like yeah that's it. and i was like okay. they were like you wanted. a latte and i was like but i ya. iced coffee and they're like yeah. is it an iced. coffee or [ __ ] a latte like what. the [ __ ] going on cuz i i still don't know by the way so i found out what i'm supposed. to be ordering. is an iced long. black and now i've been in australia. for about five days and i'm gonna look this up. on the internet now since i don't have my computer my my producer here iced. long black now i don't remember i've been here. for five six days i don't know if it's iced. long black or iced. black long but it's iced. long black and i'm gonna forget. that again when i ordered. it next time but basically it. that's what the iced americano. is here so now i'm walking. around saying [ __ ] iced long black. like an [ __ ] like i don't know what i'm saying. but every time i almost say ice. black long and sometimes i say black long and then i try to. think like okay it's not black. long remember that sounds like black lung. and that's a [ __ ] disease that you get so don't say that. once a ice long black but then i [ __ ] go there and i'm like wait was it not the disease thing. or the disease thing and then i say can i get a nice. black long and they're like or a nice long. black whatever the [ __ ] it's called and they're like yeah sure and then they do it and they always here's the white get it together [ __ ] in australia they they do it in the [ __ ] regular hot coffee cup they don't give you a [ __ ] plastic seethrough cop they literally so it's like now i got to. drink it in four minutes. otherwise the cup gets soggy. and it starts looking like a salvador dali. painting in my hand like a moon. like the melted. clock [ __ ] you're not i'm talking about put it in a glass put it in a seethrough cup. get it together and look there's something some good coffee. in australia but put it in the right. thing huh put it in the right. thing i hate when they give you know. when you go to. like starbucks or some other coffee. shop and they're like sorry we ran out of the flat. lids here's a dome lid ruined. my day i get it. my life's pretty easy you. give me a dome lid. on something that belongs. with a [ __ ] flat lid ruined. my day i get it. privileged do your job. right get enough [ __ ] flat lids. how about that how about that. how about that isn't that that drake. song it's annoying when i sing that. but get a [ __ ] dog don't put a dome lid on the dome lid put the [ __ ] flat lid on the fleurdelis how about that how about i don't so how about now that's what it is how about now since secure. that song you didn't like me. when i was broke. how about now how about now it's insecure. rap is so [ __ ] insecure though for real remember that song. what they've been they're like we eat so many. shrimp like that's how it starts. i think that's three 6. mafia we eat so many. shrimp like gonna get [ __ ] indigestion oh really ed. gross so many majendie

like austin though. where everybody's like dude. nobody says anything bad about it. everyone's like dude it's [ __ ] amazing. you gotta go it's [ __ ] beautiful women. great beaches such a cool. vibe and yeah it's good. it's good now granted i haven't. been to sydney yet. and i feel like that's gonna be my [ __ ] [ __ ] i didn't know there were that many asians here in melbourne. it's unbelievable dude. i went to. the asian area i guess i don't know what it. what it is it's like five. blocks of and you know what the other thing. too is like even though. it's english there's another there's a language. barrier like like oh i [ __ ] asked this guy i was on the hotel and i was like where's the elevator and he was like what and i said where's the elevator and he said what's that and i said where's the elevator and he said i'm sorry and i was like okay we did this three times already i'm very clear. i'm saying where is the elevator so let me. try to say it. again and not make it. seem like this guy's a [ __ ] [ __ ] so i was like like i didn't want to. be like where's where is the elevator because then i make it. seem like i think he's an [ __ ] so i'm like okay so i just said it again. i'm like the elevator where's the elevator and then i realized and then i just had oh the lift and he said i was right. down there like was this. guy [ __ ] with me come on dude. i understand you're australian and you call. it a lift but you know. what an elevator is dude. if i'm in america and somebody says where's the lift maybe i'll say what. once maybe but i'll probably just point. where the [ __ ] elevator is i feel like the guy was [ __ ] with me there's a lot of it he was asian so maybe that had something to. do like maybe he was from not from here. not from even australia. i don't know but then i went i stopped then i got some sushi and this. guy says the guy who's making the sushi. he was pretty good but he was like where you. from and i was like i'm from los. angeles and he says oh jewish. people huh and i was like uh ii. iii don't know and he said yeah. and i was like ah cool. and then he showed me his phone. and was like i have a fur the accent. i can't do it he was i got because he was taiwanese i came to. learn but he was like i have a friend who is from that area. and he pointed he showed me. his facebook and pointed. on on his friends profile and then where he's from and it was it. said colorado and i was like oh yeah colorado. yeah that i've been there. before he says colorado colorado and i was like yeah. yeah yeah it's it's it's far. from where i live in los. angeles but you know. i was like i guess. there's maybe jews there. i don't know because i felt like that. was the [ __ ] thing you wanted. to know about and then he was like oh okay. and then he said north colorado. south carroll or colorado and i think he was. thinking carolina and i was like i yeah. they don't do that in colorado. it's just colorado and then i was like what. the [ __ ] am i doing and then i left but there's like some sort of a weird language. barrier with like lift an elevator and [ __ ] and some people i don't know if they're [ __ ] with me they don't know what the [ __ ] i mean but like come on guys get with it get with it sorry just figuring out this [ __ ] device here cuz i don't my producer one fire so yeah so i don't know how i trailed off i don't

smaller. with no face and you're hairy. all over oh creepy basically. a spider is a [ __ ] guy that's so [ __ ] tiny. and hairy and then has eight legs. and no face oh that. yeah i mean try describe

about the fact that if your [ __ ] you know god this bag is just driving me [ __ ] crazy dude keeps blowing over here so uh when where that spider is at this point i you know what i feel a little bit like when i'm doing that podcast on my own is and not with my producer one fire is uh is i feel a little bit like bear grylls like i'm like here we are when i'm out in i mean melvin and i got like i think easier is he sound like that does even accent i think it does i'm all the way up in the 11th floor this hotel i'm just hunkered down i'm trying to. fall into something heat. gotta go in the minibar see what. they got they got cashews if you're lucky enough. you've want some cashews maybe some other [ __ ] that people would never heat. unless they're in out dowel room. anyway i was lucky enough to. find a pillow and put it down. here i got my podcast. think recordist plugged in there's a spider. in the bathroom should be okay. he's under old damp towel um so uh i do feel like that. but because i'm literally on the floor. right now cuz i need to. have this [ __ ] thing plugged in my producers like hey man easily you know we charged the thing it's fine. and i every time i get to. where i got to. go and i got to. do a podcast remotely it's never charged ever one. fire and this much does. have a bad battery life. or something but anyway i don't remember what i was going. to talk about but i'm always surprised. i can talk for longer. than an hour though on [ __ ] podcast i watched [ __ ] wonder woman on the flight over and also that a new planet of the apes movie. dude i watched that planet. apes movie man and how about the fact that did you see. that one it was the one. with woody harrelson first of. all the first 20. minutes are [ __ ] awesome okay there's like this fight scene and all these gorillas and [ __ ] and apes are like oh my god it's amazing. how much i really look and then it for like 50. minutes it's the the movie is only about the apes. and only one of the apes. talks so it's like a [ __ ] silent movie and they're just looking at each other and they're going home oh actually the one that it was a cool movie okay i'm not bashing a movie but the one thing that was annoying. about the movie was that they they show. tried to in your face. it about how hey these apes. are basically human like we did. it dude like we get we get the point. dude there were so many scenes where that. where two apes would. look at each other for way. too long and like all emotional. and [ __ ] and you were supposed. to think oh it's cool. cuz that's what humans do. you know like oh wow like they hold each other's faces. and [ __ ] and but it was like okay you know and there was music playing and it was like disabled. just look at it i get it. i get the scene can we go. to the next thing can i see. woody harrelson trying to. [ __ ] find these apes but yeah so much about the about the about the apes. and and and [ __ ] and then one and then like they weren't like but it was funny because they weren't like they were like they literally was like we're like oh oh oh like that's what the ape would do that's what it. would sound like ohohohohohohohohoh it. was like they tried to. make it like you did. you know that they told the people. who did the voice. acting that they were like you know. what definitely don't ape it. up because we want the apes. to be more human. it would just be like oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh it sounded. like they were just [ __ ] coming oh oh god oh my god. oh oh i swear one. time to a plane. oh god yeah all over. all take it take it. ah you don't like those disney. movies where they would have like a [ __ ] a sultan with a boner. like guinness [ __ ] either like what's a aladdin. or like what's the one. with the [ __ ] ariel like there'd be like a quick [ __ ] shot of like a sultan with a boner. the flux is sultan anyway. you know sultan all i know. is they wear crazy. [ __ ] like cool [ __ ] like wow how dumb do i sound i don't know what a sultan is somebody in charge of something you know but yet i have like a [ __ ] sultan with a boner on the [ __ ] on the disney channel and [ __ ] and that's like the artist thing they think that's funny and then every time they see [ __ ] the movie sultan with a boner they seize every time they see a movie aladdin they see a sultan with a boner anyway definitely said sultan with a boner way too much ohohohohohohohohoh that was what one of the apes did dude watch the new apes movie and it's doing that and then i also saw a thor no not ragnarok that's the new one i saw thor whatever the [ __ ] it was the dark ages or some [ __ ] it's probably called thor the dark ages because why not but i like that chris hemsworth and then i saw wonder woman i can't watch like real movies on the plane like i try but it's just like they're never as good as they are when you can so i got to. watch like [ __ ] action [ __ ] i gotta watch it works like oh mmhmm and so whatever i have [ __ ] two shows left in melbourne and then five in sydney which i had no idea but that's way too many and then brisbane and then home and ohio then
