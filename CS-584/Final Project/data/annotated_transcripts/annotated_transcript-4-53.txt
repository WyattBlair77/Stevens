um anyway wow we went to. uh joshua tree uh this. past week uh wifey was. like let's just get out let's let's let's go. you know she wanted just let's go. let's [ __ ] let's just pick up. and leave i was like where are we gonna go. it's [ __ ] half the world. thinks that you're gonna die. if they cough on you and like you know. the other half is mad. and she's like let's just rent a place. in joshua tree and i'm like what's and i'm like first of all dude. i'm like hold up. what's joshua tree because i know i've been in la. for [ __ ] 20 eight years. and i've heard this joshua. tree [ __ ] i've heard about joshua tree now. i i want to. tell you right off the bat. i don't like the name. joshua tree okay because it's a place it's not a tree and the name joshua [ __ ] sucks okay and and you know that and even joshua's are listening right now and they're like well he does raise. a point dude the name joshua. first of all the name josh. isn't great okay but it's way. better and if you're a [ __ ] cop. if you're josh and you're like well but it's joshua. you're a [ __ ] [ __ ] you know what i'm talking about you're the guy who holds the [ __ ] wine like this where you're like just hold it like that [ __ ] and uh like you're much closer to. where the [ __ ] ascot than any any other [ __ ] and um uh [ __ ] dude one time we were doing an acting exercise in high school. and my buddy jason he he we pushed. him into a closet. and it was on stage. and he [ __ ] came out of the closet. with a [ __ ] pink boa on and he and and i cried laughing and that story has [ __ ] nothing to. do with any of this. but i don't give a [ __ ] dude. what's it matter i'm unraveling and so uh so so [ __ ] we were in joshua. tree and the [ __ ] we brought cali and we and we brought two friends didn't even look at them. in their eyes the whole [ __ ] time but but calvin we we picked up when we left we went to. joshua tree and i was like why the [ __ ] is it called joshua tree and it's because it's at the elevation where the the the these certain trees grow only in the this elevation of where joshua tree is and these trees look like [ __ ] they don't look good and people are always like oh how cool that the trees only grow in this elevation and you can't get them at other elevations and it's like yeah but the trees [ __ ] suck you know what i'm talking about they don't look like nice spruce trees or like christmas. trees they're all they look. like [ __ ] do you know what they look like the they uh like [ __ ] up like um marionettes is what they look like like the [ __ ] when in sync did the bye bye bye video or if it was backstreet boys. i don't know who it. is but um and they are all like got like [ __ ] coming out of it. like they look like maybe they're like cactuses or something. or cacti cactuses i don't want. to say cacti and so um but they're ugly. ass [ __ ] trees and the reason. why they're called joshua trees. is because the mormon. joshua was like the one who discovered it or something okay. so the place is called joshua. tree and everybody goes and if you go you it's like 85 to. 90 chance you'll take mushrooms. and the and and uh yeah and so and one of the and we went there. we played games and we didn't. really have a [ __ ] room to. put calvin in there were five. bedrooms but two of them. were over in another [ __ ] place outside of the house. it was like a casitas that they called. it or some [ __ ] to. make it sound nice and we're like we're not gonna put [ __ ] calvin alone in a casitas like he's some [ __ ] pimp and so we put him in they had a big closet and we just [ __ ] he slept in the bigass closet and like we had his [ __ ] nan it all hunched over watching him sleep in his bigass closet with the air purifier and the [ __ ] sound thing to. there were so many gadgets in there he he was he he was like the guy in the movie. of the enemy of the state. with will smith that's like on the computer. with all the [ __ ] gadgets and [ __ ] just that's the guy that's just like i'm way ahead of you that's who my my son was at joshua tree. and we were with people and and some of the people did mushrooms. and and and it was so funny. because we we couldn't like we were like you're not. you're not it doesn't seem like you're on. mushrooms and and one of the guys. was like yeah no it's not affecting. me oh [ __ ] he goes he says yeah it's not really affecting me it's not really affecting me and he he says it's not really affecting me and looks at his hand. and says oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] sew on mushrooms. honestly it's not affecting me. what the [ __ ] how many fingers is that yeah it's not really affecting me. did you guys put this planter's peanut. guy on my hand trippy man. the [ __ ] he's got no [ __ ] um does the players peanut guy wear [ __ ] pants that's [ __ ] dude come on get with it companies get with the times dude you gotta [ __ ] put pants on the planter's peanut guy put pants on the planets being the scenic um any [ __ ] stays drinking lacroix even at night dude i'm disrespecting uh dude my son does the highest burps it's crazy dude it's like the [ __ ] it's like the michael jackson of burping he just goes he'll just be chilling i'll go um it's cute. as [ __ ] though man um yeah so we went to. joshua tree it was cool. some of us did mushrooms. not me and then uh we went to. walk around and it was too. windy and we came back oh and we went to. a [ __ ] place where it was like dude it's like it's one of those places where like the charm the charm though if you're talking about the charm of a place the place [ __ ] sucks you know have the place be all nice if it's charming it's just dirty and a lot of brown is around uh so we went in and we were like it's one of the we went into. one of these stores and it had like everything. that the person collected within. the past 100 years. you know one of those stores where they're just like. ah that let me tell you about. and you're just like no you're just like let me. get the thing with the three bears. on it because it's [ __ ] it's cute. because there's a little bear and the two and the couple bearing it's like gonna be me. and kristen and then the calvin is the little bear. ah well let me tell you you know. the first the the i i originally. when i first got here it. wasn't because it was because i was i was going. to get a surgery. but what happened was instead. of the instead of that i came here. and i got a deep healing. and a healing and a [ __ ] healing so much healing. is going on in [ __ ] joshua tree. that it's like you'd think there'd be no. disease and and and the more a person talks. about healing the more they wear [ __ ] maroon and brown. and [ __ ] and like tan. and like aquamarine you know. what i'm talking about and she was. just like the healing and the healing. and i found my husband and the healing. and the healing i found my husband. and then so the three bears. in the and i'm just sitting there dude. with my [ __ ] mask on. and and kristen's got her mask. on and the only people with no masks. is calvin and the [ __ ] lady that's talking about healing. and i'm like this [ __ ] chick better. not have covet dude. healing and the healing and as she's saying. the ancient healing healing and the healing. in the [ __ ] like the old cartoons with the [ __ ] smoke. we would go in for like the steak. would be smelling up to. up to daffy duck. and it would just like lure. him in and daffy would be like and then healing and the healing. and that's the coveted to. my son and my son just is like we better stay. here so he [ __ ] gets some healing but like and she and and and kristen is so nice dude. she's just like the nicest person. and now like i got to. be nice because god forbid i'm not. nice and somebody catches it. and [ __ ] puts it on the on the internet. say the [ __ ] nara dude. oh and he's a dick. and uh and uh oh she was talking about healing. and the [ __ ] love of her life and how she got a three a a [ __ ] statue of three bronze bears and he's wrong and he rolled his eyes. really and he rolled his eyes. really i don't think so and so uh so kristen is so nice. to it and she's just like really isn't that. really isn't that interesting really i'm so glad. we just picked up and just came to. joshua tree really oh wow yeah see so that's funny. because and she's just making [ __ ] up. that isn't even but because you know. his parents they were both they met. at war so we get it. she's just making [ __ ] up so the lady. feels comfortable and so i [ __ ] so we

six teeth he's smiling i'm like this motherfucker's dexter he looks at me he just goes this [ __ ] guy stuck me and he's laughing at his dad dude and it was in that moment where i realized dude like if my son grew up and killed me i'd [ __ ] be i'd i'd i'd i'd [ __ ] be i'd be worried that he was gonna get caught dude and i almost cried when i said it oh i almost cried when i said it okay that's all that's all good dude but when you're a dad emotion comes [ __ ] it's right at your face dude it's right at your [ __ ] face man you know how emotions like in your belly sometimes and you're like huh i [ __ ] caught me off guard here it comes it's rising but then the emotion as a man it gets to. your throat sometimes and then it's like i'm just teasing. you dude i'm just teasing. you i'll go back down. your tummy and i'll [ __ ] and we'll just we'll chill a little bit and maybe at a wedding. we might rise back. up or a funeral. we might rise up. sometimes we get here dude. sometimes you get here sometimes. when the emotion gets right. in your [ __ ] like that old commercial like that old [ __ ] what was that sizzler. commercial it gets you here it. gets you right here dude. there used to. be a [ __ ] commercial for like sizzler or like steak. sauce a1 steak sauce was. what it was and he would go and and and in the commercial. they would cut to. a guy and he says it gets you here it. gets you right here that's where the [ __ ] emotion goes. it gets you here it gets. you right here as a man. but when you're a father and a new father. at that the emotion says [ __ ] it and there it's right. behind your face dude. it's right behind your face. so you do [ __ ] like you almost cry. when your son grabs the bell. and you're like oh this. is the first [ __ ] toy i'm gonna buy him this is the first toy that he picked out at this. [ __ ] classic toy shop. and he's just upside down dinging it. and i'm paying for it. and the guy's like can i get can i get get your card. and i and i go to. pay for it and i [ __ ] and i feel the emotion break. through right at my eyes. because of i'm a new dad. and because all of the [ __ ] that i'm going through. also though and uh and i'm thinking this is the first thing. i'm buying my son and i'm [ __ ] getting emotional right. now talking about it but it's not quite. at my face it gets you here. it gets you right here at. this moment so i'm all good. baby i'm all good but yeah. man um and i know what you guys. want me to. talk about i know what you guys. want me to. talk about because it was a [ __ ] you talked about you know i talked about it last time the [ __ ] i can update you guys about the about the depends thing depends part two a lot of you guys were really asking me in my [ __ ] in my dms and [ __ ] uh about how cuz i commented on the depends social media uh i think i did the this emoji or something or fire emoji or something and uh a lot of you know first of all why the [ __ ] does depends have a social media presence who's following adult diapers okay that's very weird that's very weird that depends has a thousand three hundred and three followers on instagram on instagram it's not even just like on twitter i would get it because it's like if you need depends and you wanna deal at least a tweet like hey you can get depends twenty percent off [ __ ] here but who the [ __ ] wants to. see pictures of adult diapers like what kind of weird. [ __ ] so but they have a hundred a thousand three hundred followers on instagram and now your boy's one of them because i'm involved with them because i wear them at night and i did it i did it a few nights now i last time i told you i went against my body because i was going to. wear the depends and i didn't want to. have to get up. to piss at night. but instead i because of that since like you can't. stop the pee you know. there's no cork that you can put in the tip. of your penis so i got the depends and i put the depends on and i'm like i win. body i ain't getting. up for you i trumped. my body right so i did it. a few nights and every night i pissed. all over the bed okay. every night and that's three of them. there was piss all over my sheets. okay not a little if you were a guy and you were going. to be like well chris did. the diaper get most of it i'd have to. be like well half and half. i don't piss a little either. i piss a lot like kristen will go tt. she'll be like i gotta go. and already she's back i'm like what. when i go piss it's as long as some people shits. like for real i'm not [ __ ] around. dude i go piss for a long. time and i was like depends let's see what. you got guess what you got not much. i did it once when i was 30. and this [ __ ] was awesome. i don't know what the [ __ ] dude. by the way i was talking i was telling this. to my therapist i don't you know. and she was like well dude. you uh it's gonna be really hard. to pee in bed. and i was like why and she's like well because you don't you. don't do that ever and it's gonna be like a mind.

[ __ ] all that i'm a spike fish. you know what i'm talking. about it's bit [ __ ] but my point. is they didn't stop at bumblebee they. went to [ __ ] that big ass. wasp i think it's called. like the whatever it is dude. it's like that big it's as big. as a [ __ ] car key. and they and they they boom. they don't stop at that they go. to lionfish boom the guy. goes he touch he hits. the [ __ ] top of the lionfish with the boom. boom it hurts didn't stop there. went to the [ __ ] fire. ants or the harvest. ants and did he [ __ ] do one oh let's get the forest let's get the harvest. in let's put it on there. boom no they didn't do. that they put a [ __ ] bucket. full of fire ants harvest. ants and the guy said i'm gonna stick. my hand in there and i'm gonna [ __ ] keep it in there for as long as i can he gave it his all so i'm watching the show. and i'm like all right you know what i'm gonna watch the whole. [ __ ] thing dude i'm gonna watch the whole thing. because these guys gave it their [ __ ] all and i'm like i watched. six episodes last night and i'm not stopping dude. you give me your all. i give you all i'll watch. the whole [ __ ] thing this is real life [ __ ] dude these guys oh you thought they stopped at harvest ants dude. they do snakes you thought they stopped at snakes. they do [ __ ] komodo dragons. dude this is a real [ __ ] thing i'm telling you they go and they get a komodo dragon. and they stick their arm out. and the guy's like fire. away and the komodo dragon. just goes chomp and the guy. goes oh it hurts oh no. [ __ ] dude and it's st. dude you know the chomping. power that a [ __ ] komodo dragon. has you know what it. is a lot and this dude. the dude the komodo dragon. dude [ __ ] chomped on his arm. and didn't for dude for 11. minutes 11 [ __ ] minutes and the guy's standing there. with a komodo dragon. on his arm for. 11 [ __ ] minutes this thing's a beast. dude they grow to. be seven feet that's as tall. as shack it's like the [ __ ] yumming of the animal. kingdom on this guy's arm and just. chilling arms down it doesn't even it doesn't need anything else it's it's holding onto. his forearm arms down like an archangel that. took flight just chilling. just hold and the guys oh it hurts. how do we get it. off the guys no it it. waits they waited till everybody. died and then the [ __ ] komodo dragon died. and they stopped filming no but then they ranked. the [ __ ] pain there was a dent in the [ __ ] guy's arm there was a dent in the guy's arm they went all in so that's what my [ __ ] point is go all in dude that's why i don't play video games i can't go all in i dick around okay i'm done dude but i did i tell you what man when all this [ __ ] went down when i had nothing to. do um kristen and i were like let's get video games. so we we did well i was like i never really like video. games but let's try and play. video games we got this. game that we both agreed. on we can't agree. on a video game because i want to. play the ones where you. [ __ ] shoot people's faces off and she wants to. play the ones that are about like flowers. jumping on top of buildings. or some [ __ ] no let's play plants. versus zombies and i'm like oh for [ __ ] sake. you know and um so we got the uh this. game we finally figured out. a game that we agreed. on because we googled them. all and it was this. game called a way out and it's a game where you're in jail. and you have to. help each other break out. and then help each other. find the guy that put you there. and then at the end of the game. spoiler alert well before i even. get to the spoiler alert. it's a [ __ ] cool game it's it's kind of like one of those games. that i don't like because you really just have to. hit the button when they say hit the button it's like that's why. i don't like guitar hero. because it's you just you're not you're not shredding. you know and people are like it's like you're just hitting the buttons when you see. hit the button thing like the games. like street fighter aren't like that. you do the [ __ ] you hit whatever you want to. hit whenever you want to. hit it call of duty. you shoot whoever you want you. go around wherever you want to. but this game was like it was like oh [ __ ] remove the crate from the from the door. and you got to. walk up and it says hit x and you're just like and the guy's like oh it's kind of heavy. you know great walk through. the door hit l to. unlock door and you're just like and just because the graphics. are so good and the guy's nose. looks real you're like whoa. you know um but i'm just like you're just hitting but these people are telling me. to hit [ __ ] buttons and i'm just doing it like a [ __ ] lab rat you know anyway it was fun though to play it with her because it was like a bonding thing through this really emotional time in our lives and we thought it was just gonna be like a run and gunnam [ __ ] help each other out hey [ __ ] you drive i'll shoot the guys behind us kind of game you know and those parts were very far in few and far in between but it was like we started getting invested in the storyline and [ __ ] we were like oh that's who did it okay cool well you go into that house while i talk to his wife and see what the [ __ ] see what happened and then it would split screen and like i'd be like kind of sneaking my eyes over at her thing but really i'd be like [ __ ] doing my business and like moving clothes over so i can get some documents ah what move close box hit box retrieve back document r two and i'm just like you talking to his wife she's like i have to read the subtitles and i'm like i got the documents i'll just chill and meet you back near the motorcycle and then so we're like invested not only in the game but like we're with each other on the couch and we're forgetting all of the [ __ ] pain not all of it because it's right there and it was hard you know to deal with and it is hard to deal with but we're we've got something that we're focusing on instead of you know and at the end of the game spoiler alert you find out that you have to [music] kill each other and we've played this whole game bonding and becoming closer as the characters and as the people on the couch that we are and now it's like kill each other hit x and i'm like dude and i look at her and she's like wha what and i'm like we have to we have to kill each other and she says with the straightest face and i'm not lying to you i'm not trying to make this funny but tears well up in her eyes and she looks at me not the character looking at the character she looks at me on the couch and she says i can't do it and i say it's just a game and the tears fall. down her cheeks not. lying for humor this is. true and she says i'm not gonna [ __ ] kill you and i'm like well just no now i'm trying to. make her feel better about. this [ __ ] [ __ ] ass game and i'm like why don't you just how about this you take the contr you just put just take the controller i'll put it down and you just you kill me it's fine and she's like i can't [ __ ] kill you i don't even care if it's just a video game it doesn't matter i'm not going to. kill you in video games. just like i want to. kill you in real life. crying hard even the dogs. are like what the [ __ ] is she doing and i'm talking about like and obviously we're cr she's crying. a lot and i'm i was even. starting at tyra because she was crying. but obviously we had our own. [ __ ] going on at that moment. it was six months ago. but i didn't know what the solution. was because i'm like well i'm not gonna [ __ ] kill you if you're not even gonna she put the [ __ ] through the controller down i'm like it's just like shooting somebody with no gun it's like in the wild west it's like that's not there's no respect in that so i'm sitting there with x and i'm like do i have to. i mean i can't do it. pick up your controller and she goes i'm not doing it i knew. she wasn't gonna do it. so i [ __ ] grabbed her controller and i [ __ ] killed my character. and then we both [ __ ] and we both [ __ ] cried together because of [ __ ] goddamn workers at capcom you know what i mean or whatever it is these [ __ ] [ __ ] workers at capcom that are just like [music] putting circuits in the [ __ ] yeah some guy with like well you know it's it's actually it's much more realistic if the shadow's on the left you know because the light source is coming from the other side these [ __ ] guys would just so you know i'm just saying we could have the shadow at where it was but it makes me laugh because it's completely [ __ ] up and and i'm [ __ ] we're sitting here holding each other crying because i took her [ __ ] controller and i killed myself on the [ __ ] thing that they created and they don't even know about it maybe now they do this podcast is pretty big um anyway yeah so we were all in on that game oh i was talking about shaq dude it's just yeah i i don't even know if i had more to. say about that but how long have i been going. by the way how long has it. been 52. we said wow. has it been good i don't even. know okay all right um i don't know anymore. i don't know anymore i don't know. what's good or what's bad. i i don't even know. if i'll ever [ __ ] do stand. up again i'll tell you what when i go. [ __ ] do stand. up i i uh i don't give a [ __ ] i'm gonna bomb. and i hope i [ __ ] bomb. i don't give a [ __ ] i don't give. a [ __ ] i tried to. make your [ __ ] laugh for too long. i'm just gonna go on stage. and i'm gonna [ __ ] dub bomb dude. i will bomb after a guy. that kills i don't care i. don't care i'll go. on after the [ __ ] killer and i'll go on and i'll do a monologue like it's in goddamn. romeo and juliet i don't care. there won't be laughs come see me let's all.

[ __ ] up [ __ ] of like uh what society has made you you know i don't i don't i hate even saying society is so annoying. at this point but like you gotta get to. the point where you're just that. [ __ ] kid getting that shoelace. do you know what i'm talking. about you're just that. 13 month old with your eyes. on [ __ ] daddy shoelace. over in the corner it's not. a toy you don't give a [ __ ] that's what you want. you move your toys and you get that. [ __ ] it's a shame. it's impossible to be that way it. really is as a [ __ ] 30 40 50 year old it's impossible. to be that way. because you have uh you know. you live for other people. but you got to. find the mix at least that's what those. guys are doing when they're letting the [ __ ] wasps sting that man they're zoning in on that shoelace do you understand what i'm saying uh either be like that or be shack and just be like i don't give a [ __ ] i'll just hawk everything i have for he's got 400 million dollars he's still talking to. a [ __ ] cartoon with a big mustache on [ __ ] generals auto. assurance um so i think i'm done. with the pens i don't know it would be fun. i should wear them. out one but i should wear them. on i should wear them. out to see if they worked with just like a little bit of piss. just with my skinny jeans. but really puffy in the [ __ ] on my front like i'm [ __ ] winnie the pooh just [ __ ] fat a fat you know like i got a fat piece of [ __ ] gut um one time when i was in uh college i went to. nyu for a year until i realized that [ __ ] blue blue blue [ __ ] blue [ __ ] i didn't like it i don't like i didn't like college i hated school dude i [ __ ] hated school and uh you don't need to. do school you know you need to. do like up to. like seventh grade and then it's like i gotta do what equation. uh you're like you're [ __ ] 16 and you're like i i i i gotta do i i i'm sorry i gotta do i gotta read. their eyes were watching god. by zora neale hurston why because of what oh cause i'm gonna forget. it in [ __ ] four months why what's it gonna tell me all right. i'm not even mature enough. to know about the [ __ ] life about what it means and uh and so uh i hated school. man you got to. do it up until like seventh grade. my son when he grows up. and he gets to. eighth grade he's like dad. i don't wanna do it. anymore i go like this. don't do it don't do. it but figure out what the [ __ ] you're gonna do in life because i would have been a [ __ ] comedian from jump dude i would have been a comedian from jump i was i'm just sitting in [ __ ] math class trying to. make dumb jokes and getting. grounded for it this is the [ __ ] [ __ ] that i made money on this is my career i'd be in my parents bedroom late at night trying to. make them laugh and they'd be like go. to [ __ ] bed this is the [ __ ] that i [ __ ] know i made a living off of it um but my point is i hated school and i went to. nyu appease my parents because i thought you know what i should [ __ ] give it a shot and i did and i went and i just like it was ending the year was ending and i knew i wasn't going to. go back and my roommate actually. i shouldn't say his name. because i don't want to. [ __ ] i don't even know if he's alive even at this. point but he was a guy who i realized like 12 years. later would tell me all the time. about [ __ ] osama bin laden and how good he was uh i went to. college before 9 11. okay. so this is why the name osama bin. laden didn't ring any bells but this kid who was from i don't know some other country i don't even remember at this point but would tell me multiple times during the year about osama bin laden and how good he was and i would just be like yeah some have been [ __ ] okay i don't know this [ __ ] guy all right whatever but i forgot about it until i remembered it like 12 years later and i was like this [ __ ] my roommate was like worshiping osama bin laden that's the [ __ ] who did oh i'll be [ __ ] damned didn't know and i remember he would just had this attitude of you're a you're a stupid [ __ ] guy you know to. me like i got a room. with you he would laugh at. my jokes sometimes but you're a [ __ ] stupid.
