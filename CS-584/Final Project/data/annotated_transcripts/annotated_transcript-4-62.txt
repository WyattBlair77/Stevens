[ __ ] 9 20. year olds and he could maybe plug one. in them yeah but does that. mean there's a pedophilia ring going. on does that mean. that [ __ ] pizza gate exists in dc no dude. you're just bored and you're sitting down. too much stand up. go for a run you'll realize there's no pizza gate. i mean insane this this [ __ ] notion of we don't really know what's going on first of all let me say this yeah you do and second of all you shouldn't the stuff you don't know is this stuff you shouldn't know now pull your [ __ ] dirty wifebeater down it's too high over your bellybutton because dude if you believe in that [ __ ] you are [ __ ] out to. lunch what are you doing what is that what were you bringing a sandwich oh cuz i'm going. out to lunch. dude you're an insane person. everything that's going on is pretty much. everything that's going on and i don't want to. know with oh you're gonna new let the government know like google. is starting to. track people now because of the kovat 19. and some people are like well they shouldn't track. us that's the government they shouldn't know. what the [ __ ] we're doing at all. times dude okay government i'll write a list for you. about where the [ __ ] i go. i don't give a [ __ ] where'd he go. where am i my house. the comedy store even not in non. covin nineteen related times my [ __ ] where even if i go to. the strip club who gives a [ __ ] you think dude. say you're cheating on your wife and google is tracking. your whereabouts do you think they're gonna alert. your wife man. do you think the government gives a [ __ ] what you do with your dirty. nub just relax and stop sitting go for a [ __ ] job. dude go swimming for [ __ ] sake wash your hair bro pizza date the [ __ ] name of all denied like pizza oh you know cuz joe biden and [ __ ] hillary clinton and they were all oh yeah oh yeah dude oh yeah hillary clinton had a [ __ ] basement. in a pizza shop and was [ __ ] nine year. olds oh yeah the only [ __ ] female that actually [ __ ] nine year olds is the one that ran for [ __ ] president. last time or do. you need to. go swimming which one is it. dude what's more likely hillary. clinton's [ __ ] a nine year old or you need to. get dry or you're too. dry [ __ ] it up it's all good. dude it doesn't it. doesn't matter man you know. it doesn't matter it's all good. but that's the point is that there's not some active. people who think that there's some extra.

right don't want to get into it too much but i kept that blog [ __ ] hot dude i would go bg to go i would get the cobb salad i would [ __ ] hop on over like i was in the children's book and just walk into that coffee bean i'd say hello to an old racist guy and i'd be like when i said myra cano please and that guy was a racist as [ __ ] he's probably dead now but he one time he was on a flip phone saying yes i know he's busy but i'm trying to get in touch with the mayor yes i understand i know but i want to talk to the mayor about what he's doing with all these illegal immigrants okay cool that's what he said so that's how you know this huh coffee bean was hot as [ __ ] but this guy one time a guy came in with a i don't even know what to call that i'm i don't want to be racist but it was a black guy and he was wearing one of those things that just you don't see in america you see him like africa maybe he was african i have heard no idea but one of those things that was just one piece that but all wrapped around it was like trump's hair you know where life starts somewhere but you don't know where but that's what this african guy was wearing just well one piece no pants no shirt one piece that was just wrapping around his [ __ ] his [ __ ] shoulder. his feet you know and he was just floating. in like orca from heman. and he got the thing and the racist. guy the old guy said hey when in roma and i go well. what's this about he says when in roma. and the guy says excuse me sir. yes he says why don't you dress. like us and i go i knew what. was gonna happen i knew that the guy. being talked to is gonna be so peaceful just cuz what. he's wearing people who wear stuff. like that are super peaceful you know. what i'm talking about the more. articles of clothing you have. the less peaceful you are like if you have one. thing [ __ ] wrapped around a toga or if you're wearing nothing you know how peaceful you are beautiful leaf around your [ __ ] but this old guy had on [ __ ] jeans shoes a buttondown a [ __ ] shirt over it and also a briefcase he would bring a briefcase like an oldschool one that looked like a lego like a briefcase not a duffel a briefcase put it on the [ __ ] table open it up like it was the [ __ ] [ __ ] that pulp fiction centered around with the gold inside of it and he would open it up and i [ __ ] you not dude this guy would pull out nesquik in his briefcase and whenever he got from the [ __ ] bar he would put nesquik in it stir it around put it back in his brief face case close it up all right now here's the thing you know that guy's racist just from the briefcase but this guy came in and the guy goes like this when in roma and he says excuse me sir what he says why don't you dress like us you're far from home this is america and the and the guy said you know what iii should why don't i yeah man maybe i should yeah you know what to. say but then he was like i pray for you sir. and he left and i was like god damn.

[ __ ] and this girl i was eating wafers those those duhs wafers i always said would have these vanilla wafers i love them. do it my mom wouldn't get him. enough you know and i was eating. them and then she was eating. her whatever dessert was. it was dessert time. you know and she was eating. the the wafers and taking the smallest bites. the smallest bites now. we were both small but she was. taking the smallest bites. and i was like looking at her. while i was eating. the food brought a shovel. [ __ ] in my mouth. i don't even use my. hands sometime i just go like this. and i'm like and then move forward. on the [ __ ] table as i chomp it's like that. it's like a conveyor belt at the end. of a horror movie where somebody's like no. no they get smashed in the head. anyway that's my [ __ ] that's how the food's getting into. my mouth i don't [ __ ] there's always gonna be food. people say why do you eat so fast. because i always want the food. in my mouth the second i swallow it. i put more food in my mouth. because the sensation is the best. in the [ __ ] mouth i don't want to. swallow wait a little bit and just suck. on air i want to. [ __ ] eat the [ __ ] and it tastes good and yum yum it tastes [ __ ] good and yum yum it tastes [ __ ] good and then i swallow it and then i put another [ __ ] piece in my mouth because because it's [ __ ] sensation because his [ __ ] sensation and this girl was eating the smallest bites and in my little head i was like i you know how old are you when you go to. pre cairo for i don't know younger i 3 i i was like am i gonna say something to. this girl am i gonna [ __ ] it cuz what what is she doing. she needs to know. that she has to. have more of the food. in her mouth to. hit all the taste. bud and then when she swallows. she needs to put another [ __ ] mouthful in there. so it's at maximum [ __ ] fun capacity in her mouth. understand this is the [ __ ] i was breaking down. as a threeyearold and she's chomping. little [ __ ] nibble ass mouse bites and i look at her and now i can't help. myself cuz i'm like i gotta say some because i got to. know what the [ __ ] she's doing like i know why she's doing it because am i gonna teach her how to. [ __ ] eat like what's the deal she was younger. than me do i remember and i say hey and she says yeah. i thought she was so cute. even as a threeyearold she was. maybe two and i was like ah she's so cute. but she was i was like why. taking such small bite and she [ __ ] looked at me. and she says because then it lasts. longer and i couldn't really argue with that you know if she [ __ ] taught me and i thought i was gonna [ __ ] teach her so the moral the story is a twoyearold can teach a threeyearold something. but i still take [ __ ] monster bites dude. i've never taken a small bite but my point. is i think of that. all the [ __ ] time i think of it all the time i don't know who that girl is i don't remember her. name i think she was mexican. or something maybe puerto. rican because we were on. the east coast but dude. i think about it all the time. i think about it often. when i'm eating while i'm taking my big. ass bites you never know. what's gonna shape you it. could be the nudie magazines it. could be the small bites to. the [ __ ] girl sitting next to. you but that's what makes you who you are. and that's [ __ ] beautiful dude that's [ __ ] beautiful yeah i remember what you said that too i thought oh i'd rather it go quick. and just get the [ __ ] maximum phone capacity. in my mouth because it's more sensational. sensational sensational sensational being a kid. was the [ __ ] man enoch the [ __ ] i guess you get to. relive those moments you know. when you have a kid. i hope so that would be very cool. very nice and very special but what's it. gonna say it's gonna tell you another story about. the [ __ ] this [ __ ] that i don't remember i'll remember for next time but it's funny to. think of the fact that like you know. people who are like people who are like david geffen on. a boat that they had. those moments too and now they're taking pictures. from their helicopter of their boat. telling everybody just stay safe. god wait i know what i actually. want to talk about for the before. i even [ __ ] sign off here. this new meme holy [ __ ] [ __ ] this new meme of the guise of someone doing something deadly and then before they get hurt. or die the [ __ ] guys dance around with a casket have you seen this bro. the remember the meme ladies and gentlemen. we got him the when they got bin. laden and drake would be like yeah i text [ __ ] that fourteenyearold girl all the time and there'd be like ladies and gentlemen. we got him draw. that meme to. me was so funny but i think this one. beats it there's a whole threat. of it that this. guy named dan nolan dude. the guy jumped drives off. a bridge and then these [ __ ] dudes are just first of all who they are they african or what wherever this. is that they're doing this. they take funerals seriously imagine. the [ __ ] body in the casket. they're just like doing this to. the body and the cash is just like bro. you know god these memes do it. they're so funny the one. of my favorite ones is the girt. that got that it's zooming in on a girl's. butt and then it [ __ ] pans over. to the girl guys girlfriend looking at him.
