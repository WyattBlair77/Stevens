[music] so we started i guess. no not i guess you have to. be happy about it i have to. be happy about i guess no look so we got to. hear what was it what 30. minutes ago and we ate burritos and that's great. gonna give a speech you know. what happens when you eat burritos you. get real sluggish after no i don't yes you do i don't because you're human. i don't get sluggish after i eat a [ __ ] brutal. we eat somebody oh so you do what. do you do after you eat a burrito. i get you sit down. i get like static you don't yeah. but in your head but then you sit down. nobody eats a burrito i'm like plays ball. is what i'm saying well that would be a mistake. there we go so you might argue that eating a burrito. makes you lethargic yes got out of that. one so what happens. is you you eat a burrito. and then you start slowing down. it's just what happens. the blood the drug the blood draws to. your tummy and helps you digest. you know why i think that happens. to you because you don't eat you. wait too long to. eat and so when you wait. too long to. eat and then you eat a lot. your your body crashes yes no that's not necessarily true. sometimes i eat as a matter. of fact i ate about two hours. ago so i didn't wait. too long yeah i remember eight. square i told you a squirrel you're eating. too much okay well look i'm eating. fine this isn't what this is about but what i'm saying. is you eat a burrito. and then you don't play ball. right that's so right. so we need to. be bald we're not playing ball no. i know but we need to. bring the ball player. energy to this. podcast to separate it from the other [ __ ] sounds like you're doing good though so i'm holding my weight. because i know i'm on the [ __ ] upswing of the burrito. thing oh you're holding your weight. all right i had [ __ ] two meals in two hours all right. so that's good right. oh so mad so mad cause because you gotta eat. the burrito and then you gotta go. go go go go go go go go go but what you were. doing is like well let's leave the air. on let's leave the place. cool you went to. the bathroom two times because you were not using the bathroom. oops right you were just in there. like toodling and [ __ ] it was hot in here insecure. nelly it was it was hot in. here okay it was hot. in why is it so insecure. to swallow in between. words an audible swallow because you're not. [ __ ] confident in what you're saying it's not necessarily true. which is why i ask the question. yes so that's a that's a yes for me no. and it's why i ask the question. because it's implied in the question. that isn't necessarily an insecure. thing to do to. swallow if you are um if you are saying something very definitive you don't swallow. because you have the next word. to say immediately if you're talking and you're not really i'm sure. what you're gonna say you end. up swallowing and people like that. guy's a [ __ ] i'm not doing anything he said that's why all the greats in history never [ __ ] swallowed in between words martin. luther king jr i know. i shouldn't say hitler's the other guy. next guy who came to. mind i know that's bad but like i'm just saying guys. that have a [ __ ] terrible i know but but they had a lot of people behind them is all i'm saying because they didn't swallow the second anyone's like uh this is why [ __ ] joe biden loses people you're saying and i'm not politically influenced. you're not saying whether they're good. or bad no not good or bad. i'm saying influence all right strength. cult leadership projecting strength. yeah that's why all the preachers. talk like this so you think the reason. they project strength is because they don't swallow. 100 and that's literally the only reason. nope well if you would like to. follow me into the road. i would like to. see that though well so would i but you wouldn't like to. follow that guy no well i wouldn't follow. any preacher or cult leader. which is what you seem to. be doing right there but what i'm saying. is so we need to. have the upswing of the burrito. right and if we have the upswing of the burrito. then we start before we let the lethargic. [ __ ] before the blood all gets drawn to. the tummy so now we're activated. and we're here and we're we're in the ballplayer energy. bringing it to. the podcast i'm feeling honestly. a little bit sluggish right. now that's why because we [ __ ] started too late. it could be so f. so that's what i'm saying. and you were just like dilly. dallying and when we had the [ __ ] upswing and now i've got to. carry the upswing but i'm doing it. mentally not physically because we're starting too late. because i know about the whole [ __ ] upswing it was [ __ ] hot. [laughter] so we wanted it. to [ __ ] cool down because the ac is loudest. [ __ ] [ __ ] in here i understand but what we have to. do is make sure it's it's like the lesser. of two evils right. and it's better to. have a better podcast. and be sweating under the pitch than it. is to i see. right wrong but i still do something. wrong i need to. be hot we need because what do. you sweat let me play ball. yes see you've developed this. thing now where you clap. for yourself thank you and i don't like that. at all i know. i developed it because that's what i do when i because there's no audience. here you know i do a lot. of study stand up right. i do know by the way. speaking of stand up phoenix arizona april 30th. i will be there go. to chrysalia dot com. to get tickets i added. a second show and all the [ __ ] good seats. are full but go in and get that. [ __ ] it's going to. be there april 30th. on saturday so i'll see you guys. there and uh yeah so that's it. no that's rude that's very rude. but you you won't be there. you won't be sluggish as [ __ ] no so you asked one thing before the podcast which would have been a great thing to. ask during the podcast but we started too late. but we can go back. what did i ask you said why. do i wear sunglasses why. do you wear sunglasses sometimes. i think i'm ugly well. you're not always right but i can't. argue with you on that. sometimes i think i'm ugly and i started with the sunglasses. on because sometimes my eyes look bad. but he's going to. admit it dude he's going. to admit it because what because people like what's real. what percent of the time. do you think that you look. ugly enough okay well i mean i think well okay that's a great. question actually thank you um i have my angles. right see you said two answers. neither of which were actual. answers to my question you said. enough and then you said i have my angles. the question was what percent. of the time do you think you're ugly. you tell me dude. i want the percent okay. well a hundred percent though. um no i i um i look i i don't ugly. as a stretch but i look birdlike. sometimes i look gaunt. i look [ __ ] a new color translucent. off death yeah you look really white. do you never outside dude. i was outside earlier. and it's like it didn't even. take dude i was outside. for a while doing pushups. you know me right. yeah i guess i was doing pushups. and situps and doing planks. you know me right. outside yeah yeah and so. i was outside and i was [ __ ] doing all that. stuff i was even doing jumps. and dips out of the pool. you know me right. i do know you stopped asking me. if i know you're right. so i was bulked up. you know what's interesting. about me but the [ __ ] the raise. bounced off me power can i. can be uh remember the guy. uh i can be outside. for five minutes and i get a 10. well. you know yeah okay that's fine. that's fair that's good i'm not. trying to rub it in or anything. but i know but you always have had that. [ __ ] dark [ __ ] like that italian that [ __ ] you you know what i mean yeah that's [ __ ] yeah i mean i love it about about myself yeah i know i i don't like my color. but it's fine dude but also on the king. of this thing in the wing. they [ __ ] have that bright. light on me and [ __ ] so i look even worse. i think they're [ __ ] jealous. dude do you think it's like a frame. job no because they [ __ ] it was like that were already from whatever so you talked yourself out of it i know yeah it was a quick one so um all right so so we you want to. just jump right into. it dude this is lifeline. when i say that it's been like 10. minutes you can't say i want to. jump right so you guys want to. when it's already been like a long. time let's jump right in okay. let's jump right in but but um let's joe. biden we could do. that all right joe biden jump. right in let's joe. bite in the first one. definitely shut the [ __ ] up. wow what's going on there's no person. there there's bloody over here. my roommate has a big. problem where he just drinks. and just gets blacked. out every single day it seems like you're on your way. into a week. so so many chairs i just was making this. video to see if you guys have any advice. on how i should handle it. because i'm going to. be living with this idiot for the next two. years oh oh my that was dude. incredible sign off oh my god signed. on and off with that that the the last. one though was wild. so violent you know. what if you did it. 25 times it was good break. his computer screen you know yeah. yeah first of all too many. chairs okay so many chairs in the back. there yeah second of all was so weird. to hear the guy. but not see the guy that was like i would have said like he's hearing. voices but we heard it. right we heard it uh guy is. absolutely high as [ __ ] while he's doing. it i mean his eyes. were just like this she's trying. to something i don't know. if he was high um yeah he was on he was on something. yeah and so uh he's asking how to. deal with his roommate who's always blacked. out no he's just were you listening or i did i tried listening. he said his roommate's. always sliding down he's about. to get so drunk on weekends. that he blacks out and he said it's turning. into a weekday thing. yeah yeah so that is what i said. no it's not i said you how to. deal with this room when he blacks out. okay yes got out of that. one dude um no so i think that honestly this dude. uh needs to just for real. either get a um you know if he if he's not strong. enough to lift him. [ __ ] power up with your squats. do dead lifts you. know some [ __ ] farmer's carries and whenever the guy passes. out just [ __ ] pick them up and put them in the closet put them in the closet or if you don't want to. do that if you're lazy. piece of [ __ ] which you are right because look at your eyes are half. masked okay which yar then just get a [ __ ] big blanket get a big. [ __ ] weighted blanket and put it over him. wherever he [ __ ] blacks out. and falls down and when he wakes up he'll be sweaty. as [ __ ] and when he gets up he'll be pushing. that weighted blanket off. him and he'll be like oh man. what the [ __ ] and i and then you say and you say well you're [ __ ] sweaty and you'd be like yeah and then you say well that's what you get you're sweaty because you [ __ ] blacked out and i put a weighted blanket on you it's like little [ __ ] you got to. do to ruin their lives. it's not big things this. is the first goto thing. that you think this guy should do you think the first thing. he should do are those two. things that you said i mean. after talk to. him but yeah so so okay so then because i think that's because i think that he probably already. did and also that kind of considered. that's considered talking to. him the guy was in the room. and he was making a video. for us we didn't see. him though i'm a little suspicious. because we didn't see him. we heard it we did hear. it but he looks behind him. and there's nobody there yeah but it was he was just below him. on the couch i feel like he was sitting on top. he was just hiding behind his. ass like this right. um yeah i think well first of all he specifically said two years. of this so it's been two years. two years it's gonna be two years. he's locked into some. kind of lease oh wow. okay or maybe it's college. i don't i don't know get away. to block it the the you gotta for your own. sake i mean yes it's obviously for his wellbeing and his health but for your own. sake you gotta just [ __ ] talk to. him say can we at least. try pulling back on the drinking. because the truth is nobody wants. to [ __ ] black out it's worse. than a hangover dude there's nothing i don't. drink anymore but when i used to. i never really had blackouts. but i did like once. or twice and it is [ __ ] truly scary. you lose time you wake up. and you don't remember what the [ __ ] happened whoa and people will tell you you did this you did that you did that and you're just like i have to. believe you yeah because all of you. are saying this but i have no recollection. of that yeah and it sounds memorable. it's always like a [ __ ] dumb thing wow it's not like you have so much fun with this. it's it's it's that's actually a dark. first thought no no it's not dark. it's fun you put a [ __ ] you he falls asleep blacks. out yeah and then you get i mean. how long do they people. back out for sometimes hours right. well no i think you have a misunderstanding of what. blackout means yeah you you you drink. so much and then you pass. out and then you wake up. the next morning and it's like you've blacked. out your memory there's no memory of it. great right right okay so when you're chilling. you're not passed out you're blacked. out right you're in the future. you will yeah you will have forgotten. right sure yeah okay. so then you just convince the drunk. person who's blacked out. that don't know their blackout. to do a bunch of crazy. [ __ ] like let's go to. the costume store you get [ __ ] samurai outfits. okay you get maybe cat ears. or some [ __ ] okay and then you have a great. time at home you set up. decorations like you bring foliage inside. and then he falls asleep. and you wait in your samurai outfit. and then when he wakes up and he goes what the [ __ ] happened you say i don't know man. and then you try to. figure it out with him. like it's a fun little [ __ ] dinner party that would be fun as [ __ ] cause here's the thing if a guy's gonna be having that much fun and i'm gonna have to. deal with it on the raw. end of it you better. believe i'm gonna be making the best. of it right so i'm the roommate. it's like this guy always blacks. out it sucks i'm gonna be making the best of it. i'm gonna turn lemon into. lemonade and that's honestly what he should do. okay the to me. that doesn't sound that fun the costume. sort of thing but i get as a person who blacked. out get what you're saying you don't have to. do the samurai thing you. can do bunches right. exactly right but i think pick. what based on what i'm getting. is that this guy's not gonna this. guy himself probably likes to. party considering the state of his eyes. i'm sure his hair so i think maybe just say look. i'm here to. help you maybe find a sweet. spot of getting wasted. and having fun but checking like stopping before you pass. the threshold of blacking out like almost make it a game like let's test where the line of blacking out is i don't think so that's not fun though that is not supposed to. be fun got a [ __ ] dream problem. right but you're trying to. make it fun for the guy. like make it a challenge but he's not four. it's like calvin when i told calvin oh calvin. we got to clean. up who can do it. the fastest it is like oh i tricked. him it's an adult. version but not drunk. he's gonna remember this okay. well it's not a literal. onetoone samurai outfits and a way. to blanket okay. those years we figured it out. those are the two different pieces. of advice i suggest you try. mine yeah if you don't. want to have any fun. and be boring about it. so three countries so let's see what's next. hey matt and chris huge fan. of both of your podcasts. max headroom i just wanted to. come on here a little anonymously. to ask for some advice. cool so i know that. you guys are super close. siblings i am also pretty close. to my siblings my sister. is 25 i'm 28 my brother's 35. so our thing. is that we all currently. are living at my parents. house my sister just graduated college. um i'm actually moving out june 1st. and my brother has been here. for a while so my issue. is with him he is 35 he has no aspirations. of moving out of the house. and he doesn't have a fulltime. job even though he has two. degrees um my issue is that the last couple. months i've really seen who he is. as a person and i am not a fan. he is disrespectful to. my parents even though. he's living under their roof. he's incredibly cheap like he'll. venmo request me for three. dollars but if i put everyone's meal on my card. he won't pay me. back because he assumes that since i have a fulltime. job i'm loaded oh. my god and just little things. like if my sister and i go out and he wasn't invited. he'll straight up ask me. well why didn't you invite me. and i'll say oh well you would you wouldn't even. have wanted to do. it and he says oh i would have at least. liked to be invited. so that i could say no. thank you like i think it's the most. respectful thing to. not invite somebody to. something that they don't want to. do am i right. yeah yeah but anyways. struggling with how to. move forward with this. relationship um because it's just really tense in the household. do i have a conversation. where both of us are going. to be uncomfortable i know for a fact he's going. to play victim take everything. personally yeah and then potentially kind of ruin our relationship. because i do love him. i just can't stand him. and if we were friends. we would not be friends. right or do i just ignore. it because there's a foreseeable end. to us living together and just deal. with it or you know. any other solutions because it's just super tense. super stressful on me and at the same. time i think he's kind of tone. deaf to the whole situation. because he just like i said plays victim. and doesn't see how he could do any. wrong ever um thank you. for any and all advice congratulations. on this amazing new podcast. can't wait to. see uh where it goes. all right love you guys. so much thank you thanks. love you too so long. but so long for what is this. soft white underbelly okay go ahead. what's software underbelly oh it's that [ __ ] where they just talk for an hour. and a half um so first and foremost. and there's a lot to. get into there but the first thing. that jumps out at me. what no [ __ ] it was an hour. and a half is if the two options. that as far as you see. them are have a conversation. with them and it'll be uncomfortable. or don't and like sort of like let it. go and see how it happens. if you do option two that [ __ ] is gonna fester in a way that you have no idea what the future. will bring like what happens. when we sit on [ __ ] like that yup when we repress [ __ ] like that is that it comes out. in ways that you a don't. foresee but be in ways. that you really don't want to. behave and i think that even. though option one is so uh unappealing. and gonna be so uncomfortable. yeah you [ __ ] have to. do that because repressing it and sitting on it this is gonna make [ __ ] worse in ways that will surprise you in ways. that are actually worse than even. just living with them as it. is also spin moves help. that you know that okay. i want to. talk to you about something. that's considered an intervention. i don't want the eye. stop giving spin move as your first. piece of advice no it's not but it can help. if you got to. [ __ ] tell something some somebody something very serious about something just go in do a spin start with you like cross though it helps if you're barry sanders is coach. no okay and that's it. no start with your legs cross those what i'm saying. and with your back to. the person and then turn around. and when you [ __ ] your legs even out and you spin around. go not painting the three bucks. and that [ __ ] helps dude that can help. and and furthermore because you're already in a role. but anyway here's what i think okay. first of all she's right. it's respectful for her not. to ask that you're dealing with. two different people that want two. different things and have two different. ideas about uh who each other even are right. so like she she thinks it's respectful. to not ask him. do a thing that he wouldn't go. like i wouldn't invite you to. go to the [ __ ] opera right i would like to. go to the opera. you know what i'm saying though. and obviously i didn't say. that then no but that was a bad. example okay but you know what i had so i wouldn't be the whole world's gonna [ __ ] see this. i don't want the whole world. thinking i don't want to. go to the [ __ ] opera so i do and when i said opera. i was like this [ __ ] weirdo's gonna want to. go to them you shouldn't have said. it then know me. better no but i know. but you'd want to. go to the italian opera. yeah you don't know. what they're saying no i don't need to. no dude they have the [ __ ] subtitles anyway. okay so um so they have subtitles. in an opera it's live they already. got a fat [ __ ] guy come out with tails on just with the cards. of what people there's a big. screen i [ __ ] your wife like on top not in the opera. you know there's a big screen. on top and as you sing. it's like karaoke it's like it. becomes goes from white to. blue that's [ __ ] no it's not i'm saying it sucks that that's like that maybe yeah it does dude you need a fat [ __ ] italian greasy fuckup just walking by being like i stole your tomatoes that's what they're singing. about wow the worst. song ever the worst song ever now. you're [ __ ] you know you'd want to. go see an opera about an italian. guy's stealing tomatoes yeah i mean. yeah you would dude yeah. okay so what was the [ __ ] thing about you. okay so so um i would hey matt. let's go work out i would never invite you. to go work out correct. that's related right and you want. to [ __ ] watch the opera. okay it's because it involves sitting. down anyway i don't want to. watch the up i want to. go to the okay. so so anyway it is respectful. to nothing like one time. remember you and chris were on. my text chain with you guys. talking about game night and i was like what. the [ __ ] are you guys talking about and then you guys said we have a game night. and i said how long has it. been going on and you said two years. and i didn't know about it. for two years and you never invited. me and that was when i realized that. you guys were my closest friends. deeper no no oh oh that's great yeah. right right because you guys know i wouldn't come. to a [ __ ] shitty [ __ ] game night you would never yeah right so i thank you for that what did i do i said thanks guys i really appreciate you know who i am because one time i sat at a coffee shop every single day and there was a guy who was there who was a stunt man he looked like a ferret and he was there every single day and we were talking every day we knew each other this was like for a year and then one time he handed me a book and said you should really check this out and it was a book on buddhism you don't know me dude you don't know me at all was he like evangelist like no he wasn't even a religious guy he was like you know i'm just a stunt man but you should check this book out you haven't been listening to me at all you don't know me that's disrespectful right so that's what you're saying so that's good okay but here's the deal though it's never going to change unless you bring it up it just won't it won't change unless you bring it up but here's the deal you bring it up 99 of the time it's just gonna lead to a rift anyway it's gonna lead to a rift anyway the guy has two degrees but it's really hard and the the pandemic and everything with how tight money is and the coronavirus it [ __ ] everybody up dude dude it'll never not everybody the smartest people book smartest people have the most tactless yeah disrespectful clueless [ __ ] out in the world yeah it's common it's [ __ ] common yeah and and and uh and i have both book smarts and real smarts and you don't you absolutely don't uh and so so the point is it [ __ ] people up i mean we we've all we all have good friends that all of a sudden now just because a [ __ ] the of the coronavirus they think joe biden is a hologram like literally that you could see the trajectory it was like oh [ __ ] okay well oh mass or this or that oh yeah then joe biden's a hologram like it takes [ __ ] eight or nine months yeah but you go from wear this mask to joe biden is a hologram in [ __ ] nine months you can do that dude yeah right it happened it did happen to a bunch of people a bunch of. people that we all know people we know. oh yeah so and and that's fine. if you want to. believe that but it's but you know. the pandemic and the uh and everything. has affected people in such weird ways. that maybe it's just best. to [ __ ] move out yourself do you know what i'm talking about sure. because that's an option then i would actually recommend. that because you don't want to. live with this [ __ ] this guy sounds problematic on a number of levels yeah you should rather not deal with that being said if if the only options are the two options she laid out you gotta talk yeah you gotta [ __ ] talk to. me i have a third option. try and move out. yourself but that's my third option. no spin move you don't. need to spin move you're not. gonna see him you could do. spin move on moving. day you could do a spin move out. of the house yeah yeah okay well good fixing. the world one [ __ ] problem at a time. but talk to him. yeah talk to him. yeah okay next one hi. chris and matt so i'm 23. years old and i'm as i'm growing. i'm trying to identify. ways in which i can be less. of a sucky person in general. so one thing one flaw. that i've been able to. identify uh within myself is that oftentimes you know i just disagree. with people just for the sake of being different. and i i hate that because i know. that it does make sense. and that is not how it should be i mean. being neutral is much better. than just disagreeing for the sake. of this succeeding because that's really not helping anyone. right so and i feel that. you guys do a great. job with that because through your podcast. or comedy or whatever. form that is you guys do a great job. of being not disagreeing just for the sake. of discipline right so uh how would you suggest. uh that you know. i go about stepping. out of this space. that i'm in and just um being someone who is not uh you know. a sucky person okay. first of all [applause] we need more people like that in the world. that is a [ __ ] that guy's 23. and realizing a major [ __ ] flaw. and wanting to change it. that is a bravo. to this guy i can't wait to. talk well no go ahead no you're talking i cannot. wait to talk but go ahead. i think you can wait. to talk and you're and you're buying. time okay the floor. is [ __ ] yours go ahead. go no no i want you. to go okay well because i got the camper baby. boy jesus [ __ ] christ um oh dude. what i'm gonna say is so [ __ ] unreal. go ahead he's he's saying he doesn't want to. be a contrarian for. the sake of it. even though he is i mean. the advice is to. just [ __ ] follow through on what you've already realized about yourself you've done such a good job people are so [ __ ] unaware of themselves. first of all second of all especially when it comes. to their own flaws and dude. you've inspired me whatever. i don't think he said his name. but i'm very pleased to. see there's a 23. year old man in the world. being like i suck. and i want to. [ __ ] change this way that i suck uh as far as how just keep recognizing and realizing okay [ __ ] go you're pissing me off. no no no no i jesus dude. no i hear you i don't mean. to piss i don't mean. to piss you off well. it's too late okay. but here's the thing dude. first of all wearing the most video game. shirt in the world dude. it had a camera a palm. tree and a [ __ ] panda on it for no reason you can get that after you get 40 coins. but dude okay you disagree with people. for no reason so somebody will say something. and then you will just disagree. with them for no reason. you're identifying that as shitty okay. people come up and they say i like apples. and you may like apples. but you go you know. what though apples aren't that good if they're not. ripe and this and that plus. which apples do you like and also have you. ever tried an orange. now that's shitty you're realizing. it but what you don't. realize you're doing is saying something. and then checking yourself and being contrary to. yourself tyler durden dude. this is fight club you're doing what. you're doing out of the people. that yourself just keeping it. fair get a grip dude. you're living in a [ __ ] you're living in your own. world stop what you're doing to. yourself first and then do it to. other people he gets the psyche. oh my god dude it's unbelievable. the guy's doing it to. himself dude but yeah okay yeah a way. in a way yeah don't show. me the back of your head. it's so [ __ ] disrespectful tyler durden took. a whole a minute [ __ ] minute. and got so sweaty you know. i'm so sweet yeah for sure. for sure uh i still think bravo. to this guy he might be like overthinking. it and i get that i can. [ __ ] you know what i fully identify. with this [ __ ] i have experienced. all the things that he's saying what. i haven't experienced is that the entire time. he couldn't think of the [ __ ] word which is contrarian. he kept just saying sucky person. that's the 23andme yeah yeah for real. but but i gotta say still bravissimo to. this [ __ ] because it's true honestly also those people do suck now here's the thing though and i feel strongly about this because i've been told that i've been called a contrarian in my life just because you have strong opinions about [ __ ] that don't align with the person. you're talking to doesn't make you a contrarian. so that's number one you might you can naturally. be disagreeing with a lot. of people but just because you're opinionated doesn't mean. that you're a contrarian or as you. would say sucky person that. being said if you actually are saying things you don't think just to. disagree with people you're right. in that that is one. of the most annoying [ __ ] things that people do that's horrible. so just it's good don't overkill. it with an over. awareness you're on the right track already it sounds like you'll [ __ ] get there you're still really young i think you're doing it right already he recognized it that's fine i mean you're basically at the point where you shot yourself in the head and you realize you're two people yeah tyler durden at least he recognized he's tired of durden yeah dude hear that song at the end [ __ ] stop yeah building's [ __ ] blowing up you know that song dude good yeah it's good good i love that song actually yeah what is it pi uh it's the pyroxes isn't it pixels yeah the pixels yeah the [ __ ] pixels uh yeah i do a good rendition of it though the pixels yeah yeah they're good at it yeah all right well that's good you're tyler durden um he did good that guy okay chris and matt is the written one chris and matt i had been seeing this guy for the past year. we got along great. he checked off all the boxes. and we met each other's families. all was going well or so i thought up. until recently when he told me he'd quote like to. put things on pause for a while. so he could quote think about some things. and figure things out end quote we haven't spoken since then and i've given him his space but i've never been told that before. so i'm unsure how to. look at this situation should i see. this as a breakup and move on. chris you want to. take this one first yeah. you broke up yeah it. sucks here's the thing that sucks. can you put it back. up the guy's a [ __ ] though the guy. is a [ __ ] little wussy. man worthy boy who you. don't want to. be with anyway because you can't even just say. i don't think this is working. out uh we need to. think about some things and figure things out this. is [ __ ] because it sounds like he's already done that and not letting you in on the fact that he has done that yeah he's like disallowing you from being where he's at he's not up front he's a [ __ ] this is this is a week the week week week thing to. do and this is not a guy. you want to. be with yeah no he's being a [ __ ] about it he wants to. make sure that he can get over. you before you can get over. him because when he's over you then. you start dating other. people and you're out of that. zone for of taking space and he won't feel bad. about you [ __ ] doing the horizontal. mambo with some other guy. right yeah maybe that or he's just afraid to. tell you what he actually. [ __ ] thinks and that is almost as annoying. as when he opened the [ __ ] candidates no dude [ __ ] open the [ __ ] thing right when i was driving the point yeah that was a bad time to. do it i get mad. at him a lot. for that about time to. do it but dude. so the point is yeah the guy is either. a [ __ ] or a [ __ ] right and in one way he's either a [ __ ] of not telling you because he's afraid of what you'll think or he doesn't want you to. date other guys while he goes. out and [ __ ] doinks other chicks and can do what he wants and play the field and then maybe get someone else to. help him mend his broken heart while you're sitting at home [ __ ] because you're this is what this happens. though this happens you know. what might be good though. just go do the [ __ ] yeah i think he did break. up with you but i think you should call. him out on it. in a way that's like why. can't you just say no. it's over yeah dude no yeah it's over. anyway she might as well point. out how and help. him out in the future. dude he shouldn't be doing this. to people if you're gonna break up with somebody [ __ ] break up with him yeah but you just [ __ ] do you do what you do anyway and you don't even [ __ ] deal with him anymore. he's done he's done. for you yeah i mean sure you're going. to do sure go [ __ ] for real sucks and dicks and late late lay flat. i will say though. i'm sorry that it does. this sucks yeah it does suck. but it's but it's also a good thing. because he's helping you figure out. that you don't want to. be and so are we we're helping you move. on you got to. move on and [ __ ] lay flat. for some dudes he did you a favor. yep that sounds like boring. sex though what if she wants to. get up and get crazy. boring sex is the best sex. well not the word boring. is in boring sex how could it be good if it's boring. okay because you can literally do. what you want in your mind. if it's boring you can't if all these [ __ ] bells and whistles are going like it's what people say. like tie me up. how about like with me. how about instead of doing what. you want in your mind. you do what you want. period are books better than the movies are books. better a lot of people say. books are better than the movies depends on the book. in the movie right. but i'm saying well okay but if the book. was first the book is better. most not always the godfather. is a great example. of that being wrong okay. that's name another uh the book. it was a good book. they wrote that after the movie. though um all right so i'm saying like i like to. when i like to. do when i like to. have sex no music. okay right because i like to. do the i like to. feel what's in my head. much like driving i drive. to no music okay right. i want to. feel what i feel okay. 4 30 in the daytime. doing the horizontal mambo with you. know my fiancee we have a good. time no extra [ __ ] you know what. i mean lingerie is for the birds. it's just me it's just yeah. so anyway uh anyway that guy. [ __ ] sucks he did you a favor. even though he didn't mean. to so he doesn't get credit. for that but take it and run. with it [ __ ] that guy date somebody who when he breaks. up with you let's hope he doesn't but when he does. he has the [ __ ] courage. to just be like you know. what i don't think this is working. out yeah it's so it's not even. that [ __ ] hard guy [ __ ] that guy it's hard i guess it is but then it's over yeah but it's better. than drawing it out like. this then you got to. see your [ __ ] doink and other dudes and [ __ ] pictures of like stor you know some somebody's on her story and it's like a guy's arm and you're like who's that why don't you just not follow her because he's who he is he's gonna well [ __ ] him we're not worried about him we're worried about her poor dude i'm just saying we're worried about her all right okay hey guys everybody knows it's okay to. have a different colorways. in shoes but is it. okay to have different. colorways in clothes because in norway. it's always cold so don't mind. drugs so i got this gray. one i got a black one and just in case. i got a brand new of the black one. wow um so different colorways. and clothes is it okay. or do you look like you always wearing. the same clothes all the time. thank you guys wow that. guy's [ __ ] cute as [ __ ] clear up the clear. up what he was asking because oh yeah. yeah okay so uh colorways. is like different colors of. different uh of the same. [ __ ] like if i have these shoes i have the gold colorway and also a different colorway why is it why are you saying colorway it's stupid as [ __ ] it should just be different color. it's the term when it comes to. like clothing and [ __ ] it's like so it's not a brand no okay so i have this in the red colorway. and also the green colorway. and also the yellow colorway. it's from abc it's from advisory board. crystal oh i'm not liking. this i don't like it. either but when i learned. it i i was annoying. and then i and then it kind of was like okay. so this is what you got to. do because it's the one. thing where it's like were you. gonna not say it i got the different. colors of this then you just sound like a [ __ ] idiot or a contrarian or a sucky person. a sucky person right and so it's like you just gotta [ __ ] if you can't beat them join them it's one of those things so anyway what he's saying is a lot of people have different colored shoes. you know me i come in. with the [ __ ] yellow shits. and then the next day. i'll come in with the same. [ __ ] but the red shirts right. yeah yeah yeah and so that's a colorway. so what what he's asking is. is okay what first of all. why is everybody in this. [ __ ] episode dressing like a goddamn video game. but he's got the gray. shirt with the camouflage and then he's got the same. shirt in black with the camouflage is. that okay to. do with everything besides shoes. is what he's asking no. okay right yeah and of course the whole. thing is do what you want. to do but he's going. to get made fun of people. are going to. be like didn't you wear that yesterday. you're going to have to. be like no i actually wear the [ __ ] the other one's more gray. and that's annoying but i think also the whole point. is it doesn't matter because you're in norway. you know what i mean. if you're in norway you can. kind of wear whatever you want. you ever seen a norwegian. out on the streets dude. you ever meet a norwegian. they don't have [ __ ] signs. i am from norway exactly. but you can tell who they are. by the way they dress. they'll wear like a [ __ ] bright. orange shirt that's true but not. like a cool one like a [ __ ] like where did you get this. shirt from like is it. in one of those circular. racks in rite aid like they wear those type shits. and like really high short. shorts and [ __ ] backpacks that are like high up. and you're like that guy's [ __ ] obviously norwegian. yeah and he's saying that. this is the kind of guy. that not only would have the bright. orange shirt the bright red. one the bright purple. one the bright [ __ ] green one and different high color. backpacks and honestly i think it's fine. dude but just know you're gonna have conversations. about it especially if you're in america. and also you're dressing like a video game. i think that the answer is. absolutely you can have the same. shirt in all every single [ __ ] color. and you can only wear that if that's what you want. to do i think anybody that. thinks that that's not a good. thing is that that person is so [ __ ] annoying yeah it's like where where where are they even in the same color. like ernest ernest goes to. jail and just goes to. camp [ __ ] yeah remember he would go through his clothes ronald mcdonald too yeah. yeah yeah mr rogers would. wear the same thing mostly. what are you really i don't. know oh you made that up. uh yeah i kind of did. i just made that up mr. rogers would wear a lot of stuff. that was just like an argyle sweater. or something or like a [ __ ] blue v neck. um and basically that doesn't count. you're the norwegian mr. rogers uh he's norwegian earnest. straight up if you want to. be norwegian artist do. it but yeah dude if they're different colors of course yes hey yvonne hey vaughn we scout. stupid today yeah [laughter] all right. next hey we're at the beach. today yeah ernest at the beach. huh give me my high backpack. sexiest man alive so sexy. we gotta start it. over we gotta start over. he's too sexy we've gotta turn around. wow worst camera [ __ ] up all right. hey uh chrissy and uh. matt so i have a question. so my friend uh lids. or my girlfriend friend girl there she does not like uh the long hair. i asked it for my hair. long is better long down. she doesn't know herself and she said i should cut it. she doesn't know herself i like it down. i like it up. whatever but it's been running. over since covid what do. you guys think and if i should either. cut it is it bad for like relationships. or what you're just taking on. a long hair in general. i mean i'm a tall. five seven you know. all five seven so it. makes me i don't know. what you think about that. or what did they put all the variables. together and you tell me i mean. dude five a seven. dude five seven you can't. beat a tall or short. five seven you can only be a five seven. a short five seven. there's only a short five. seven oh so the bottom of his hair. is [ __ ] three 35 that's him dude. remember that [ __ ] of course rico. suave dude but you're [ __ ] shorter that's how he talks his hair literally drags on the ground dude he's [ __ ] orco no no no what was the [ __ ] cousin it from uh what's it called adam's family dude adam's family dude hey man oh my god first of all this is a travesty okay i thought you were six foot two hey guy grow okay you're six foot you're not six foot two you're five foot seven. i would say if you were six foot two. she doesn't know herself and here's the deal. she likes the contrarian aka. what sucky person in you because you're the guy. who does what she doesn't. want which is grow your hair. long when she says she likes it. not long because that's what's sexy. but all bets are off the table because of what if i've seven. okay every guy who's five. seven should have short. hair period it's like wearing a [ __ ] lawn crunch coat you. don't do that you're five. seconds you look shorter. you gotta cut your hair oh i see. okay well first of all i disagree. with oh just top to. bottom everything you're saying no way. dude but i agree that he should cut it. and here's why you he said that's his girlfriend. right he said friend. girl he did not say girlfriend. he said friend girl which made me think that. maybe they're just [ __ ] doinking. okay but she's a cutie though. they're both cuties i think that oh he's [ __ ] i didn't see her really but he's super sexy. he's five seven but yeah. well okay anyway that's very bad. he should cut his hair because his partner. likes it better when his hair's. short it's as simple as that yeah it's as simple. as that you're gonna hurt. your neck no you do. what you want and the partner. likes you you're you're breaking. down the different things of him. the partner likes him. he is a guy that goes. but i have long hair. though and she goes all. right she doesn't understand. that she doesn't know herself. you have to. dig deep sweetheart know yourself. and know what attracted you. to him in the first place. which was this is a guy. who goes against the norms. even though people who are five seven. should have [ __ ] absolutely short hair right. but she is attracted to. a guy that says [ __ ] that [ __ ] and that's this guy no you can't assume she doesn't know herself she'll know herself she just wants him to. have shorter hair because she thinks he would look better. and she's right dude that hair is awesome. i know but like we said it. like he said he's five. seven it's bad to. be five seven and have long hair. you sweep up a lot. of lint yeah his hair's. dragging on the [ __ ] ground. yeah dude he's gonna [ __ ] wash it. later on there's gonna be pretzels in it and [ __ ] [applause] pretzels i was that [ __ ] 7eleven oh man now sweetie can you hear me my keys are too high now i'm [ __ ] sweating yeah dude me too bro that guy was very cool till he leaked out he was five seven how tall is she [ __ ] 42 what's the thing with height. what's the thing with you. in height i'm six too. i'm a tall drink of water. and thank god because if i wasn't you know. how [ __ ] ugly i'd be if i was five eight holy. [ __ ] [ __ ] but i'm not though my friend always [ __ ] up if you were 5 8 my friend always says well by the way if i was 5 8 i'd be a [ __ ] warlord for real i'd be a dictator no doubt i'd be like a napoleon. thing oh dude 100 like napoleon. was short as [ __ ] right well yeah that's where the whole thing comes i get it dude. i would have they wouldn't even. call it they'd call it a [ __ ] dalia. complex from now on for real. i would be if i was short. enough to be like like what five six. if i was five six. five seven i could maybe eek. out still be a comedian. and be funny five six. or below five five dude. countries are getting taken over for real. i i swear to. god i swear to. god i'd make a new country. you could even birth. me in america like you did. you might have a whole new. country in america and we'd rise up. dude you want to. explain that a little bit. like why because people would have made fun. of me and i'm a tall. drink of water and i always had the [ __ ] gift. of gab yeah sure i agree with you but if i was short. yeah i'd also have to. [ __ ] be bull. i'd be bullied right yeah. growing up in my formative. years even though i was a tall. drink of water if i wasn't possibly. people say [ __ ] you and you're short [ __ ] up i get a group rallying around me and we take them over okay you're saying so that would have led to. you like leading a hostile. takeover of countries eventually. yeah because you were short. i would have started my cult. way earlier and it would have been on and popping. honestly okay can i say something. yeah i'm five seven. yes nice but you don't have. hair so it's kind of better. dude if you had long hair. we'd have to have a word. dude if you had a long. hair like that guy. we'd have to that would be unfucking. believable i mean we'd have to. have i would like him i would like him. more we'd have to. have a simple word with you. dude it would be awful. it would be awful. he's five seven and we love him. dude but he's he's got he's bald. dude yeah if he had long hair. we'd have to have a simple. word with him we'd have to. sit him down and we'd be like dude. he'd be like you got to. cut this [ __ ] man you're five seven. and he and he might fight it. but he'd know it was better. because we [ __ ] love him and we'd [ __ ] coach him into. it remember when he was fighting. getting rid of all of it. everyone does that but that was if you just to. extend this one if you are bald. or balding and it's just going. or it's basically almost gone. you got like the ring or just a little bit. on top a little bit. whatever not that you're like trying. to hide it but like you still want. to hang on to. the the vestiges of what was once. a full head of hair get rid of it. get [ __ ] of it it depends on what kind of [ __ ] bald. uh if you the ring is. honestly dude of it the ring works. for some guys man who's who's it. work for guys who wear tweed. jackets who wears a tweed. jacket guys with the ring. oh that's a circular. face it's like a hand in hand. dude it's like you know if you got the ring you got patches. on your but you got patches. on your elbows the ring works. for you you know what i mean. i mean i think you're thinking of people. like in movies in 1970. if you sit on a desk with one foot on the ground. and one foot up a little bit halfway. down the ring works for you. okay had the ring has like a little ring. sometimes that was an anomaly though. he got rid of it. he's balled his [ __ ] [ __ ] now also we know what's happening he's great. he's got a brain. disease so okay well that's unconnected i think so yeah. no i know so okay. okay head was more exposed is what. i'm saying hi matt and chris. i am a 35 year. old happily married woman i have a question. for you about friendships um basically my whole life. i've had only close friendships with men i haven't really been able. to make and sustain relationships. or friendships with women um i don't know. why i just always felt more. comfortable around men i could. be myself around men there's like less drama i don't know maybe i'm just stereotyping. but i want to. have friends with women and i feel like i'm kind of lacking. that in my life and that female. perspective and stuff so basically. my question is why do you think that. is and what would you suggest. for me and shout out to. calvin because he's the best. oh damn i was gonna [ __ ] do a joke. and that just wore me. right the [ __ ] up and i already missed. the moment it's so sweet. okay well uh you gotta have female. friends i mean i know that chicks only really are friends. for two years and then they up hating. each other right because that's what happens. with all chicks they're like oh my god look at my wifey. and then two years later. you'd be like how's amanda or whoever. and they'll be like that [ __ ] [ __ ] stole my man [ __ ] her i ran her over and you're like what right but the point is you don't want to. be that white guy in the group. of only black friends and you don't have white. friends that guy is just like you know hey what's up. man and trying to. act all like you're [ __ ] like you know like one of the guy i could drink she doesn't seem like one of these girls but like one of these chicks was like i can drink dudes under the table and it's just like dude stop trying to. prove it that way i don't think that's what she's doing. but you gotta start having more friends. than just the one. sex because really what's happening. is you're a woman you got to. [ __ ] love yourself more than that you're a woman you love women so [ __ ] be friends with women you don't want to. be that annoying guy that's like what. the [ __ ] they only hang out with the certain people but here's the thing here's here's where i would if she clearly not doesn't have anything against women what's that that's the thing that i don't know what's happened in her life to. up to this point. is that through whatever. reason happenstance whatever the [ __ ] she's only made good friends who are men i would definitely not suggest making friends with a woman just because she's a woman yeah that's bad you don't want to. do that that's just stupid so i think that just know moving forward. that you are maybe would prefer another female. friend but don't like make it happen. that's asking for trouble that's like when you're looking. for a relationship and you're just like need to. have a partner need to. get in a relationship you just ignore. red flags when you should be absolutely. noticing them and steering clear good. point i think you've probably just made male friends. because you've happened to. make male friends maybe she had a good positive. male figure in her life when she was growing. up right like her dad. maybe her dad was you know. really a great dad. i mean maybe her mom's a great. mom i don't know but maybe you just felt more. connected to. her your dad or whatever. the [ __ ] yeah or or the mailman was really cool or something or maybe what i said you know what i mean maybe it's just what i said no but uh it could be both right. yeah it could be both so so it could be both of what. people will be both said right. it could be right. no that's true so um yeah i don't know. i i think that i mean. she said she wants to. be friends with women she did. yeah if she had like a yeah. exactly i i you know. what ask yourself why right. yeah like why do you want. to be friends with women. is life working out. or why don't you have female. friends if it really is just happenstance [ __ ] it it's not a problem i guess like if there's a reason then yeah look at that but what i've come up what i've come to. learn in this past three minutes. is dude like if your life. is happy and you're chilling. you got a nice cute. dog you're happily married maybe it's just [ __ ] maybe that's it. like i know a guy i know i know i keep bringing it. back to this but i know a white guy. with a bunch of black friends. and that's kind of all he's got he's black friends. and he's happy and everyone's like that. guy only hangs out with black guys and it's like yeah but it's like well what the [ __ ] he's happy. yeah and as a white. guy you feel a little [ __ ] you're like but he's even white he doesn't want to. hang out with me and you're like maybe that has a problem with me. you know what i mean. but it's deeper but you know. what i'm saying deeper. for sure yeah but like um i think usually when this. is the case it's there's actually not a deeper. thing it certainly doesn't seem the case. for this woman she wants female. friends i don't know i don't i don't i actually don't i've heard people with complaints like this before. like why do i have or i've actually heard people. be like i don't trust that. woman she only has guy friends. i don't know what is up. with that i don't know. what the implication is supposed. to be yeah it's weird. to she seems like a totally nice person. she could be a [ __ ] crazy lunatic. before we know but she seems like a sweet. person that doesn't fit the type of what. she's saying do you know. what i mean what is the type like guy. friends [ __ ] these [ __ ] okay well yeah that's the problem right she should say it like that and then we'd get it more but um but the fact that she's saying it the way she's saying it makes me think there actually isn't the problem right right right yes of course yes but um it's also you could also go back to. what i was saying which it's nice. to not have female friends. because if you're a female. with female friend with a female. friend basically what you're doing. is gifting yourself an enemy. in two years so next you're gifting. yourself an enemy in two years. okay last one mmhmm great. what up man what's up. arch criminal i need some advice. on how to. not take things so personally. so the guy sometimes people make comments or joke. um even my friends. and stuff and i can find myself. like becoming uh offended. in my head and thinking of things. like well they shouldn't have said that. because i could say this or whatever. um i just feel like it's an issue. i kind of need to. work on and i feel like you boys. are the people to. come to to. solve this issue so let me know some advice on how to. not take things so personal. peace okay that's a great. question and i love that. he's that he's it cuts. deep aware of of this and and thinking but here's the thing. there's like a fine. line between when it comes. to taking things personally as he's saying it there's a fine line between people attacking you or being shitty. or being mean or actually negging you and just either joking. all in good fun. didn't mean anything by it. and and so i think for the former the things. that fall under that bucket. you can take that [ __ ] personally and and consider either not being friend to. that person not having that. person around whatever the [ __ ] but about the things that i'm assuming he means which are generally they didn't mean any harm. by it yeah they're just [ __ ] around. whatever it is right. yeah uh i think that i don't. know dude i mean i'm i'm not that. bad at this i don't take [ __ ] that personally when i know someone's [ __ ] around i have a uh uh somebody told me a saying um it's something like other people's opinions of me. aren't my business yeah. and that's that kind of like struck. a chord with me. uh because like i mean people say awful. [ __ ] about celebrities online people say awful [ __ ] about me online and like you know i i i it honestly like i know i give this um image of this guy who like nothing bothers me and [ __ ] but like it does dude like it [ __ ] really bothers me you know um and it hurts and it [ __ ] like i get in my head about it and [ __ ] and like so i want to. be like shrug it off uh and and keep moving um which is good advice. but also i get when it really cuts. deep you know because sometimes the same. comment made in a and you're in a different. mood could [ __ ] you up and one day and not the next day. you know so that goes back. to um you know you're 50. of somebody saying something to. you because somebody said something that's 50. of it and then you taking it is. another 50 right you only own. 50 of what you even say. in this world but all you can do is here's something. i do when when that [ __ ] gets to. me whether it's comments in person. that somebody says like um you know. like i remember one. one time one guy came up. to me and he was like hey are you that. guy from that show and i said yeah. i won't say the show. but he was like he's like yeah. that show [ __ ] sucks and um what a guy yeah it was [ __ ] awful and i got mad you know and i realized i was mad. because um it hurt. my [ __ ] feelings dude and i knew he probably didn't even watch the show he was just being an [ __ ] um and back then i don't i did not have the tools that i do now when people say stuff like i mean that something that really has not happened in a very long time but it might happen again and certainly online way worse [ __ ] happens i mean people [ __ ] say i'm gonna cut your [ __ ] head off and [ __ ] it's awful but you know look the the only thing that you can do is when to. for me when something like that. happens i immediately think of the stuff. that i'm grateful for. like because that's that helps. me like i think of like i think of calvin i think of you. i think of you know. my family and the people who i have that are real friends. that support me my fiance. and [ __ ] like that and the fans man. like the people that show up to. my shows and like it just it. helps it helps to. just immediately put yourself into. a different mind state. and that coupled with what somebody else thinks of you. is not your business. um [music] you know you. can get yourself out of some [ __ ] really dark. times i have so you know it. seems like you're doing okay. you do look like a [ __ ] straightup convict yeah it's a straightup art criminal yeah the longsleeve shirt the car here the chains well i think that one thing is that that i've actually for some reason i feel like i stumbled upon this and it's something that i always keep in mind. that has actually really helped me. and it's when someone says something shitty. about you to you they're trying. to upset you and so if someone's trying to. upset you by telling you something about you take that for exactly. what it is they're tooling around. in their head for something to. make you mad don't give them. what they want first of all. and second of all if they're trying. to make you mad they're probably. reaching for it anyway it. might not even be [ __ ] true. they're probably just doing it. to specifically to. upset you and you can't be giving these [ __ ] what they want second of all act like you didn't [ __ ] hear it you'll be surprised at how quickly you [ __ ] forget it it doesn't [ __ ] and then also who the [ __ ] [ __ ] cares what [ __ ] somebody else has to. say about you i don't even care. what that guy's saying if you think it's [ __ ] true. [ __ ] fine but chances are you only think it's true. because somebody some [ __ ] like that has said it to. you then or before [ __ ] that [ __ ] yeah it's too short we're all gonna die. yeah well not i mean not everyone has. died yet but we're all gonna die. though not sure there's still people alive. no they're gonna die jesus. christ don't make that face okay um you could also if somebody says something [ __ ] about you you can just be like nah ah that's you well you could do that and then do it spin move and then [ __ ] um yeah so that's i don't know man i feel you though dude the way he was talking about it made me feel for him like i feel bad you know and i don't know why he's in a [ __ ] makeup trailer but he was and um and it's fine uh and get a different hair style now no way dude the hair was killed it was this [ __ ] but what are we in the [ __ ] 80s dude yeah [ __ ] extra in red dawn no you're not he's owning the arch criminal book he is real true that's true and now that it's 2022. you can kind of get away. with whatever but he is white. so he might want to. [ __ ] change it up. a little bit he looks like an arch. criminal a smooth criminal we like him. don't take it personally. life's too short we're. all going to. [ __ ] die and you know what the person. that said it to. you that is probably that has said something. that it's gonna that you took. offense to you took too. personally it's probably gonna die. a miserable [ __ ] death yeah so don't sweat him. and he might even die. first you can do that. if somebody says something shitty to. you you'd be like man. you probably died before me. moving [ __ ] or moon. walk out dude all right. ill that would be especially with that hair. we're gonna have that's actually true. but we're gonna have an intervention. with you about the spin move thing. because i don't know what's going. on with you but it's all you think about and it's becoming a real. problem it's getting in the way. of our show of the advice. you give okay and pretty soon. it's gonna start leaking into. your actual life you're gonna start. doing spin moves on people i mean. i've done them you've done a spin move in like a football game. i did it once when a guy uh i held the door. open for a guy and then he didn't say. thank you and what'd you. do i did a spin move and i said held it. open for you no yeah. i did really you're my hero. then i mean that's [ __ ] pissed me off yeah well how did you feel after you did it though. uh it was so much. like free emotion and like it. was everything it was freeing. it was rage it was happiness. i mean it was uh unreal. so we've stumbled upon. something one time a spin move is a good. idea next time somebody says something. that you take personal. offense to snap turn your legs. do a [ __ ] spin move and say well i said held it. open for you what should he say. oh him uh you're gonna die. sooner than me yeah spin move. you probably died before me. yeah [laughter] i mean that. would you'd instantly win. that interaction dude i just you leave thinking about that. not what the [ __ ] said to. piss you off yeah right. right right yeah true. yeah that's yeah i literally think i. think that holding a door open. for somebody if somebody doesn't say thank you. or something it's the rudest thing. and it's also harder to. not say something to. somebody than to just be like that. because you're fighting the urge. yeah it's like i'm looking at you. opening the door you're fighting. the urge you look. at me and you fight. the urge to. say something isn't it. crazy and then you just say. nah and you don't do it. you don't say [ __ ] you walk out. isn't it crazy isn't it crazy. there's this neighbor that since i've moved i have i've had this like kind of growing. uh hatred for gone and i try not to. hate him but i just you know. what i just do he listens. and i hope he does. and i walk when i walk my dog. i see him and like i'm a paul simon. song i'm always like weighing whether i should [ __ ] say say hi or whatever because he's such a dick he probably won't say hi back to. me but he's like a car. guy and he's like working on. a car in his garage. oh wow and i happened. to walk by when he was working on it. and i actually said we actually locked eyes. and said hey to. each other so i know he saw me. yeah and i were walking. by and i said oh man. this one's cool i can't wait to. see this one he didn't say. anything yeah yeah that's that's really odd. that's so odd like how yeah i would do so many [ __ ] spin moves yeah. you would have just been spinning down the street. dude caught up with your legs. dude i just don't understand. when somebody you you should have stopped and said i said i can't. wait to see this one. when it's done no. i said you know. what i actually said i said oh just like that. i was walking the whole time. but i said it nice. that's pretty much a spin move. dude i don't understand. that [ __ ] i don't understand. that it's really weird man. it's like don't be actively rude. for no reason yeah you're trying. to make the world worse. when you do that you're trying. trying not just doing it but trying. actively trying to make the world. a worse place interesting you're trying. to make the world a worse. more miserable place than it. already is and let me tell you something. it's bad and miserable as it. is wow yeah it's a dark. yeah and then on such a dark. note but also do you think that they know. they're doing that they're trying. to i think it's their past. i got all caught up. to first of all who is this. guy that lives next to. you he's like a [ __ ] what's that. guy in uh the chris uh who's that actor uh he really feels there's a lot of them. so you gotta narrow. it down [ __ ] the older one cooper chris cooper is like a chris cooper character. yeah he's like chris cooper. and american beauty right. okay guys that's what i'm thinking. of called me out but i mean. many characters like that but okay. sure uh but yeah his his wife's weird. too yeah of course she is. when she walks her dogs. all of which are [ __ ] mean as hell my dog. of course they are my dog's just trotted by all. quiet which she never really is but she is around. these dogs because they're all like going forward. so they talked more than the people. then yeah but then she talks to. her dogs and i can hear her. talking to her dog. all the way down she's like we don't do. that you know be nicer. be nicer and i'm like is she doing. this for me yeah. like does she think she's going. to do it also talk to. your husband say that she wears three masks. outside cough in her. face out [ __ ] side off in her face on a quiet street where there's nobody that's yeah that's unbelievable does the guy do it no well then she's going to. get it anyway if she's going to. get it if he sees. his mouth he's in his [ __ ] house. with his mouth open and she's [ __ ] gonna get it she's not in her. house with three masks on this. is insane dude you can't get covered. outside when you're walking. alone there's wind i talk about this. in my act but like dude. come see me. phoenix april 30th but it's like chrisley dot com but it's like so annoying that [ __ ] people do this they got their priorities are so mixed up she's walking her dog trying to. correct her dog barking. wearing three masks and letting her husband be piece of [ __ ] yeah dude all of these things are backwards. get your priority get. your priorities activated talk. to your husband stop trying to. correct your dogs from barking. and take off at least. absolutely dude it's so [ __ ] whack. people are crazy he also ha. uh he's also not only a car. guy but he's like one of those older guys who like riffs at night. sometimes on his guitar. he's got an amp and everything. this
