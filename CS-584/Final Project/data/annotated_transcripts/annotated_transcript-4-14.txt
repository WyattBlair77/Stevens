[ __ ] that's a little much right. but the second time if you're going for the next. [ __ ] okay because we're a little bit more familiar with each other right. it's a sensitive area. you don't want to. go to that sensitive area. right away right what if they don't like it. so the second time you go for that. scentsy area right and so that's what that's what you're doing. so the neck is a sensitive area. so when i get the [ __ ] neck. tattoo i was like it's gonna hurt. and the guy's like yeah it's gonna hurt. as much that's the thing. about tattoos for those of you who don't have tattoos they hurt. as much as you think that. they would hurt but there's something. that they don't tell you and i'm gonna get into. that okay now this tattoo took about two and a half. hour two two and a half hours. it didn't take that long. i was thought it was gonna take a long. time most of the time it took was him. drawing it out um. um i'll shout out the guy. afterwards but uh so i wanted to. get this 40 with the rose coming through it. right uh there's 40 days between. all of my family's birthdays like it's very weird. and coincidental uh calvin was born. february 18th uh 20. to 18 20. add all that. up together it's it's 40. a lot. of 40 40 was a transformative year. in my life a lot. of things are connected a lot. of connectivity with the number 40. in my life so i was like oh [ __ ] this is gonna be a banging tattoo and i decided to. get it and i'm happy. about it all right. but i wanted to. do that i wanted to. demean something because it's on my [ __ ] neck. right i don't want to. get the goddamn roadrunner or whatever. the [ __ ] my friend when in high school. one time i was in when i was in high school. we were at the ymca working. out and he had a [ __ ] yosemite sam on his ankle and he [ __ ] got and it got like caught in a car accident and yosemite sam was like all jagged and [ __ ] and he was like the only thing that makes a yosemite sam uh tattoo worse is a scar in between his [ __ ] goddamn mustache it looked awful but it was hilarious anyway so i'm sitting down like how much it's gonna hurt and he drew it out it took two hours he drew it out and then it and then i sat down he's like it's gonna hurt you're gonna you know it's gonna hurt as much as you think it does first hour i realized something oh i must be a tough guy it doesn't hurt. at all it's sensitive right. but it doesn't hurt. at all oh i realized oh good thing. i'm getting this neck. tattoo because i'm a tough guy because it doesn't hurt. at all and like these [ __ ] out here say tattoos some people say oh did it hurt. dude this didn't hurt. this didn't hurt i. got one in my chest. it doesn't hurt i have. one right around my anus. i don't but it just doesn't hurt. right an hour in no pain. i'm like oh i guess i'm a tough guy. i always wondered you know. i haven't been in that many fights. or anything like that but i always wondered if i was a tough guy. and right now the first half. of this neck tattoo i'm realizing. oh [ __ ] good thing i'm a tough guy the second hour. of the neck tattoo i'm not gonna lie. it started hurting now i realize it. was because you know the first hour. he was [ __ ] opening it all up and then when he was going over it. he was going over it. again and it was opened all the [ __ ] up and he was just to. the already tender area. so now i'm less of a tough guy. but i'm like i could deal with. it 15 minutes into. the second hour we're about an hour. and 15 minutes in it. it feels annoying but my it wasn't the pain. it was the fact that my body. was like hey get out. of here what are you. doing though my body was going. like this [music] so hey it's really uncomfortable. um [music] it was like a next door. neighbor and the party's too loud it. was just hey just i'm trying to. sleep it's past 10. and honestly your hubba stink. is too loud and if you could just turn it. down i'd appreciate it. that's what my body was doing. imagine that then for 45. minutes dude my body wanted. my body was like what are you. just just get away from what's happening. and it wasn't the pain. it was the amount of uncomfortability my body. was in laying there just having to. sit there and do something that wasn't pleasant. and my legs were twitching. i was breathing heavy and i was like ah it was so [ __ ] annoying. dude and when he finished oops. i leveled up when it. finished oops i leveled up right. i walked into that. parlor a certain amount of sexy. and then when i walked out i was topnotch sexy. whoops i leveled up right. i walked down the street. different now okay your boy's got something. crazy about him

[ __ ] remember the 90s. when you had to. [ __ ] like literally like start a grunge band from the ground. up and it took [ __ ] 15 years before you could start being like oh yeah selling out. a goddamn troubadour now it's just renegade. renegade renegade renegade. all you gotta do is [ __ ] it's unbelievable. dude what i do know. is i made [ __ ] two dollars. on tick tock. today um [music] so that's what's up. oh we're 55 minutes in wow. that really flew by. huh i don't know man. who knows anymore who knows. anymore i'm just [ __ ] dude i went out i got that how many times can postmates [ __ ] up by the way percent of the time i ordered a burrito. they showed up with a [ __ ] empty bag here you go. it just had the sauce. in it i'm like bro. i didn't you don't even. check it too every time i pick. it up i cause i don't. i let them leave i say leave it. outside of the thing sometimes. they still knock on the door. or ring the doorbell it. literally says on my thing baby's asleep. don't ring or knock and they'll. just ding dong and i'm just you know. just leave it out there. [ __ ] and then i show up and it's just like some kleenex and a goddamn some [ __ ] barks root beer and i'm like what the [ __ ] dude and i did no no burrito dude i got a [ __ ] white bean. salad and a burrito. just the white bean salad. show up shows up this is what happens. when [ __ ] are out there dancing a renegade. on ticktock and you get a career. just for looking a certain way. that's the end of civilization when you get a job. because you look a certain way. it's over mod unless you're a model. right actor maybe if you need to. fit the part but like [ __ ] goddamn dude. whatever who cares who who even. knows anymore i gotta go. i gotta go to. the bathroom so bad i think i have to. stop so we can cut this. and i'll have to. come back and finish up because i gotta go. about them so bad. i'm back dude i had to. go to the bathroom. sorry i had to. go potty i'm glad though. because i while i was doing i was going. to the bathroom i remembered this. [ __ ] dude we had my family. over uh like my mom and my dad. and uh they came over to. eat dinner and we had another friend. of ours here and calvin and kristen and i i actually i haven't talked to. my dad about this. yet and i want to. talk to you guys about this. first because i don't even know why. but i think it'll be [ __ ] funny because my dad listens to. this podcast and he's definitely going. to hear this but like so we got pasta. this is a [ __ ] minor thing right. but we got pasta. and uh i got three angel hairs i got spaghetti bolognese for kristen. and i got um a linguine. in a pink sauce for me. pink sauce didn't show up it. was red sauce anyway got pissed. it was maria's italian kitchen. you know the [ __ ] story i told about it. and they didn't [ __ ] do the pink sauce. got pissed but it's all good. i also got two capreses and i got a [ __ ] salmon whatever i got a shitload of food. the most thing that we had though. was the angel hair pasta right. i was like you can't. go wrong with that the people. are going to. like it my family's. italian it's fine my parents. said they didn't care what we were going. to eat so fine. so it all came and i got the [ __ ] [ __ ] uh the ingredient pink sauce for me. they didn't have a pink sauce. and uh it had a red sauce. i was like i just put it in my bowl. and i brought it over. to the thing all this. stuff was on the kitchen. island so i put it in the bowl. i brought it over. to the dining room and i see my dad. with um angel hair pasta okay and then i see kristen bring her. spaghetti with meat sauce over to. her dining room table then i leave to. get up to get a drink the only person. at the dining room table now. is my dad with his angel hair pasta okay i go get the drink. i come back and i notice. in my dad's dish. is angel hair pasta and some spaghetti with meat sauce. right now the only person who had spaghetti with meat sauce. in their bowl was kristin everyone else. had angel hair pasta and i had the linguine. i noticed it and i thought i must have not seen. something right he must have got it. at the kitchen island whatever right. because the only other explanation would be he was at the dining. room table alone and then literally scooped spaghetti. with meat sauce out of kristen's bowl. and put it in his bowl. which is something that just my dad. would never do okay. so now i'm like well [ __ ] maybe my dad you know when people get older they just start doing [ __ ] you know what i mean like old dude old like when people get really old that's when they just start farting and you don't even know if like they meant to. do it or not but you don't even. question it right like like like like a 78. year old man will just be standing in like a tv. room and you're watching tv. and he'll just be like and you'll just like won't even say. anything about it because you're like well they're 78. right but so i'm like my dad's not there. yet that's 73 but maybe he fi. maybe that was the moment. where he was just like oh pasta. and put it in his [ __ ] and we just gotta allow. now we just got to. live by a different a set. of standards for dad right. like oh we never know. we never know what the [ __ ] he's going. to be thinking or doing. or maybe he's going to. be that guy that's just standing in the living. room we're watching the mets play and he's just going. to fart and we're just going. to like not even mention. it so i go to. bed uh that night um i forget. it and then kristen says you know. i think that your dad. took some of my spaghetti with meat. sauce but it was so weird. because he didn't do it. at the kitchen island the island. in the kitchen he did. it already when we had already picked our portions. and i don't know if and she said the exact. same thing i did she was. like i don't know if he did it. because like it he's just old and he just thought. oh whatever or if he or what. and i was like it's so unlike him. to be rude and just be like i want. that boss like and so i haven't asked. him about it but i'm going. to ask him and i'm going. to keep you guys updated. about this because i want to. know if my dad even knows he did. it he's probably not going. to remember and this is all going. to be [ __ ] but i'm going to. tell my mom about it. she's gonna laugh her [ __ ] ass off and i asked my brother. about it i was like dude. does that have dementia. like what's going on and my brother's like maybe he just wanted. it and thought [ __ ] it and i was like man when you put it that way it's less rude and it's just like i don't know i just wanted some but it was just so [ __ ] weird it was weird though to. have that moment of [ __ ] dude. is my dad now just old as [ __ ] he's 73 and he looks you know 67 65. he looks good but like i don't know. i'm gonna ask and then you guys are gonna know. about it next time. i'm you know i should [ __ ] call him. next next next episode and ask him. what the [ __ ] he was doing with the thing. i should call him. now [ __ ] it i'm not gonna put him on the spot like that actually you know what i'm gonna [ __ ] call him now i'm gonna call him now i'm gonna text him now and then see if he uh will pick up i don't wanna uh hi dad i'm doing my podcast and have a question can i call you we can cut it out if you don't want it on okay waiting this should be good uh although he's probably
