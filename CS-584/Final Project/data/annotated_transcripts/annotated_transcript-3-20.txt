[music] dude murray yes are you a dude. yes are you in phoenix scottsdale or tempe. yes is are you gonna kick a dip in the pool. yes this is how people take dips. in the pool when they're in when

so it's unbelievable dude. if you wear a backwards hat in a pole. in the pool you are a you are mighty. that's all i gotta say you are just so. mighty but tempe arizona came out. we love tempe arizona. god that club is awesome. shout out to the tempe. arizona and uh and uh and all the people that work over there. uh love you the staff. was awesome um and the fans. were awesome and we had a good time. dude brent morin came with. me and uh did the shows. it was like a um what do you call. it it was like a reunion man. it used to. open for me 10 years. ago and uh and the dude's great. man it was really cool. it was super fun we went. there and here's what i did. i went to. adam ray's wedding now you might know adam ray because first of all he's in a lot of things as an actor second of all he's got a fan base as a comedian. and third of all he was also in the tour. report uh vlog that i did. for i don't remember where he came oh uh peoria. and rockford and uh adam. ray is one of my best. friends he's a great guy. he got married in um phoenix saturday. last saturday um congratulations. to him and amanda lovely. couple awesome awesome time but what i did. was because i'm smart. dude what i did because i'm smart. was okay now is adam. a comedian yes does he have a lot. of comedians that are going. to be at the at the at the at the wedding. probably okay because he's a comedian. and we're we're involved in that. world so what did i do as soon as i got to. the the the take the ticket. what do you call. the invitation did i book. a room no i booked. shows the two days before it because i wanted to. be the comedian that got the dates. yes is he selfish. or is he just forward. thinking is he selfcentered or is he just thinking about. you know the plan here. and then what he did. to do he waited. too long to. get the hotel room and it was booked and he had to. stay somewhere else dude. somebody first for my babies but also brought the fam brought uh calvin. brought kristen kristen uh aunt lives there aunt lynn and uncle carl and uncle carl laughs like this. um and it's absolutely unbelievable. it was a beautiful time. of friends and family it. was a beautiful time. at the tempe improv it. was a beautiful time. and you know i tell you this. man uh brent was there. david sullivan came there too. you know him from the tour. report in savannah and also just from you. know having andrew jackson here and being in uh you know. being in small town wisconsin. uh i always joke. around about him like i can't. believe [ __ ] 900 people saw a small town wisconsin. but it's actually a [ __ ] great movie and it's uh and it's a killer it's a killer. thing there it's a good. movie and it's doing well and it's making the rounds. on the freaking um what do. you call it the uh the the what. do you call them. the [ __ ] festival circuits we forget. the words festival we forget. the word festival dude. and i'll tell you why i don't know. why but i need to. take ginkgo biloba but i will tell you i don't take the [ __ ] gabapentin anymore. uh because of the word recall and i still can't. remember words like festival and it's [ __ ] amazing. but uh uh uh so we went to. tempe checked in a hotel. stayed in a hotel was a great. time and then we went to. and we did we did the shows. and then we did we went to. adam ray's wedding me and kristen and uh all the other you know people there that were there it. was just a beautiful time. man let me just tell you about how great. and you know i don't know. if this is because i took look i don't take vyvanse that's not my thing. i don't take vyvanse but i happen. to take advantage today and i'm really. got married because i wanted. to make sure to. be there and be present. and you know when your boy takes. vyvanse it's like he might as well. be the captain of a [ __ ] boat i mean. he's just in charge and he's telling people. what to do in a nice. way though right. not in a like hey you do. this way and i like hey why don't we do. this and it won't make the time. that much better and then people go. like that's okay you know. and there's some outliers that are like i don't know. but you know as time. evolves and we keep going then we realize that well the captain was right and it's mostly because of the vivance now um i was at the wedding and it was a great time just beautiful time first jewish uh wedding. i went to. sorry kanye but uh i did. go and it was beautiful. and they crushed the glass and uh adam. hit it first time. immediately and when i went to. eric griffin's glass uh wedding. he didn't get he he [ __ ] it up he didn't get the glass crushing. the first time and i think it's i think it's like a hidden thing. that jews kind of secretly know how to. do it because adam's jewish. and eric is not jewish. so uh and by the way adam. had a completely jewish. wedding like with a rabbi. and he was funny all rabbis are funny. as [ __ ] you know because they secretly want to. be standup comedians and um he was talking. in hebrew like a lot of the time. and for for [ __ ] [ __ ] if i know if he was just bullshitting. you know what i mean. hebrew is one of those languages that i think i could probably speak if i just felt it you know what i mean. like japanese i know i can't. do it i have to. learn spanish it's too close. to english i can't learn. but hebrew they're just like sometimes. i feel like if i just hooked into. hebrew i could just [ __ ] absolutely just fired it out there you know just get one of those scar those tablecloths put them over here and then just put a mini hat on and just died and um so you can hook into. hebrew but um yeah so adam hit that glass and it just crushed it. it was beautiful and amanda looked beautiful. and adam looked great. adam never looked better. adam had his hair nice dude. we didn't know what kind of hair. adam was gonna do he did the nice. hair dude and uh you look great. man i'm just so proud of these mother. colvin really [ __ ] weeded out who was bout. it bout it and who wasn't bout. about it right. like covet really we like when you were in covid. you lived with somebody you. really found out if they were bowed. about it right. you were with somebody you were with them. all of a sudden every day. and you found out if they were bout. it bout it if they weren't about it. or by the way maybe you're not proud about it. and it's okay but you split. up but congrats to. all the people that made it. through covet and found out that your loved one. or your spouse or your girlfriend. or boyfriend or partner. whatever it is was bout. it bout it dude. and let me tell you something. man i'm glad that they're bad. about it because that. wedding was a great time. and i don't know if it's speaking. but so i was at the jewish. wedding and there was like a you know a nineyearold that challenged me. to a danceoff and i realized after he challenged me. to a dance off i i left. and you know i i think i kind of won. the dance off he did one. move over and over again. and had the l on. his forehead saying i was a loser. but i i feel like i kind of won. it because i was doing a little bit more. my moves were more you know. they were versatile my moves. were more i was picking from my bag. of moves and he kind of just had like this. one fortnight dance that he did. fine whatever he thinks he won. and but then i realized that he was dance. battling everybody and i was like. the fifth guy that he dance. battled and he was calling me john. wick because you know i look [ __ ] crazy good in this suit. uh and i got the black tie. and i don't even know. why any year old knows. who the [ __ ] john wick is anyway. because that movie is so violent. right like maybe call me. men in black hey kid you're eight. right it's like he's just like you know. hey look at the character. from sling blade he's like well. that's entirely too grown up. for you to watch. that movie hey you look like the woman. you you look like the the [ __ ] the the husband and woman under the influence. are you talking about a john. because of eddie's movie from the 1970s. and doing a fortnight dance so um anyway i [ __ ] i i honestly. ice that kid with my moods. but i'd let him have it. because he's a kid. he didn't get tired at all. dude he was doing like all sorts. of [ __ ] like i mean his wind is great. when you're eight your wind is. crazy good dude um so like between counting all. of the [ __ ] together i won. the dance you know. my wind isn't as good. as an eightyearold's windows. wind was awesome and he only did one. move and i was picking from the bag. of tricks right so uh anyway that's the other here no there um forgot about the [ __ ] hava nagila. forgot about the hava nagila. dude dude how funny is it. when david alan. greer in uh it just does. it in in living color and he's like have a tortilla dude. i left so hard. forget it i left. so hard the black jewish. dudes doing the holiday one of the funniest men. alive but um yeah so i was so all of a sudden. they go like this hey time. to lift up the couple in chairs and i go. like i'm like homer in the [ __ ] dipping. back into the just hey time to. lift up the the jewish. couple in the church me right. i'm a homer getting back. into the plants. like into the brush because dude. uh uh hey dude i'm not. i'm not dropping anybody and guess. how i'm not dropping. anybody by not picking them. up i pick him up. huge percentage even if there's a little chance i might drop them. that's a bigger chance than. if i'm not picking up. anybody so they go delia. get over here you know. why they did it right. you know why they did it. let's not [ __ ] you know why. they did it i'm broad. i got a tall drink of water. i'm real broad i could. i could lift i could lift [ __ ] up. right but what did i do. though they go there's adam and there's amanda but what did. i do though but i go well. let me just i'll go. to amanda because she's mini right. adam is a man. and i go let's have a chance to. drop in the the you know. the the the petite lady then there is dropping. you know adam and he had like i mean. adam's uh [ __ ] man right. he played wolverine in uh in universal. studios when he was younger. and uh so i'm doing it. with like there's like you know a bunch of people with uh do you know doing the chair. and we lift up a man. and i realized i'm the one. that's holding the back of the uh chair. only me okay i'm holding one of the bottoms of the chairs and then the the and i look and nobody's got their hand on the back. of the chair so i'm crucial. to this mission right. we got [ __ ] like straight up jaleel white and joey mcintyre and me and i'm not that's no joke. they were really them. holding the chairs and then me like this. with the back and i'm the only one and like i know joe mcintyre. is good with the group. because he's from new kids. on the block but he's not doing. teamwork right but i'm like and i think you're far from your [ __ ] new kids on the block days. dude come on and i'm sitting there. holding the back of the chair. and i'm like if i if my shoulder gives out we are done wedding. over dude but guess what though. dude i connect with my breathing. right and i go hey i don't think i'm not gonna drop her. i know i'm not going to. drop her we eventually. put her down and you know. it was we were doing it. for a while and i go guys yeah. we should probably and then we get down. and then we put her down and then i go [ __ ] yeah dude and i walk away do it again. homer in the [ __ ] back. of the bushes right. [ __ ] i didn't know that you gotta lift more people up like we did the couple and then all of a sudden tap tap i look over joy. mcintyre and i go oh god. dude [music] oh god. the wrong stuff i'm not doing. this dude and joey goes bro. you're you're a big guy. we gotta we got it. there's more and i go oh okay. dude guess who i gotta pick up. the [ __ ] father of the bro. dude he looks like he played for the [ __ ] [ __ ] husky what's that. corn husk what's the [ __ ] did the guy look like he played for the [ __ ] nebraska what is it corner corn. huskers he looked like he's a [ __ ] tight. end for the [ __ ] court i mean. the guy's a man. dude he's just a and i'm like jesus. and in my head he's taller. than me i don't think he is because i'm a tall. drink of water but i'm like we gotta pick him. up okay and then as i'm walking. up to the thing with joe. mcintyre right i'm like okay. chris remember the shoulder thing how sore it. was holding the back and she's petite. so this time do it with your left. hand okay so i'm thinking. about this as i'm going. up to the [ __ ] thing and i'm like you know i'm secretly i'm like all right. look i am a big. guy joe mcintyre said it okay i'm i'm done. to play it's cool. that he knows i'm a big. guy right so i gotta do it. hey dude this is my [ __ ] thing it's like i'm. a big guy i gotta do it. i'm one of the taller. dudes here i mean most of the guys were jewish. so i get to. the [ __ ] i get to. the thing and i go remember. use your left hand and what. do i do dude. i take my right hand and pull it up and the [ __ ] dad's up. and i'm using my right. hand dude hey buddy cop. hey body do what the brain. is that dude i swear to. god it was like it was like when i go to. the dodger games and i'm like well i'm not gonna eat a dodger. dog and i walk in and go. directly to the dodger. dogs dude well i gotta eat healthy i don't wanna oh it's like i didn't like why am i wasting my brain. and body's time and so i picked the thing. up and now i look and i'm with joe. mcintyre and some other [ __ ] you know guys that. you'd recognize because this is [ __ ] adam knows everybody. and i'm holding the [ __ ] thing and i go oh and i look and i'm the only one holding the back. again the dad's like two. bucks up there and i'm do and i'm oh god. and i [ __ ] i'm like well i'll be sore. tomorrow and dude it's three days later oh [ __ ] man anyway dude it was really a [ __ ] great wedding despite all that mess with my shoulder um and then we had some fun times you know there were a lot of cool people there you know eric griffin was there jonathan kite uh uh and uh you know jeremiah watkins was there um and all the girlfriends which was very sweet adam devine was there super fun hadn't seen him seen him in a long time almost dropping. my mouth um but yeah man. it was great that whole wedding. was just [ __ ] um um yeah and then we went back. to the room dude. and it was and kristen was already. asleep she went to. sleep with uh he said uh that. that we were going to. uh the uh what was i saying.

[ __ ] issues but my god dude he's so funny. and it's sad take away. all that you got to. take away all that because if you actually. live in the world and understand. what's happening it's sad. if you think about all that. he [ __ ] iced that. [ __ ] comedically it was a jewish. doctor i mean just like we knew already. you know well i already know. where it was going. and that from jump so uh connie is [ __ ] hilarious. dude i feel real. you know he's funny like trump's. funny he's funny you know. what i mean it's just iced. it yes got me. got me good oh it. just got me just iced. it um honestly uh kanye. should just be like that was my halloween. costume it's just an antisemite. adidas let me have that. deal back i'm a guy tried to. go into skechers. tried to go into.

[ __ ] on i got my hat that that's got the front bill. and the back belt and i'm here with a magnifying glass because if you experience trauma. on april 7th what. you doing all good i don't. know the issue let's read on. on the seventh i faced racist. and transphobic remarks from an artistic director working. in one of bc's school. districts on the 8th i. witnessed a culturally appropriated appointments. performance by a local nonblack hiphop instructor who publicly humiliated me. in the black community after i highlighted her. lack of cultural and historical context. about hiphop um where am i here. this had to be addressed as it. could be harmful for the children. she educates in school. she admitted that her dance school. does not have a single black. instructor because they lack the 10. years of experience she's looking for my employer. took no action with either. the transphobic educator or the dance instructor not. even an email of acknowledging. was of acknowledgment was sent. to the colleagues in support. of the only black employee i. had a mental breakdown and left the event. early with permission from my employer only to. later receive a text that the staff. photo was overlooked and was taken without me. wow i was excluded which further alienated me. wow additionally after this traumatic event. like we got to. bend the whole thing because this woman. thinks we're trans i don't know. if she i don't know just after this. traumatic event celebratory messages were shared internationally. about how successful. the event was completely. dismissing my trauma oh my god until i brought these insensitive. and her truth and hurtful messages. to their attention okay there's more i don't want to. read it if you're bored. go [ __ ] yourself racial trauma has tremendously impacted my mental. and physical health in ways. i never experienced before that. sentence alone can live you know. i haven't been eating drinking. or sleeping well all right. well that's my sense of taste. and smell change oh even food. i used to. enjoy smells proposal. what have you found out. later she's pregnant i have severe neck and shoulder pain that i'm currently treating out of pocket. since my extended health coverage to. work has been exceeded you have shoulder. pain because of a white guy. doing hiphop i have suffered multiple anxiety. attacks in public which is why. i limited commuting on public. transit and i'm using lyft. uber instead my adhd symptoms worsened as my. brain feels extremely overwhelmed trying to. navigate ways to. cope with the trauma financial burden and stress most of the time i have extreme fear of leaving my apartment unless i am with my friends it takes me hours to. play leaving i'm right with you there. but that's because of my ocd. and a lot of times i get so physically. exhausted from thinking and planning. i just give up and don't leave kwell i recently. completed my second ma degree. that resulted in me drowning. in more debt and student. loans i intend on push publishing my ma thesis. apply for art grants complete. our projects and more but following this. trauma i missed. every deadline is there more no hmm i expected to. expect it to. is this a parody. it's real thank you so much. for everyone who donated here. and for etransferred me some funds. i haven't posted an update. in a bit because i was waiting. to hear back some details from my employer also due. to my severe ptsd. resulting from the racial trauma. i have physical symptoms now every time. i think of my workplace. gag nausea severe muscle pain. one of the triggers is my gofundme. which is why it took me some time. to write an update. here uh god see what the [ __ ] it's like this. is the thing man it's hard. enough to deal with somebody. who has one problem this. person has 10 problems and it is expecting the world to. bend to it we can't. do that because there's seven billion people in the world. dude if there were 10. people this woman was in a class. and everyone was like we don't know. what to do with her. just leave there's seven people billion people in this. world if the world changes. for you it's [ __ ] for so many other people dude. put one step in front of the other and i hate. being like this but you push i'm a centrist. but you got to. just get out there. man i know you're not asking for my advice. but you put it online. dude she's got three thousand. dollars she made three thousand dollars. on her gofundme who's [ __ ] donating i'm gonna donate. for real ah what what are. you what can you what can. you say to. these people it's a mental. condition huh i mean. we all have mental conditions. i have mental conditions i have ocd. it's hard for me do something. to trigger my ocd. some things trigger. my ptsd i don't blame anybody. about it you know. i try not to. i at least try not to. right to get to. the point where you're writing a whole. i wish people took like none of this. none of this is her fault. you know and i don't think you should bully. her or this is a comedy. podcast and i feel for this. woman man i just think that she you know. people like this might need some help. i don't feel for her because she got racially traumatized i feel. for her because this [ __ ] she can't sit in a class. without finding a problem with it. like that she can't even. be at home without finding a problem. this is a real issue. dude sometimes my ocd. gets the best of me. and i stay in my [ __ ] bed for a long time. i don't even think about blaming. someone else for that i mean. yeah i blame other people for lots. of things like [ __ ] you know if i forget to. bring water up to. the bedroom when i'm going to. bed maybe it's because my wife. distracted me and that's her. fault but i'm not starting. to gofundme because of it. guys my wife distracted. me when i tried to. go upstairs i needed water. i'm dealing with severe trauma. in bed because i don't want to. go downstairs i can't leave. because she knows i have bad. ocd and i already set up. for bed so i'm up. here and she wants me. to go get water. for her but i was having the water. and then i put it down at the bottom of the stairs. because she asked me. to clean the dishes. and you know the dishes. were mine but i cleaned them. up and then when i went upstairs. i forgot to water. i had the water anyway i'm trying. to get five thousand dollars. because i think that that's what it's worth. that i forgot the water. i woke up parched and my ocd. was absolutely flaming my wife. didn't go get it it resulted. in a [ __ ] uh you know a speed bump in my marriage. so it's like what the [ __ ] do i do can people donate. i probably could get some money. for that honestly i definitely could get some money. for that if i was indigenous. i'm from the sioux tribe. secretly i think my adopted. grandmother is jewish no. no [ __ ] man [music] the doctor was jewish. um i think i don't know people think [ __ ] is crazy. but also there's so many [ __ ] things that are so crazy. out there in the world i just can't believe it. the internet [ __ ] everything up didn't it. because now these crazy. people find each other right. these crazy people find each other she gets sympathy. sympathy and sympathizers whereas what. she needs are doctors now i don't know. this this woman she could be trolling. i have no [ __ ] idea but people who do this. the people that you don't. invite to thanksgiving now. have a community online. on these gofundme's or whatever. the [ __ ] it is you know and it's like yeah this is it dude. i was watching this. thing on vice the other day. about uh the targeted community. they think that they're being targeted. for something people think they're being stalked. when they're not being stalked. people think that they're being um like literally controlled. by electronic pulses that the government like these are people that think they're targeted. and know they're targeted even though. they're not and they found each other online. and they identify as a targeted. community and they're like so happy. they found each other because nobody else gets it. but they're being stalked. not stalked and also controlled. with electronic pulses through the government. not being controlled by electronic pulses. to the government but they all found each other. and they're all like [ __ ] yeah now we're thriving and it's like oh but instead of finding each other find alexa pro instead of finding each other snort alprazolam not that i don't know i'm not a doctor but it's like dude. and i'm here taking [ __ ] five ants. and i'm here [ __ ] taking an alprazolam every time somebody you know my [ __ ] spikes i weaned off it all and i never really had a problem maybe i did i have no idea what a problem is but my point. is wow my point is. wow um yeah it's a weird [ __ ] time man. you talk to 70. year olds about this. time and they're just like oh yeah. it's never been worse. i don't know if that's true. right i mean there is a war. in the ukraine but we're not there. you know maybe it was bad. in vietnam the time. when everybody but everyone was [ __ ] around. then everyone was like just straight up squirting. right that was like the free. love movement it was probably really bad in the 1800s. you know people would die. because they got a toothache times are good. let's just realize it how about that. that's the main thing times are good. let's just realize it yeah. you got a white guy. coaching hip hop and no black people in the hiphop class. but you know what is out. the window scurvy we're gonna be fine. you can find a peach at a [ __ ] whole foods near you. how about that you're not gonna die. of scurvy okay yeah it sucks. somebody is culturally appropriating even though. i don't even believe in that. because who knows where anything. started right people are like don't wear dreads. if you're white but then it's like okay because black people came up. with dreadlocks but then it's like dude. i watch house of dragons. and that took place in like the year. 100 and everyone's got dreadlocks so. it's like when did it. start i watch house. of dragons and you forget. that that wasn't how it was until. you see a dragon you're like oh wait this. is fiction man. that show let me tell you something. game of thrones not into. it house of dragons. yes they did it you know. why it's about one.
