but it's fine. dude guess what los angeles. you know i just been thinking i've been spending some time. thinking about los angeles. and about how it's different. now it's been different ever. since covet and all that. now it's like really expensive. it's even still it's been expensive. but at least at least like we had it. going right and now it's like we don't really have it. going because it went crazy. right la went pretty woke and it's pretty. crazy but also though it's not really that. sunny anymore but those days are over. because apparently the sun is coming out. on the horizon and it's going. to be sunny so that's going. to uplift my mood thank god. because dude when i wake up. and it's cloudy out cloudy. out giveaway is absolutely sad. but um it is weird. how much that dictates my uh. attitude yes dude if there's a cloud in the sky i can deal with it if there's like five guys in this guy oh no he gets sad dude basically he just gets sad because of clouds i need to. see that sun i need to. wake up and go out i'm like a flower. dude i need to. go out sit in the sun and just take it in right. just take it in especially since i'm really into. my health lately just taking it in guess. what i ate yesterday. salmon and rice only dude. that's it i'll be sick. of it for real soon. thought about today when i woke up baby. i have more salmon and rice. i go yeah maybe once and then i want to. eat other stuff because but i'm on a health kick my babies. jesus christ he's on a health. kick i mean what's going. on but yeah man uh i hit the gym. a lot i do only legs. go figure i do only legs. is it an exercise. if your knees don't bend i don't. know dude don't talk to. me about that i met. my knees all the time. so uh yeah dude uh got the yat got some gaps. done then they go remember don't work. out i say sure got home took a shower then. slept woke up worked out i make my own rules. right i make my own. rules um i went to. uh the gym and i did. i said maybe if i got get it. on the arm it's okay. i could do my legs went. did some squats didn't ego. lift i do not ego. lift i want to. because of my ego but my other ego. goes like this hey first ego. you don't need to. be doing that and then i go like this. yeah and we all agree. and my ego because my ego. goes like this all right. fine so i do a lot. of reps i do a lot. of sets instead of just doing one. right now i still did. squats the next day i did. deadlifts can you do that. yes should you do that i don't know. there's a bit of a mixed. reaction on it should you do. big you know it's lags and legs. yes but it's more hamstrings the second. one and whatever i don't want. to bore you with all. the details right but uh i'm gonna be super tattooed and super ripped so watch out. summer my wife is one. lucky woman yeah she actually says she wants me. to be fat so i don't know what that. is but uh definitely wives. like to be make your uh husband fat. because then it uh it keeps the threat. situation at like a low. level right you see me yachted up. you see your husband got it. up you see your husband. yeah it up and absolutely just shredded. the striations coming coming out. saying hi how you doing. the striations running for mayor. right giving speeches you want that. no because then what trouble because who looks at striations. and the added up beings chicks. and then uh oh right. but you gotta have a husband with a strong. mind that's the added to. the gills and striations. are saying hi good morning. and he's still kind of you. know what i mean about that. home family life so yeah i do extra. sets and i don't ego lift. ego lifting is when you're a guy that wants. to try and do the most he can and it. suffers the form makes you. suffer right right like you're doing deadlifts but you're concaving over. like you're trying to. suck your own piece you know. trying to do deadlifts and you're not keeping the lats. engaged you just hunched over like a question. mark you know what i'm saying. but i don't do that man. um but yeah my lower back. sort of [ __ ] but it's all good um but i just want my [ __ ] to. you know i don't know man. i'm talking too much about it. but honestly that's why you come to. this podcast for the hardhitting truths speaking. of which the grow or die. merch is out i keep forgetting. to plug this on the podcast. but the grow or die. merch is out it is absolutely ill. i made the grower die. come across the back. of the shoulders so you could see it. if you're a big dude that [ __ ] spreads out. real nice doesn't look too. small goes a little bit over. the shoulders spreads out real. nice if you're a [ __ ] you know what i mean. if you're a guy who's got who's who who and they filming. movies on your back. because of the mountain ranges right. um and the open land. in the space so yeah. go get that to. grow dimerge chrysalia dot com. and uh and that's really been my whole. thing it's it's nice being you know. a data too i spent a lot of time with my my sons and my family it's been fun man it's been really fun my new son william uh spits up so much it's he's like a sprinkler it's unbelievable dude he'll just be also he spits up not even when he's eating like i get it to. spit up after you're eating you know you're eating the milk. right either whether it's formula. or tip milk you're eating. it and then you and then and then and then just he goes also it's so weird. when a baby spits up. because it's not you can't. say throw up it's definitely spit. up because it's just it's just they'll. do it like in the middle. of stuff which babies don't really do anything. but if they were to. do stuff it's like they would do it. in the middle of stuff. like they'd just be like lint rolling. just like this just let let [ __ ] just milk. just let it just right. all over the desk while you're typing but yeah. william will just be chilling. in there but then we'll just be watching tv. or something and he just goes and i'm like you haven't. even eaten in [ __ ] two hours dude. how much is [ __ ] not like hey stomach decide when this [ __ ] doesn't agree with you earlier. you know his stomach's like my wife. always giving people like you know. i maybe they're you know. what maybe they had a bad day. and then me i'm like nah. i don't want to. be around at all period. um so yeah uh i don't know. i posted the thing it dude. the internet i only use instagram. i use tick tock. too i don't really look. at i don't look at tick. tock i look at instagram. it's the only one i look at i think period. i really think um and i posted. a thing on my podcast. i think it was last episode. or two episodes ago. where i was talking about. since it was pride month. look i didn't even know. pride has to do. with all of the the lgbtqs all of them. not just gay it. used to be just gay. and now it's like yeah get them. all involved all right fine dude. it's crazy how much they're they're promoting this. [ __ ] these companies okay now i don't really give a [ __ ] because who cares but but dude. i turned on one. of the apps like uh i don't remember which one it was you know. i got hbo i got i got i got all. right max i got paramount i. got netflix i got all the different. ones i turned on one. of them disney i don't know. which one it is dude. and i get it first of all i kind of think everyone is. kind of on the spectrum. of gayness right like you either. don't i think there's a spectrum. right you either blast dudes. you think about blasting dudes. or you just simply don't blast. dudes right now i think a lot of those people who blast dudes. are living their best lives a lot. of those people who think who think about blasting. dudes kind of think that they should be blasting. dudes but they're not doing it. because society says and i think that a lot. of the people who don't blast dudes. are over correcting because they want. to blast dudes but then there is that minority. we're really we just don't want to. blast dudes and that's where i fit in okay. i think unless my subconscious. is really really good or bad. i should say maybe it's overcompensating. right but i'll tell you right. now to your straight. to your face i'm blasted. zero dudes just period zero. kissed one guy and it was a joke. and it was in high school. we were both in high school. and then we were doing it. we was like ah come on. let's kiss on the lips. hahaha and i did it. and it was in front of some chicks. and we were all having a you know. as a laugh but it felt weird. you know and i think it. actually felt weird because it felt weird. and i've never done it. before not because it actually i was like stirring. up some [ __ ] in my because otherwise i'd be blasting. dude central at this. point you know me right. but um anyway uh if you turn on apps. first of all every three months. is pride month i don't give a [ __ ] what. everyone says i i see it. all every time there's probably a month. i'm like didn't this [ __ ] just no okay sometimes i wish i was gay. so i could be like [ __ ] this month. man just let me be gay. and chill but this this. is crazy dude i turn on this. streamer and it had it was like celebrate your you know. the gayness of everyone and then also trans. and then and it had the people. on the thing they looked like it. was they were shooting a sketch you know it. was like you couldn't tell if it was a guy. or a girl in a hat. and he was and then another person. it was like i don't know what that person. is and then they had two guys. that looked like gay. guys and i was like cool. fine but then it's like i just want to. watch the floor is lava. you know and it's fine. but it would here's why. it bothers me because the corporations. actually don't give a [ __ ] that's why. it bothers me because they don't care. and so gays are like i'm coming. up look at this. month we have look hbo. max is involved really they're just involved. because of the money aspect but then i don't know. man i don't i don't know i don't know i don't know about the issues. i don't care about the issues. i i think everybody should be able. to live their [ __ ] lives as long as they're not hurting each other. and then i understand why somebody who wants to. watch the wire do you know what i mean. and then they turn on some [ __ ] and you gotta see you know like this whole thing. about trans uh uh uh uh women. or whatever in the kindergarten. talking about sexuality with the kids. it's like not so dude. it's nutso it's not but we talk about what. we talk about and honestly. i'm trans so [ __ ] it um but i i brought this. up because i put this uh uh like i don't know i just feel like if i'm like i'm so not that. though like i'm so not about anytime. that's my problem anytime there's a somebody wants me. to be a part of a group i'm. like nah nah nah no no. no no like when i was in college. and they were like you know. we got frats i was like bro. dude you guys there is no. [ __ ] way i'm joining period. you know when people are you know that. whole thing join or die. all right dude make the gun talk to. me because i'm done dude. i'm not join or die. you're gonna be like that okay. i don't want to. [ __ ] join dude that's why i hate all this. pressure to become you. know vocal about [ __ ] issues. when i don't even know. about the [ __ ] issues and i walk around and i see it in the world and nobody knows about the issues. they're just like i'm just trying to. work hey can i have a job. uh uh so yeah the reason. why i bring it up. is because i this is how i feel if you listen. to this podcast you know it's how i feel right. um and i posted a clip. of me saying i think everyone should be gay. um here it's right. here i posted this. clip on from the last. episode or maybe it's the last episode. whoops no it's this old dude. [ __ ] [ __ ] dudes straight up i wish i could do it but it's like you know bungee jumping for me i just kind of i don't want to. and so that whatever i i i i and then so i put and i i um pride on it. just as a joke and and it they make it rainbowy. which i didn't know that. if they did that maybe i wouldn't bro. the [ __ ] people look i'm out of here. sellout that he says chill. bro i'm actually gonna unfollow. lol chris is falling off now with this. bs look at illuminati. got him the other guy. [ __ ] done with this dude guy right so woke dude it's the opposite. look sold his soul soul he said bro. really not you as well they acting like i'm on. these front lines everyone's a [ __ ] i don't

dude. um fantastic it fell fantastic. i don't care um. anyway dude i i don't understand. the the the people on the in they just the internet. isn't real dude do you know. that do you know. the internet isn't [ __ ] real it's absolutely bonkers. it's crazy dude like i kind of want. to be on everybody's. side but the interview that's why. i say don't push me. the internet makes you have to. pick a side and if you don't then they'll do. it for you i i i am. the product of the environment. that i was raised. in that's what tupac said. and when i was 16. i go like this he's right. and now he's right. more right than ever um uh yeah it's so weird. all of this is so weird. and i don't i think honestly in 10. years we're gonna look back. on this time and we're gonna be like yo that. was crazy huh all of it. all of it i don't mean. the issues i just mean. all of it everything that's happening. i mean donald trump. posts like silly memes. of his of his rivals the the president. do you know what i mean. joe biden can't stand up. uh period what i don't understand. is joe biden he just keeps falling. down hey guy just sit down. right you could be the president. and just keep sitting fdr nailed it. the guy couldn't walk and everyone's like yeah. hey biden stop trying just sit down. if that dude just sit down and stop talking dude. we would be [ __ ] killing it. that's biden whoops ladies and gentlemen. joe biden whoops oh [ __ ] he fell hey bun you okay oh [ __ ] hey sit in a chair put some [ __ ] wheels on it and then trump's all out there just [ __ ] putting me dude it's bonkers it's bonkers and look i have literally the [ __ ] left will be like [ __ ] this guy for saying this and then the right will be like [ __ ] this guy's a sellout because of the left because because all of it is crazy all of it is crazy dude all of it all of it anybody who's too right or two left is [ __ ] bat [ __ ] period. batshit if you're not in the middle. you are batshit um. and that's what's up and dude. walk around see it get off the internet. go see it because this is the stuff. that [ __ ] is incendiary you talk about black lives matter is it good in essence. yes it's a nice idea did the founders of black. lives matter buy [ __ ] mansions and stocks with the money that was [ __ ] given to. black lives matter i mean that's what they say. if that happened ah yep you piece. of [ __ ] but you all know this you all know this if you take funds allocated. for something that's supposed to. do something and you don't do that. thing and you do the other things like by mansions and put it in stocks you. piece of [ __ ] it doesn't mean that the idea of black lives matter is a bad idea at its core. but you start doing all that. other [ __ ] see that's what happened. and guess who else does that. by the way the government they all do this [ __ ] they all do this [ __ ] they take the funds and they go like this these funds are cool. and i will allocate them. for the things but also check out. that maserati that's what they do. because that's human nature. and you know so it's like you know it. is what it is tough out. there you know stuff. out there and i'm not even political. baby i'm not political at. all you know the most political i ever. get is when i do the dirty. republican with my wife in bed. sorry the lazy republican when i do the lazy republican. with my wife in bed. that's as political as i get it's when you lay down. next to the person and the wife. is in front of you. and you're on the side. and you do it like you would be doing doggy. style but you're both just chilling. you know what i mean. that's a laser republican. although now that i think about it. republicans probably have sex like just absolutely invigorating. sex you know right. i feel like probably democrats have either. like well the safest weirdest safest. non dirty sex because they're like sign. here or you know. it's on the wall if we're gonna do it. you're like okay so i don't know all right. put your thumb print here. yeah cool there we go. i'll lay down and you enter splurt. splurt and we're splurting and there. we go okay cool. now sign the wall out time. um the republicans are probably just like honestly. dude this is when this is when this is when democrats do. it [music] and then this is when republicans. do it dude nope this. one just only a blazer on both. of them that's all out. blazers [ __ ] just getting all messed up with the tits all out lopping around on the blazer dude whatever man we talk about what we talk about my babies and yeah dude i am going to. be in nashville coming up. september 9th so get your tickets. at chrysalia dot com um everyone. in my household was sick. for like two weeks. but not me though dude. i kept it real. not me part of the reason. i don't get sick. is because i don't allow. it do you understand. that i don't allow. it i feel it and i go oh yeah okay. i see what's going on. here i see what's going. on here yep and i go. like this hey i'll get some rest we'll see where we at. tomorrow bro a lot of times i wake up the next day. and i'm better sometimes i wake up. the next day and i'm not better. sometimes i'm worse but you can't. convince my mind that dude. i truck through it i trucked. through it and i started snapping at people because i don't want to. admit that i'm sick and then people say [ __ ] like hey um you know i'm in the bathroom. and someone knocks or something. i'm like why do you think i'd be. in here you think i'd be in here. for any um longer length of time. than i would necessarily be or what we think. i'm doing it in here. [ __ ] a dj set i'm i'm either. pooping or i'm pooping right. because it's taking too so long so i obviously i have a problem. so you don't need to. knock on the toilet. right ain't that the truth. huh cause whoever the [ __ ] hangs out. in a coffee being a tea. leaf bathroom for any other reason. than they need to. because they're [ __ ] [ __ ] huh all right we can find it on the thing computer so here i just play it on my phone this guy a few examples of how you can worship your partner's [ __ ] you can take one of these things and do it or you can combine a few or even all of the examples. that i'm going to. give you in one. [ __ ] worship ritual i mean. [ __ ] is [ __ ] gazing simply look at your partner's [ __ ] and hey we call that pervan you want to. worship the [ __ ] look at the partner's. [ __ ] just look at it. [ __ ] gazing stare at it it doesn't matter if you're in public they have a skirt and get lower [ __ ] look at it okay um also getting inside her a way to. worship it thrusting in and out. splurting right thinking of other. women when you're inside a [ __ ] think of another [ __ ] and healing things. that you can do especially because so many women. experience a lot of insecurities. about how the revolver. vagina and [ __ ] looks like imagine the guy dude how insecure you'd be after that guy saying that to. you that's why i like to. go wow that is just absolutely beautiful. you know what you

that. eight news now investigator david charns reported. about how metro police responded back on may 1st. after receiving a strange. call from a very dude. it's not aliens you. know they're [ __ ] idiots that they interviewed as you know. this is not our first ufo. rodeo we first heard about he's so pissed. that they have to. do it too it doesn't believe. in aliens okay here. we go hard they later. heard footsteps on their roof. they saw one of the eight. foot tall creatures climb behind. them dude this is [ __ ] news. come on later heard footsteps. on their roof they. saw one of the eight. foot tall creatures climbed behind. the controls of a large. front loader stored in the yard. as if trying to. engage it oh yeah also they did mushrooms. first got a good look at the creatures he said. a greenish grayish being with large. eyes and long legs he says he could hear its deep breaths. and when he locked eyes. he was in essence. frozen in place. couldn't move in the dude. i don't believe anybody who's frozen. who says and i couldn't move. because you can do it. you can't believe somebody who thinks that they lock up. because they're scared when you can just [ __ ] keep walking. dude these [ __ ] and oh and the aliens. let me guess dude. yeah they all had big eyes. and they were lanky and eight. feet tall oh really dude. they all look like the cover of that. book communion that my dad used. to read back in the [ __ ] 90s all of them dude they all look like that just once just once i want them i want to. hear it was actually crazy. how much they all looked like bb king and they had. a guitar too the middle of the yard. where the object had crashed. then vanished oh god. dude you know killer. impression was left in the soil. okay where is this. on your property these are my. favorite police dispatcher initially wondered whether to. send a crisis intervention. team that's the meaning they think he's crazy. the troubled witness but then. took the incident seriously two. officers arrived 38 minutes after. the call too long. if they're aliens dude. everyone have been zapped to. high heaven officers showed up. after a donut and some coffee. and took a [ __ ] [ __ ] and then they went by then it heard from other officers they proceeded cautiously and managed some nervous laughs i ain't dealing with that so nervous man i ain't dealing with that dude we gotta add that's the most nervous lessons i heard the [ __ ] jayz laugh ers they proceeded cautiously and managed some nervous laughs i ain't dealing with that that's a match. dude a few days later. the family says two metro sergeants returned. to the scene to. ask followers is so boring you know i saw men in suits and sunglasses driving in a car with government plates. dude they're

[ __ ] thing and it was eight feet. tall and they called some [ __ ] and then there was a [ __ ] outline in the ground. you know i heard its breath. dude and slowly. past the house in the following. days nellis and creech have denied any interest. or involvement with the incident metro has indicated they believed the family. that something crashed in their yard. but what you mentioned george. in that piece that you know. they were frozen because so many. people have been critical of like why. didn't get their phone out why didn't they video do we know. if there's even anything uh yes and no so there's a surveillance camera. in the backyard yeah property. owner keeps that because he's like got a lot. of expenses and let me guess. what we were told is that at the moment. this thing comes
