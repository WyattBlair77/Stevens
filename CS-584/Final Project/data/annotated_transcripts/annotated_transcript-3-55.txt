[ __ ] figure it out so i don't know about the ideas. where the [ __ ] huh. where they're not just [ __ ] only because we were in the 90s. yes but not only because so how do you feel about the 80s. though whatever this oh so you feel more. about the 90s this. year oh oh it was more than words. remember oh yeah dude and i'm good though. yeah i hated the [ __ ] i loved. it dude the video was so sick. they had the long hair. without the pony they're the one. guy had the pony and the other guy. they were brothers like me. and you and they had really long. curtain sheet curtain [ __ ] dark dark hair. dude yeah they would fall over. yeah oh more than one. on the ground with his hair. like i can't get up. i can't get up to. heavy wow um remember when you pushed. nick shooper's backpack yup. because it looked like it. was too heavy it took. so long for me. to fall down he [ __ ] fell over he was trying. so hard to stay. up and i just go dunk. because his backpack was so big. dude this kid's backpack it was so mean. that you did that he needs. to learn bro that was so mean no the best. part was he was trying. to get up on a curb. and that's what did it. yeah that's what he was absolutely. did by the curb and then fell bro. we laughed for [ __ ] time i was looking at his face and you know like when you watch shark. attacks there's no expression. in their face there's no change the scariest thing about shark. attack is that it doesn't feel anything. about it yeah that was nick schubert's. face unbelievable dude that's what a great. [ __ ] i wish i thought of that i'm gonna steal that okay um wow dude just being a shark. falling down yeah just being a [ __ ] this is what happens to. me with a backpack this. big boom yeah that's what it. was yeah well so what about the 90s. and then what about the 80s. because i was born in 1980. you were born in 1983 four. three three i know that. and uh 1983 and then so you probably remember the 90s. more i remember both the 80s. in the 90s i remember. just obviously the end of the 80s. uh but the 90s. were like the thing for me. that's like wow it's weird. that like when i think about my life. most of my memories are condensed. into a very brief window. from like 12 around 12. to like 15. like so much of my memory is is is concentrated. around that period of my life. and i guess because i was so formed right. around then yeah and that would have been the mid. 90s yeah dude i was watching childhood. videos the other day. i can't watch them. i hate you like that. but why can't you i i don't know. it's like i was [ __ ] locked in a room. and [ __ ] i just i can't watch them it. makes me feel sad. dude that's what i've always said and you've always been like why that's how i feel i feel that. way always i don't know what i don't know. what it is but like i just it. makes i maybe it's i see myself. being young and youthful and happy. and then i and now it's like there's so much other things in the world. i think it just makes us. whether we realize it or not. think about dying maybe maybe especially because you see. so many people on the video. they're like oh they're dead. they're right there yeah because you killed them. yeah yeah it's just it's just weird. and it's like you gotta there's always the old person. with their [ __ ] like glasses [ __ ] pocket. thing in the pocket yeah. just like it's like a thing. anymore yeah and it just makes you realize that time. moves and everything changes and yes it's yeah. it's too much we can't. process too much feeling and emotions. i can't i can't i can't feel all that. man yeah yeah it hurts yeah i always say. i don't even like pictures. i don't like pictures of me. young around my house who's me young. was she chinese or yes. yeah i don't like pictures. of me young i don't know. no but really i don't like even looking. at me at a younger. age wow yeah it's deeper. yeah definitely yeah no that's fine. but it's deeper but i had. such a good job it. doesn't make sense like in that. sense but uh it's true. don't like it don't want. to do it you can't. make me i wonder if we were repressing anything. that like [ __ ] would like if like russians came in and just was like [ __ ] up russians went real. far russia threw us around. but no russians came in when we were that. age around eight threw us around and [ __ ] okay well and so far no i remember their names were vladimir of course i would kind of bet you were going to. say that and the other one was uh vladimir. with an o not an is that. an actual reformation yeah vladimir. and vladimir is that actual those are two russian. names i think so right. right right right vlodimir and they [ __ ] us that's i want. to say that's so confusing. but but there is jon and jen. so yeah john and john just no. h anyway they [ __ ] us the worst high five yeah toyota for all of us listening we high five the back end but food i love what you do for me remember when the guy would [ __ ] jump on me like this so [ __ ] dude i wanted to. sell after that plummeting dude. he goes like this toyota. yes boom freeze i love. what you do for me. toyota dude the most bitchass. [ __ ] bro was that and that was 90s. was that did you know. what i love doing i for hours. on end i can sit there. and watch and this is what youtube's great. for youtube yeah [ __ ] oh dude all of you if anybody has anything negative. to say about youtube. youtube is the greatest thing. that ever happened the internet. in general obviously good sides. and bad sides but youtube and also wikipedia not only can you [ __ ] learn anything wikipedia that ever existed. that you want to. know about but you can also watch anything. that has ever been [ __ ] recorded on video or [ __ ] film lawyer out of work so it's the best [ __ ] thing anyway i watched 90s commercials. yeah i know it's good. and a loop on a loop. they're so bad they're like hey guys talking to. m m's and [ __ ] and the m m's are like you know what are you doing no just eating cereal right the noob yeah right so angry about it you know but damn dude i'll shoot them all but okay well that what i like about dimitri and democracy uh vladimir and florida sorry. uh but what is what is weird. is that i like thinking about how times have. changed when i'm outside of thinking. about like when i watch commercials. i like wow times have changed so much. yeah when i'm in the mix get it. get me out of here. yeah yeah i wonder what happened. to us when we were younger. deeper so let's uh get into. the show huh okay we're going. on with the advices yeah hi. chris hi matt my name is melanie i live in portland. oregon and the question. i have for you guys is in 2018. i started my own business. uh which is a daycare. center cool history already um and 2020 was projected to. be my best year obviously. covet hit yeah i'm super proud. now that it's 2022. we've made it on the other side. and i'm doing really well there's so many things i should be proud of but i'm finding. that this sense of entitlement. that people have across all industries. in any sort of social exchanges. i've observed is one where people are. just blatantly rude and and have. a sense of entitlement of how they how they should be. able to interact with each other. i feel like we forgot how. to socialize how to. talk like normal individuals uh it's really. affecting my view on going. to work i don't love what. i do anymore and uh it. is my own business and free. conch so i like do literal. and verbal spin moves on the rag um and i can't retire at 32. so. you'd like any advice on how to. survive postpandy entitlement thanks well. i think first of all it's just as the pandemic. came it's gonna go and eventually. people will reregain or retain their ability. to be in social situations. and not be total [ __ ] either weirdos. or [ __ ] everyone went through a period. where they were so [ __ ] uptight and confused. that is not a good mix and we're still all. kind of coming out of that. and everybody's [ __ ] edgy. and everybody's weird and and scared. kind of and i i think the the solution. here is uh or or my advice. here is that it's gonna pass. so just [ __ ] wait it out. and find the people that you can. make fun of and talk to. your friends about them. i guess that's a good i guess. that uh though is it. gonna get better in past. do you think because like it. i know you say the world. keeps getting better and better. i don't say that well. you say well i mean yeah you do no. no i in a in a really really really broad. sense yeah say that. like in a steven pinker. way yeah yeah yeah okay. well who's that but yeah so but like if there's like uh in the dave. flowey poop way yeah but it's like wow. in a in a [ __ ] john charisma [ __ ] well i'll be the sickest thing ever john charisma dude imagine being named john charisma hello everything's going to. get better yes um with one. of those [ __ ] what are those. [ __ ] what's the callers. that go up and down oh wow. those white ones update. more and so you know what i'm talking. about i do yeah. charisma [laughter] wow. no you know what that. is like a [ __ ] porn star that. like thinks he's better. than all the other porn. stars just doesn't want to. do like john rod or something. yeah yeah yeah like [ __ ] yeah yeah johnny. comes a lot huh. [ __ ] that dude i'm john charisma johnny. comes a lot you know. so uh anyway we talking everyone named. john what we say about. how things get better. you don't think they are democracy. comes a lot um yeah no it just seems like things. are going into. the [ __ ] and i know every generation. has always said that. they've always said that yes like they've every generation. has always been like it's getting worse. it's getting worse i mean. like [ __ ] you know they've probably seen it back. in [ __ ] roman times and [ __ ] definitely everyone has always said that yeah like they're not even feeding people to. the lions anymore where's this. country headed right and uh and so um wow thought of the worst joke. didn't say it and so um so yeah. so but you're right about now. is a unique it is. it's like a blip in the everything's getting. better all the time thing because things have stagnated. crime rates have gone up right. violent crime rates have. gone up i got you it's like education. is way [ __ ] up right. now there's [ __ ] inflation. the economy's [ __ ] up but it's all because of kovac but in a jimmy. pinkerton way it's a lot better. right steve pinker okay. okay so the thing is uh john. charisma i think that i i don't i don't i mean. look i struggle with this. honestly i i i stand. up comedy was my favorite. thing in the world and the pandemic. happened uh i i obviously could break also. because i was [ __ ] canceled. and [ __ ] but like i stopped doing standup. and then when i went back. i didn't like it the same. and it took a while for me. to get back to. where i liked it again. and what about now and now it's it's i you know. i like it a lot. but there are some nights. that i'm just i'm not feeling. it you know and that never used. to happen and i don't even. i don't even want to. admit that to myself and here's why. i'm able to admit. that to myself and be honest. about that is because i had my son. and my son is more important. than anything my family you. know my family the the three of us. more important than anything. and so so having that and um i can i can be honest. and be like it's okay to. have nights where i don't. want to go do my job. um and sometimes i find it on stage. and i'm like [ __ ] this is amazing. and sometimes i don't like the other night. i was like [ __ ] i had two shows. at the improv and i just [ __ ] with the crowds were i was like ah i didn't do so well and then i left and then i saw another i saw ian. edwards you know yeah next. the next thing he was like man. i wanted to quick stand. up after that show i was like oh [ __ ] you had a rough set two [ __ ] yeah it wasn't me you know yeah so um but yeah i don't know man look this is just part of the times it's not always it's not always going to. be like this people about her thing. though specifically i'm saying it's not always going to. be like that i know. but i know but on the heels. of that people are really uptight. about all things around. kids and watching kids anything school. related also people forgot. how to socialize in every [ __ ] area. of life people are like had they forgotten. how to be around. each other yeah and i do think that that is something. that absolutely people are going to. rebound from and people [ __ ] suck before. too don't get me. wrong but they're going to. go back to the normal. way of sucking this. new way of sucking is going. to slowly dissipate and go away. there is a uh yeah the masks. also are cra it's just everything. is just crazy i saw somebody [ __ ] uh the other day. at a place with a mask. on inside drinking something. with a straw and she would go. like this while she was eating. yeah yeah it was crazy. so she would chew. with the mask on. yeah where what was inside. good side where a cafe. making it up no a cafe. that's [ __ ] legitimately weird yeah weird. okay well that's so that's that's the point. though in two years she won't be doing i know she won't yeah right. yeah okay so what about. though right now like she wants to. know what she can do. before things get better right. right but cherry pick the stories about. the real big [ __ ] find humor in. it and go talk [ __ ] about those people to. your friends and make them laugh. make it a hobby. of your [ __ ] talking as a hobby. because the business you started is. [ __ ] sick you love. it it's what you want to. do find the little things that are so bad. it almost reaches a level of absurdity also there's more that matters. right now than your business. you understand and to. you and and i think that that's what we're you're figuring out. is that oh my business. is uh i loved it. why don't i love it. as much anymore and it's because of all of the other [ __ ] going on yeah so dude once that [ __ ] changes you'll get back on track and in the meantime dude you know do some [ __ ] you know get on tick tock oh wow do a cooking video wow for real though people there's that chick that started jumping rope on instagram and all she started in the beginning of the pandemic now she's like a professional jump roper she has millions of followers and she's just like jumping throwing the [ __ ] back and forth that's your advice to. her you know start drawing. i think find the real. absurdity in it absurdity in it. find it funny and then go talk. [ __ ] mad [ __ ] about those people behind their back i don't know if that's good but maybe in a comedic way it's okay okay yeah no it's good oh boy you want to. read it yeah i'll read it. because i didn't you read. it because it's hot. as [ __ ] okay and i don't want to. be reading it because it's hot. oh go ahead hey matt. hey chris hope everything's going. great with you guys thanks. for everything that you do huge fan. of your work especially matt. oh cool i'm a i'm a 37. years old man that's bad. bad grammar been married. for nine years and my wife and i are expecting our first child. now my wife has a couple of male friends. that she talks to. on the phone almost on a daily basis. quote male header in parentheses male heterosexual friends. okay end parentheses and to. be honest i'm okay with that. i get that it's healthy. for our friends to. talk to and i trust her completely so this. really isn't an issue i on the other hand. another parenthetical and here comes the advice. part and parenthetical do not have any female friends. all of my friends. are male so i wonder sometimes if i should reach out. to old female friends. i used to. have see how they're doing or is. this [ __ ] because in the end i'll just end up wanting to. [ __ ] them that guy puts asterisks like we don't say [ __ ] and [ __ ] all the time so just wondering what you think of this situation but also in general when it comes to. married man having female friends. versus married woman having male friends. thanks again and i apologize. for any spelling and or grammar errors. i might have purified safari. he wrote safari uh yeah i i um i don't think. it's a big deal if he's saying his wife has a couple male friends. that she talks on the phone. almost daily a daily basis do you he says oh he's okay with that i get it. something for her to. have friends to talk to. and i trust completely so this. really is an issue so why so the want. to keep in touch with other f. he doesn't have female friends. he just wants to. he just wants to. [ __ ] other people i think honestly really and be around them yeah i'm just like if you're really okay with it then like that's the end there's no advice you don't seek out nonfriends to. become friends with them that's not how like they're if they're your friend. already then great yeah become friends. with them then great but you don't like is this. like retaliatory like what the [ __ ] is it. it seems like it's retaliatory but the thing. about it is bad. but the thing of course that's bad. but the thing about it. is making new friends of the opposite. sex is definitely a little bit. more dicey than may than. an old butt like are these the dude. friends that he has that she has yeah if she's had them yeah before him. yeah then [ __ ] it you know what i mean. of course you know. yeah like i mean who cares. yeah anything i i i this. is just crazy this. is just so much i don't know if you want. to [ __ ] people other people but like on the other hand here comes the advice part. do not have any female friends. all of my friends. are male so i wonder sometimes if i should reach out. to old female friends. i used to. have and see here's the thing. that's so weird if you're really okay. with it you wouldn't have that. next thought i think he's not okay. he's not okay with it okay. we figured that out. yes he knows he should be okay. with it and he's right. about that but he's not just acknowledge that you're not okay. with that and then ask yourself. why because you really shouldn't. be with it doesn't [ __ ] matter dude. it doesn't matter you said. you say yourself you [ __ ] trust her go to. her right now and be like baby. you've got a lot. of male friends i'm insecure. about it that's what my advice. is is everything cool and also do you think maybe you could back. off with that or are you. going to be like no. those are my friends. and then i got to. deal with it because maybe she'll be like huh. yeah i guess i do talk. to them quite a bit maybe i should open. up to you more. yes dude maybe dr phil. eat your heart out but she shouldn't even like regardless. of him she shouldn't become less. good of friends with these friends. of hers just because he's insecure. yes what they should work. on is trying to. make him less insecure. yes and that mostly comes. from him yes again. not trying to get new chicks. to god is just what the [ __ ] or old exes. old flags hey what's up. my girlfriend's on the phone. with one of her guy. friends what you doing wanna. hang yeah hello well work's been good. i don't want to. [ __ ] you i i swear. i don't want to. [ __ ] you because it's this i'm doing the same thing. that my wife's doing and she doesn't want to.

[ __ ] thing comes into. play yes figured it out. and i think i can relate to. that right i know 100. i want to. do like four things how many do you want. to do yeah less yeah. okay there we go so it's not a combination. two things right i want. to do one thing. but like i want to. do half of a thing. but so i've never done. anything so but this that's what this. guy is because this guy i i see and i'm like i'm looking at this. and i'm like am i sherlock. holmes do you know what. i mean like because because i i see it. and i know the answer. but why do i know. the answer right because i'm doing all this. stuff subconsciously like focusing on the lint on this. thing all he took it to. the dry cleaners oh the [ __ ] you know what i mean oh i know what you mean bunched up. but what do you mean. real quick and i get it. okay and i don't even know. why but now i get it. because i did a sherlock. holmes thing where i'm like dude. you're not organized really yeah. that's very interesting well then why. do you have six guitars placed in. a [ __ ] neat fashion. like that equal distance same. height i don't buy it either and also you have that mask on it. was ready wasn't it you. thought about this so it's not about organization. it's about you don't want to. do the things that you don't. want to do yeah. yes i identify with that. and i'm like sherlock. holmes is stop saying that part though. i'm like that was like sherlock. holmes that wasn't anything like sherlock. holmes there's nobody dead. nothing's stolen you sure that comes real. uh no so nobody's like sherlock. holmes yeah including you yes. no but i think yes i think that i think that guy. needs to i would suggest. and hear me dude. [ __ ] you know what i mean okay fourth down and i'm [ __ ] and i see the guy and i'm like this is what we got to. go for we're down because i'm just gonna go. for the hail mary okay. i think you need a whole. [ __ ] life change what they call it. the circadian rhythm like you're not getting. it yeah yeah you're not getting. it dude you gotta you gotta wake up. in the day do the day. sleep at night and and maybe there's another shift. he can do i mean. you know he asked for it. already yeah maybe maybe maybe not okay. yeah if there's another possible. shift ask for that but uh do uber eats if you're asking what the reason. is that you're disorganized. i keep doing it. because i made this stupid. [ __ ] joke disorganized. and sort of all over the place. can't get your [ __ ] together so to. speak i think uh your job. has so much to do with it. um so just know that and be a little easier. on yourself about it. but uh i think as chris said even. though i don't like how he studies sherlock. holmes he's probably right. in that you're talking about. the things in life. that none of us actually want. to do so just [ __ ] do them because you're a [ __ ] adult. yeah also uh yeah no that's that's right. i do agree with that. i agree with myself okay. yeah so let's do it. let's see the next one. my baby all right guys. here's the dilemma make this quick start talking this. girl when i lived in california. from back in washington we facetimed every night got close. one day she stops talking to. me a little bit time. goes by i find out. she's having an affair with one. of my friends dads. wow and i was like whoa. it got messy ready got sloppy. i get back home she got a fat. ass so she hit me. up one day and i was like i still want. to hit it she comes. over i hit it then she starts. talking about dating and i was like nah. and then she freaks out. on me tells me i'm a [ __ ] boy tells me she regrets having sex. she says i gave you my body. [ __ ] i gave you my dick. it's not like this is a game. and i won right. we both wanted to. have sex here yeah i don't see what the [ __ ] happened i don't see what you thought you know what i'm saying. you know what i'm saying what you guys. did [ __ ] hey oh no okay that that and the part kind of yeah yeah yeah little off track but um [ __ ] yo he's at the end he's just like [ __ ] big up some of ku klux klan yeah. uh though also dude. there's one thing you just gotta reply with. she's like hey uh i gave you my body. and you just say he gave my friend's dad. your body too sayonara. i mean you're out dude. there's no [ __ ] way i mean there's no way i ain't going to. my friend's dad she had sex. with your friend's dad. while they were was it. while they were dating. who cares oh no. that's a big [ __ ] difference not even a little bit you [ __ ] his friend's dad i guess yeah that's insane dude it's pretty cool you're dating somebody. and then she [ __ ] mr marquand. insane dude yeah no that's insane. in [ __ ] insane small town [ __ ] dude you're wearing a bolo tie i'm sherlock holmes so i get you're in a small town because i'm picking up all the [ __ ] different things oh boy man i [ __ ] your exgirlfriend me and a boy okay that's mr marquan talking yeah but um uh no but yeah what is the advice the advice he just wanted to. tell us a little story but the advice. is ow do you gotta get rid of that. girl she's she's true he shouldn't have. she's trump hit it again. no i love when i was like she got a fat ass. like in the middle just this. guy you know i didn't know. if that was a good thing. or a bad thing you meant. it as a good thing. right yeah yeah okay yeah yeah yeah yeah um okay but so you i i need to. get one in your words hit. it again and she i mean. that's not that weird as i hit. it you know i'm just making sure. that everyone knows these are not my words. okay yeah i'm not saying it's out. of control weirdness [ __ ] that's not my word but no but he uh what the [ __ ] is he even seeking here he wants us to. be like well he he at the end. he was like right. [ __ ] oh yeah bro [ __ ] but we're you know i get it dude you both did your thing it's fine it's all good and she said i gave you my body and you say you [ __ ] my dad's friend he didn't say that he said that he should say that i know i know i know you say you [ __ ] my friend's dad gotta go sayonara and jump in the [ __ ] pool what was she she was mad at him for what reason again that she didn't want to. because he didn't want to. date her oh okay. you [ __ ] my friend's dad dude just say did he want to. date you like did my friend's. dad well i don't yeah. i don't wanna the thing. is i know that you're dating. around and i know that you also you're dating. around maybe seeing my friend's dad. so that might not be the greatest. thing because i have to. see my friend's dad a lot. yeah he's 60. yeah but i mean you i don't think you should have. sex with this person or anything. no no you gotta you gotta let god. this is that's it for her. yeah yeah i also anyone that says like i gave you my body. it's like okay but it's sex. like why are you putting it that. way that's a that's a red flag. like that's a i understand. what sex is it sounds like i gave. you my body just wants him. back even from the gym. she's acting out yeah maybe she wanted him. back even when she [ __ ] his friend's dad his friend's dad yeah because the friend wasn't going to. do it you know the friend wasn't going. to do it the friend's. too good of a friend. but the friend's dad is just like oh this. is just one yeah that's where i come. in the friend's like can i [ __ ] your friend no what about hey hey can i have your dad's number it. doesn't i'm way ahead of you. maybe i didn't have a huge boner. maybe he didn't even know i'm way. ahead of you i'm completely erect and you have a fat ass. how shitty is this. guy's dad oh the the what's up. with the dad it's just the dad. needs to get call. in here and ask how to. be a better [ __ ] dude grows up and [ __ ] uh no i don't know i don't want to. imagine that i'm just saying dude. it's not good but i know. no no [ __ ] it's not good. and i'm just like that's where i come. in with a [ __ ] raging boner. yeah no kyle's 25. and [ __ ] yeah and he's he's like dad and i go son it would be his friend too that's so weird. did you see that ass. though son son it's fat now how fat was the ass. damn that's weird [ __ ] am i right you putting it that way makes it sound even weirder it's so [ __ ] weird everyone's weird in this situation yeah and you're the least weird well know that you're [ __ ] weird yeah yeah yeah he's weird but uh you know looking like a [ __ ] mormon sect with that bolo tie he had on yeah all right all right another one that was a good one was it i like it hey chris my question today is about my family uh my mom and my stepdad have been together for 15 years or so [music] i love them both but i've noticed something between them lately. uh my mom is the kind of person. who she gets really defensive. about you calling her out. she can't accept that she's wrong. about anything and lately. i've noticed her being kind of mean. and irritable and snappy towards my stepdad. and he just kind of takes it. yeah you know he's the kind of person. he's been struggling with anxiety. a little bit a little bit of depression. uh and i feel bad because i can just see. her being mean to. him sometimes when i'm over there. he doesn't say anything. about it so i wonder if you think i should confront my mom. about it or not uh. maybe your advice would be helpful. thanks bring it up. he seems like a nice guy. first he's got the wrong voice. for who he is yeah but i think i i actually should sound more. like this maybe he should bring it. up with the stepdad do. you want me to. oh i thought he was insinuating that. the step that does have a problem. with it oh it's i mean. it sounds to me. like maybe he's oblivious to. it but you might be right. i'm just saying but no even if he is aware. of it say you know. i noticed that my mom is. like kind of saying these cutting. things to you i just want to. before i say anything to. her i just want to. like see you how you feel about. that if it's like you guys talk. about it sometimes or like i don't. want to butt. in but like i've started to. notice it and and i feel like saying something. sometimes i just want to. know where you're at with this. you know what i'm saying or you could just approach. you'll be like say your beta. huh and you like and you like that. and you're cool with it okay. because my mom she's walking all. over you because he's a deal. he specifically searches gets defensive. and she's getting defensive. right every time you bring something. up she's like what the heck's your beta. so what are we going. to do about that are you. going to say something. alright all right you could do that. because somebody's going to. say something because we can't let this pitch into. getting out of control okay. if he's if he's saying this about his own. mom and then moon walk out then that means something to. me because that's blood and his stepdad. is ostensibly someone he met. later in life this is his actual mom. so like there must be some [ __ ] shitty stuff that she's saying yep um but i i don't i would recommend. not really getting involved. with the more volatile one. that's why i say maybe i know. but that's his blood though. that's the thing it's like saying it. to the the dad the stepdad. saying i mean it's been 15. years though so that is a long time. okay i missed that. so so maybe you say like yo i've noticed mom. being defensive what do you feel. about that it's not. just defensive though in the in lieu of or after. the defensive [ __ ] yeah she gets increasingly. over the course of days. and weeks gets shitty more cutting. and shitty yeah so so then say i've noticed she's been doing. this have you i you don't want to. go behind your mom's back. but you have known him. for 15 years he's been in your life. yeah so it'd be like how do you feel about. that and she's just like i don't know. it's okay to. be like oh so you're better. are you interesting okay. well that's something and then you talk to. the mom and you'll be like oh it makes me. uncomfortable when you're [ __ ] cutting down my [ __ ] stepdad well if you're going to. say something i'm already pissed. off with you because you gave me the wrong. voice for my body that's the thing. you say to. your mom right make it about you. not like you're sticking up. for the guy yeah you make it about you like that. makes me uncomfortable right when you say mean [ __ ] to. tom or john charisma whatever the [ __ ] [ __ ] i was gonna say that great good job. uh dave and if if you talk to. john charisma that way when i'm around. it makes me uncomfortable steve. windheimer if you talked to. steve wintheimer yeah stephen pinker okay. whatever it is you know. who is it uh he's a making it. i don't know if he's a psychologist or a sociologist. but he's he's famous for okay. well go ahead he wrote he wrote. books uh better angels what is. that what is the name. of that book makko uh he writes about how the world. is in fact not being becoming a worse. place it's becoming a better. safer cleaner more healthy. uh place than it actually has ever been consistently. year after year decade. after decade century by century. making it up [laughter] better. and better and a better place. he's like a [ __ ] professor at harvard he's like yeah yeah we all are so uh all right of our cool. better angels of our nature. there we go that's the worst. [ __ ] title i've ever. heard it's not going anywhere it's not. a good testament i couldn't remember it. you know what's even worse. that that's worse than the [ __ ] the commish. remember that [ __ ] title oh. yeah michael chiklis michael chuck was a. great actor but was in a show. called the commish michael chiklis. has been between the ages. of 40 and 45 for 35. years it's no good dude. from the makers of the lieutenant [laughter]. oh [ __ ] from a secret branch. in the arm and the knave [laughter]. wow i just just finished the goddamn word. [ __ ] abc or whatever the [ __ ] it was the commission and we're gonna call it the commish why not the commissioner because it's cool you know what i mean because it's cooler dude remember when dad made us laugh about that yeah dude i thought we were kids and that's why we thought the title was so funny because my dad was [ __ ] laughing so hard that the show's called the commish dude and then do you know what the joke. was that made us die. you know when you're laughing. really hard and then somebody says the one thing. that sets you over the edge. yeah and you can't breathe. yeah i remember a time. with that for us but go ahead. so he said uh you might as well call it. the vomit oh yeah and and we [ __ ] died i mean i was like five so you're rolling in the vomit. wow that's right the vomit. killed me dude they called. it the vomit dude. that that would be a horror. movie in the 80s the vomit. i mean i'd be much. more likely to. watch the vomit oh yeah yeah remember ours. the time that we laughed so hard. was and you peed you actually peed a little bit because you were laughing. so hard you told me. this oh we were on. the way back from utah. driving and we were listening. to that song and we were making fun. of the song about how the guy was killing. it in the music. yeah we were laughing so hard. and at the end that [ __ ] after the crescendo of the song. it was fading out and the guy. was killing it and he just goes. oh that's [ __ ] right or whatever dude the song the song he kept saying every day every day every day and the very end. he goes every [ __ ] how do you remember that dude. you laughed so hard. so did i but you piss came out. i peed yeah bro the only time i was an adult. i've i've peed my pants. yeah yeah i have diapers that i wear sometimes. in the bed and i try. to piss um that's cause you're lazy. though yep it's not because somebody's making you laugh. i know no i know no i don't laugh. at my sleep like really hard. it would be amazing. that'd be great. i wish that would be so good but um and then so i piss. in my diaper and then it it you can't. do depends is [ __ ] honestly what do you mean. it depends i know what they are. but what do you mean. they're not for heavy peas. and i got the heavy pee ones. that's [ __ ] false advertising. that bro i did a heavy. pee when i got up. dude the whole bed. was so good i mean. we almost had to get a new. mattress man oh crystal i was like oh [ __ ] and i was like i thought they work 40. why didn't you just get up. and pee is what i want. to know because i i i when i get

[ __ ] college try you know yeah i don't like that good builder. the good gen good good geriatric try. are there more videos one. more yeah let's do one. more okay uh only has one more let's do only one more only has one more jake from fort. wayne indiana what's up. um i just had a question. about passion so i can't find anything. that i'm really passionate about. 30 years old i have some hobbies you know i like playing guitar. i like playing piano i taught myself how to. tattoo all night i like reading. books walking my dog all that stuff. right guys but like i'm not actually passionate. about anything oh wow i just i enjoy. doing them but i'm not like enthralled with anything. do you think that it's okay. to go through life without having a passion. and is it or is. it just the fact that i'm not looking hard. enough for it um thanks. so much for doing the podcast. life rips hell yeah. life does rip even. if you don't have a passion yet. he's young he's 30. he's still young he's young. did he say he's 30. uh yeah he's 30. he's still young. in the modern stuff he's like as steven picker. would point out the lifespan of the average. adult human is getting longer and longer so whereas 30 used. to be towards the end of your life. a hundred years ago. now it's still even more. and more and more at the beginning. of your life so unless that's steven pinger will point. out uh thank you better thanks. to john charisma um i think that it's okay. uh to not have a passion. yet but i would start. to be concerned about he said is it. okay to live a life. without passion i i don't i don't. think that that is possible. to be fulfilled if you have no. passion about anything for an entire let's say a fully lived life. to like 78 and then you die. to be passionate about. nothing would be pretty extraordinary and i think not good. do you think it will happen. that's what i'm saying though. yeah ultimately i think you will. run into somebody okay. don't worry about it but keep being curious. and it sounds like he is. he's reading he's doing [ __ ] he's exploring himself. doesn't sound like super young but yeah guys but you don't know. until you try it right. you probably not really really good not. with that so um you know. you have a really good idea. if you'll like that before that's what. i'm saying not about that oh yeah. um uh i okay so i mean this. is why people have kids yeah. yeah i mean this is why. people have kids i don't know. how serious you are with your girlfriend. but that changes but wouldn't you say that. that's the wrong reason to. advocate yeah i would say it's not necessarily the right reason. to have kids but kids can save you like that. i mean like kids. can save your life like that. like your passion yeah danger though. danger oh yeah yeah yeah. well well danger to. assume uh i have no passion i'm bored. i'm yeah yeah i guess. i should have kids i i guess. what that's saying is there's a lot. of stuff to. look forward to you're still young. yes if you want to. have a family there's that. there's also other things like dude. nine of the things you list. [ __ ] seven of the nine of the things you listed. were about music maybe you just don't like [ __ ] playing musical. instruments you know yeah but i try other things find the passion. before you have a family. yeah you could but what if you don't people's passions. are their families well. he's still young i would like to. give yourself another [ __ ] 10 years. get look into. mormonism honestly look into. mormonism read the [ __ ] things of joseph smith the thing pocahontas read. the things of joseph smith and was not a mormon. well whatever yeah no she definitely wasn't because you think of john. smith yep gotta be white what'd i. say joseph smith joseph is the mormon. guy john smith is the guy. who oh yes yes joseph smith discovered the new. world are they with their brothers no what.

team. yeah okay no i don't know. is it everyone is right. adam and eve smith certainly technically everyone is related. there we go and that's what stephen. pinkerton says john charisma i think that

know yeah yeah well that's pretty much all the same. thing all right let's talk. about the housing market wow. 30. uh my wife and i are trying. to buy our first house. nice and um the market's. just terrible we moved into. the inlaw suite of my parents house about two years ago save money for a house and wedding while we're married now we've got a bunch of money saved up we're preapproved for way more than we should ever spend but everything on the market is listed for double what it lasts sold for and uh we really don't want to. do that we looked at a fixerupper. last night that it. was 215 thousand dollars um and the realtors probably. said we should offer 240 if we want to. have a fighting game. so yeah like 240 for fixerupper. is ridiculous yeah i want to. let you want to. see what you guys think. um and this is my work van. all right i'm sure chris has already mentioned it. what the [ __ ] this guy in a coffin so anyways cool. that's what a work van. looks like chris thanks guys yeah. i wouldn't know so uh yeah. dude the [ __ ] housing market is insane. yeah it's really really stupid. it's insane i it can't be like this. for for too much longer depending no. it's it's gonna it's slowing down. right now already it is. very very top of the market. is is really slowing down. really really really fast right. and drastically but that that's the very top. of the market yeah not right that's anyone. that we yeah yeah so and that'll trigger. but that's yeah exactly yeah circle. now i i know that. from ronald reagan okay. trickle down economic can. you tell you that uh yeah i don't know. something back then but he um yeah dude. you gotta wait bro. you're you're in a nice spot. i know you don't want to. be with the [ __ ] inlaw is it the inlaws or you're you're paranoid. but absolutely oh god okay. so too many [ __ ] releases yeah definitely um yeah i think i you got to. wait you're in a position now. where you can wait. i think you should wait. it's just too much i know. you want because here's the other thing. too don't get a fixerupper. and this is why you don't get a fixerupper. because you're what do you say. is 30 30. dude this may not be your dream. house and that's okay this may not be your dream. house and that may be okay because you'll you can get that. you have plenty of time. to do that so right. now what you don't want to. do is blow a bunch. of cash that you don't have to. when you could wait. another year and then [ __ ] blow less cash and then have more cash for either fixing [ __ ] up or also your dream. house later i wish she said where he was though yeah i mean that makes a big difference because sometimes depending upon the area. a place like sometimes some markets. just actually don't go down. they stagnate and go. up slower than other. times like in the last two. three years the la housing market has been just like straight up going like my [ __ ] boner like my boner. just straight up nope or whatever. but now when the l.a market starts to. go like this yeah dude. like you're both it'll be like still up. but not as much so shut the [ __ ] up um i hope you do understand. so uh they market like this is like right. now like for me. i'm not gonna say it. for the world worst housing expert housing expert but depending upon. where you are what's going. to happen is we're going. to get down to. maths level whereas some markets. just i'm not going to. say that actually might go down. at some point and you don't want to. spend too much money. in a place that is never going. to ever reach that level. again so like if he's in a market. that is constantly getting like western beach. it wouldn't matter but if you're in a market. that like who the [ __ ] would generally in normal. times want to buy a house. there and you're spending over. asking that's a [ __ ] bad idea oh so west palm. beach is not what you're saying. because yeah he's always [ __ ] bonerlike. so but if he's in west palm. beach then you might want. to spend over because you're never going. to really yeah right. because the bonus is not going. to get stronger you're going. to make less money. right shut up about boners. where's john charisma when you [ __ ] need him dude so um yeah but he's not he's pro let's assume he's not in one of those places. those places are not the majority. john charisma no no no no no [ __ ] new york. la west palm beach vancouver boner. city probably atlanta to. places that are always growing. my boner city other. places match bonuses san francisco. those places are always on. the up me other like you know. okay omaha okay okay oh absolutely. so bad at breaking it. down for people too. so they understand that oh you're you're a boner. okay acronym this is your bunner. on acro okay. okay look so what's your advice. for the guy um go to. a place where that's more like your boner. where at the [ __ ] market is going. to be a little bit more. like my boner a little bit. later no go to a place that is going. up up always so that if here's the deal. if you really want to. get the [ __ ] out of there then go to. a place where the market is never really going to. be depressed or crashed. but also if you're in a place that isn't like that. and you're unwilling to. look at a place. that is like that then absolutely wait. and wait till your money. can go further can go longer. it can really stretch but you don't want to. get a fixerupper you don't. you don't want to. max out and get a fixerupper. because where the [ __ ] are you going to. get the money to. fix it up right. right right if you're going to. go over and max the [ __ ] out you have to. be getting your dream house. already yeah yeah okay yeah you're right. you're right dude but wait it. out a little bit for the most part. because it's crazy right. now everything's on yeah unless you can get your dream. house for the 240 or whatever yeah good points. point all right cool um all right well you know
