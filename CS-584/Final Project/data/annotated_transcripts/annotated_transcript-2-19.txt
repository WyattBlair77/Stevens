[ __ ] hundred however old he is 80. 17. and he just that's it. dude god and also what's the deal. with al pacino doing it. like people are always like hey al pacino is. just like there they mix up. al pacino and robert de niro you know and then al pacino and then robert de niro. he did it he's gonna have. a kid again right. oh yeah oh yeah and then he goes all. right and then i'll put you know

straight up splurts just all right all right i'm all done oh yeah and then and then uh they are gonna have kid dude they're gonna those kids are gonna grow up they're gonna meet each other. one day and they're just gonna be like yeah you know. i know all right the kids. can be like all right. i just uh he's 83 years. old and robert de niro. is oh wow al pacino. asked alf a girlfriend noor. alfala to take dna. test or because i know. i'm not the only one you've been you know. i know i'm the only one right. um uh yeah so i don't know. if you're 80 something though. and you it actually i will say this. dude um if you're you thought he could no longer. have children and then that chick. was like let's see what's up. though if you're 80. something and you're wearing condoms oh here's the deal. it's very um it's very responsible. to wear condoms if you're over. 80. i mean you know we know. they don't because they're like [ __ ] it i'm gonna be dead. and i wanna and i want to. be really feeling all that. stuff right that's what that's what old dudes. think probably i don't know. 80 but they're probably like yeah. like that's where they say. like herpes and like all of the crazy. stds are rampant in like retirement. communities because like why would they be cheating right because they want to. feel all that right. they want to. literally feel all that and have it. just be like isn't that amazing. you know what i mean. and um and so but also it's very irresponsible right. because you don't want to. have a kid that grows. up without a father right. i don't i wouldn't do that. because you know now that i know. what it's like to. be a father there's just zero. way i mean i gotta be around. i started working out again. like harder because i want. to be able to. like keep fit for my children. and that's straight up you know. now i don't say this. a lot but that's on god. you know and don't believe in god. i don't even know right. but like that's on god. right so yeah i can't imagine just straight up being 82 because when that. baby comes out you're gonna want. to have that oh i want to. be here i would go. i would tail spin dude. i would just have a tailspin i would spin out. that that's my son or daughter now. isn't going to be able. to and i just gotta i got a few more. oh yeahs left in me. and that's it and she's gonna have to. watch you know she's gonna have to. grow up and just know me. from uh the [ __ ] dog day afternoon movie that's your dad really yep was he four six you look so short in that movie but he maybe he is i don't know i met him once i met al pacino once. and he was awesome. he walked in the room. and he was just like hi. um and i was like eh. pacino um so yeah dude i don't know and the nero just was denier how old is de niro. 79 okay so yeah i guess. you could be around. for another 20 years but still i mean. 79 89.99 i mean by the time. you're 85 you're just oh dude. i can't even imagine being 85. even. now i'm like my patients are. being worked all the time. right dude someone was in line. the other day i went to. this place because i ate good chicken. from it and i and i go like this. the next day i like you know what dude. i want that chicken again. so i go and i park. in the 15 minute. slot because i'm just gonna go pick. up the chicken and come back. and the 15 minute. slots really easy to. get to so i parked there. and i go wait in line. for the chicken the line. 25 minutes so already i'm like okay. they're working my last nerve. i am next now and the people in front of me. is two women and the guy and it they did. the thing where like they're in the line. and i'm waiting and uh and then other people their friends were coming. up and saying [ __ ] and i'm like are you all ordering for. them like let's go i need to. know what i'm getting into. what kind of line i'm getting. into right but i'm 43. so i'm like not you know. my point is like my pages. are already worth then. period i'm at point at at jump. my patients are already like all. right what's going on here. though hold on right. no matter what's about. to happen i uh right. so the people are in front of me. and and and the line now here's why i tell you the lines. 25 minutes not even because i you know i'm not even trying. to tell you that like that's a long. time for me i'm trying. to tell you the lights. 25 minutes when you get there. that's a wrap you go. i want this i want this i want this. i want this thank you. here's my car have it. out i got my card bing there we go boom. these people walk up uh this [ __ ] already no have already read. it have yourself a read. already before you get up. there also the there's like nine things. on the thing and you're just getting a chicken. right it's a chicken place. you can get a salad. with chicken on it you get a chicken. i don't even look at the thing. you get a here's what i know. you can get a salad. with chicken on it a chicken. sandwich or or a chicken. that's what you can get and even. if you don't look at the sign. know yourself know yourself you know. what you like even if you want chicken. parmesan which they're probably not. gonna have because it's

be like do you have steak. no it's a chicken place. okay these people are like do i now. does it cut now does. the if i get it. does it have the what. read it and do the things come with the thing.

everybody. at home this this and this and this and this is that. it yup put the [ __ ] card in took it out sign the thing miles done dude that was it then it took another 25. minutes from 50 minutes. dude it's a new place. but get your [ __ ] together right. 50 minutes ah and they had and also in the window. it's one of those places. that shows the chickens turning. which i don't i sorry. i don't want to. see it first of all second of all. they had 900 chickens cut it. up cut it up serve. it so anyway my point. is when i'm 82 holy. [ __ ] that's what i kind of get when you're 82 i get the impetus to. not use condoms because you're like i waited. so long for i got no. time left and i waited 50 minutes for [ __ ] chicken. i'm not wearing a rubber i needed to. make the most of this while i'm alive. and i hope my son. or daughter whoever comes. out i hope they get it. because if they don't they will by the time. they're 80. oh i get it. they go um so yeah dude. i was in the uh so my wife. is the default parent right. which she i don't know. what that is but i'm assuming it means that i don't. even know if i let me hold. on let me look up. what a [ __ ] default parent. is default parent she she's like always home. or something a diva parent. typically the one who's first in. line when it comes to. caring for children charlie to. talk to us yeah well okay. i guess but i don't really agree. with this because it all depends on what the [ __ ] happens. you know william yeah he's real. young really all he does. is drink that milk you know. what i mean it's not coming. from me so yeah. she's the default parent but if cow. slips and falls and bonks his head. he runs and hugs me he might run. and hug her too but we know what it. means default parent okay but so she's i guess i don't like that term because i think you know we're at we're at nintendo. world and calvin wants to. jump on my shoulders right. so who's the default. parent there okay but my anyway so she says she's the default. parent because this woman uh amber thornton created. a term they'd be creating. terms man i'll tell you that much and um so my wife is doing a lot. of the uh you know. hey william drink this. which is an alltime it's on all. con it's a get it. that's tough i i can't. imagine having a part of my body. that like another being had to. had to like depend. on to live i would i mean. i would just be like i can't. even win line for [ __ ] chicken you know so the dogs i guess on the lower level of my house on the bottom level the lowest level. i'll say lower sounds like i have two levels. i have more than i have three left. i'm not even okay but it's the truth. my dogs just threw the [ __ ] up two of them like like they went there to. do it like they were like they're in like ibiza. and it's [ __ ] 3am and i say ibiza so my dogs. went down to. ibiza and just go a bit. and then ran back up. stunk to how i have and my wife. takes some paper towels and just puts. them on there like didn't wipe it. up she just put it on to. where you throw it down. and then you see the the liquid. to throw up just kind of over. the towel like that disgusting. [ __ ] we're like oh wow there's actually a lot more than i thought so it's there for a day. okay and by the way i'm with my wife. on this i i don't i'm not calling her. out i think that's amazing. dude keep that [ __ ] there till you till you know what till you wanna. pick it up i don't give a [ __ ] i walk by it like three times. i don't care it's covered. we good okay so it's there. for a day i think i might have been there. for two days i have no [ __ ] idea not more than two days but there's dog throw up on my lowest level. and the [ __ ] towels are over it. with the you know with the with the disgusting. you could see it was beijing. so my wife i'm i'm breezing past. it for a day and a half. okay my wife says hey the doctor's coming. because we gotta test we gotta see. if calvin's a little bit under the weather. um and i'm like this is unnecessary. he's got the sniffles. like it's fine but whatever. if it's rsv which is a bad thing. for a very very young. child to get then he has it. then he could give it to. william and then that's bad right. so the doctor comes to test. him it's fine she puts. the swab up his nose. but before that uh she says hey can you go. clean up the the throw up because the doctor's coming and i was like yeah. even though i don't want to. get it's all good right. because i guess i mean dr. c throw up all the time. right they're doctors but she cheated as a woman. my my wife doesn't want another woman. because she has a dirty house. and i get that so in a way. it's like you do it. but also i'll do it. right because you're the default. parent you gotta feed. william so i go down. there i go i don't i don't go. i go with an extra little piece of bounty. [ __ ] i go down i go to. wipe it up dude. hey oh it was only a little throw up. stop the cap dude it was a mountain. of hard used to. be gelatinous brown something okay hey and it didn't smell. bad stop the cow dude. i couldn't he was looking at the cartoons the bad. smell and it went like this. like with the smoke. and i go and i say i go i look at my little paper. towel and i said oh babe. it's way worse than i thought. i can't i got him. i'm gonna take dish. towels i'm gonna get dish towels [ __ ] it yeah cause i could just do this with a fl a few kleenex so i got dish. towels i take the dish towels and in a way. i'm bringing the dish. towels downstairs and i'm like i hope it. cleans it up but in a way. i'm like oh it just kind of ruins. the dish towels right because it should have been done. already she she just laid. the [ __ ] on there which i'm with her and i get it and i would have done the same thing. but still ah and away because i'm a piece of [ __ ] i'm like i hope this ruins. your [ __ ] dish towels and i hope i got the good ones i don't even know what the good. ones are i hope these are the ones. you like i hope they're staying beige all. the time though forever. so i go and i got also here's the thing. i look under the sink. like what can i clean. this with because i need it d. grimer i don't even know. what i picked i picked something and it this. is what my cleaning ladies. do dude they [ __ ] take bottles of [ __ ] when they empty out they fill it with other [ __ ] and put tape over it and then write a new thing they just like write what it's for kitchen. so i'm like oh dude. what is this [ __ ] i have no idea it's not the kitchen. but still i'm like look kitchen. the spray that you're using the kitchen. some it's got to. be some dope [ __ ] because it's what it's food. it's got to. get the real grime the degreaser you got to. get the [ __ ] you got to. get the [ __ ] inside the oven. so i take it spray. it great it worked dish. towel scooped it up amazing. isn't that amazing so i go. to take god damn dude. this is just great on our second level. on our midlevel we have two. baskets now are they big. enough of course not why. because they need to. look good and i'm like function. over form or function over beauty whatever the [ __ ] uh uh but she's like yeah but the little baskets are cute. and i'm like yeah but what are they for. she's like clothes but i'm like yeah. but that's one sweater for me. right so that's amazing. right isn't that amazing. so there's two of them. she says this one. this is a month ago. this one is for dirty. clothes and this other one. is for anything we need to. bring upstairs now they're both. too small so i'm like the [ __ ] we need to. bring upstairs cute tips. two weeks ago. we had a conversation where i say. you know what that basket. for our clothes is too. small it's about one. sweat one and a half sweater. worth my wife says yeah so i'm like all. right in my head now. i went beyond the conversation. which we do sometimes. i i'ma put the dirty clothes. in both the baskets right. [ __ ] it i didn't even remember i did this so what i did was took the dishcloths threw them in one of the baskets i didn't know which one but it didn't matter. because they're all for clothes now. and they both had clothes in them. so i was like my wife's on board. with my plan that i made up. in my head now about 10. minutes before this podcast. starts my wife says what the [ __ ] my wife. basically is just looking down. at the [ __ ] basket and i say huh. and she said are you kidding. me you did this and i'm like the right. thing is this a joke. i did what you asked. and i put the [ __ ] thing away. in the baskets and she said you ruined. my new clothes and i said. huh and she said i put my new clothes. in the basket to. bring upstairs basket and you put these dish. towels full of throw up in that. basket and i said yeah. because i want to. wash it he said you can't. put all these chunks to. throw up in the thing. and you're gonna [ __ ] up my new clothes. i said new clothes. why are you washing your new. clothes she says i'm not just to. bring upstairs basket so i'm like what. too many rules. i thought i did the right. thing so here's my question. to you guys she said. go on your podcast and ask these [ __ ] she didn't say [ __ ] that's me but in the comments is it okay to. put taking disregarding the basket. i put in the wrong basket. i guess okay but disregarding that is it. okay to put uh towels you took. clean throw up in and put it in the regular hamper. is that okay yes or no. because she says no and i say you're gonna watch the whole. [ __ ] thing anyway i didn't really [ __ ] how about that i didn't run [ __ ] so i'm just like it's not a problem um but yeah you'll be doing that kind of [ __ ] too right just getting by as a [ __ ] husband or a boyfriend or a man that lives with a woman you're just you're just beginning by right how did you gay guys do it because guys don't want to. do [ __ ] two gay guys are just like ah i'll get to. it you know guys but i don't think that's the straight. male thing right can you do. the thing like do gay. guys are they like can you do. you mind this or like jesus. one of the best things. about being gay is you probably. don't have to. do any chores you know. you're just honestly [ __ ] right it's pride so that's kind of it. it's pride uh in uh everywhere. i guess pride month. is every three months. i think and i i feel like maybe i feel this. honestly because i just i live in la and it's pretty. [ __ ] gay here and that's fine. i love it i think i think all dudes should [ __ ] dudes straight up i wish i could do it. but it's like you know bungee. jumping for me i just kind of i don't want. to you know um but if i did i would do it. dude like you know i would do it. and i would do it a lot. man like i i i i think all men should should absolutely. [ __ ] other men so if you're thinking about it get into. that but like um it's so uh it's very pride right. now and i was at dinner. with my wife and like we tried. to drive a [ __ ] home and everything was blocked off and there's not even a parade. happening right now right. or is i don't even know i i think honestly like more than five gay. guys walking around is a parade. because they're just so parady. you know you know they don't just walk they like do. it like that so i got out. of my car to. go to dinner and a dude. in a speedo walked by. just like super gay. and that's all good i think most guys. should do that straight or gay. but i here's my problem. with the whole thing okay. is that we got back. in the car after dinner went home. and everything was blocked off. i couldn't drive my regular route. i had to keep making uturns just because guys [ __ ] other guys and it's like that. makes no sense i want to. go you know where i want to. go that way but i can't because guys [ __ ] other guys do it [ __ ] other guys like i said i think all guys should [ __ ] other guys but i want to. go the roots i go. like if i was gay. i swear to. god i'd be like ah pride month. it is so it's can i just [ __ ] guys in peace dude. i gotta be all i gotta be all open. in my window hollering out about it. you know let me just suck. some you know let me just suck. quietly did you like that yeah. all right cool just it's fine. if you tell people but just don't be all like singing. about it you know. i i i i and then i was like driving past. a trash can and it said don't litter glitter. and it was like ah that's litter though. right what's the most number oneiest. thing that's litter glitter glitters. everywhere always hey look down. you got glitter on you. because some [ __ ] wore glitter. in [ __ ] 2007. right that you walk by that [ __ ] doesn't go away um so i can't drive certain places and it's super gay and that's all good um i don't even think it should be gay to.

[ __ ] nintendo land um we get in dude. and it's first of all it's too. crowded right too crowded. it's too hot and it's too. crowded it's too. loud everybody there is ugly. shape up everyone huh do squats. everyone right now do squats. ten you know what i'm saying. anyway dude it's cool it's all good. and it's just like but we were there. bro they killed it. it looks nice right it looks real. nice and uh my son. holy [ __ ] he was just he loves uh bowser and the plants. that come out of the tunnels and uh whatever the warp the [ __ ] tunnel. warps and there were plenty of those you didn't want. to go to bowser's castle. because it looked a little bit scary. um we saw mario and luigi and he loved. he was just watching it. and then do it there was a line. for getting a picture with marion. luther was insane then they say oh princess. peach is coming out everyone i look. over the line is out to. [ __ ] it's like the line in russia. for bread in 1982. and um and so princess. peach comes out in her and the costumes they have now are like legit. it's not like just some like doofy.
