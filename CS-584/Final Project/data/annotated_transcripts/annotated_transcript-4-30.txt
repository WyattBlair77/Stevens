[ __ ] 100 miles an hour on flex. avenue because i'll tell you what dude. last time it was [ __ ] because last time we were just skating on pipes and now we're swinging through. the jungle hikes pipes. who thinks that someone even if i said pikes who wouldn't know that. i meant pipes in that. situation shook up your words. quite often so i like finding you in the [ __ ] ups i do hot. what we have fun i'm not garbage. at this game dude. i'm really not i'm just 41. and i don't you know. don't play it okay. that means you're garbage. at it no hold on. babe we have to. do it together okay let me tell you what to. do okay okay so it starts. this game honestly starts with listening to. me well how to. listen i spend my whole. day doing that just listening to. you you're disintegrating oh okay. so you were looking at me. and you jumped off you jumped. to your dad look around. first what you're going to. want to do is look. around look around okay now what you're going. to want to. do is wait you see. that little coil thing on the thing. you're going to want. to jump and dash. and then hit r1 because it's far. away jump jump dash r1 all right. okay jump dash r1 there. we go now let it go. and we're golden dude. now you're close to. me you're closer to. me keep it moving keep. it moving keep it moving keep there. i am there we are look. at that we love each other in this. game okay i wore the nasa shirt. in honor of in honor. of the richest guy you. don't have to. ever do something in honor. to the richest more like a space. thing happens so i wore. my space shirt it's way. different i think i flew a [ __ ] big [ __ ] to. the moon why are there bottoms so hefty. they're squirrels you know. they look like pears they're scored. of course parents repairs when they stand up. that's not the weird part the weird. part is they have no [ __ ] no the weird part. is that you're looking at a squirrel's. [ __ ] expecting i looked at the [ __ ] area because you were saying why are they so hefty on the bottom so i looked and they have no no no no no genitalia which is weird and then also no nuts which is crazy weird. for squirrels because squirrels have. nuts in their hands in between. their legs and also in their in their mouths. the squirrel nut thing. is about the nuts. that they eat and berry not the ones. i know squirrels have always at least. two nuts and then also sometimes one. more not in their mouth. you know what i'm saying actually. if a squirrel had always has two nuts. and then also could it even have one. more nut in their mouth. and i don't mean it. it sounds gross but i don't mean. i don't mean it to. be gross are you having a stroke.
