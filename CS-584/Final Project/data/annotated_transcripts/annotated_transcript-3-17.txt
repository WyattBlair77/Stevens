inside of the center. of me i believe it. too the faith i. have in me getting to. that guy today not so good. maybe you have that faith. could i possibly be my grown self. today could i possibly pick. up the miso today. i got there i asked the guy. where the [ __ ] what what's queso. fresca what is it dude. i said what is it. is that what it was. babe queso fresca fresco. what okay so fresco. it's male it's got a dick. dude so i [ __ ] uh i i said what's queso fresco. because i can't find it. baby yes i looked at the cheese. i looked at the [ __ ] i don't even. know what the dairy you know. so i finally asked the guy. where's the queso fresco and well i asked her she said it's in this is the most white [ __ ] i don't even know if it's true it's in the mexican freezer. of the [ __ ] of the of the grocery. store and i'm like they divided. based off of like what isn't there. just freezer she goes ask. an attendant or whatever the [ __ ] they call. a grocer and uh and ask ask them. where the queso fresco is. now look i don't know. what it is so i asked and i look for a little bit. i'm starting i get pissed. i look i asked the i go. as far as i go. do you understand i i go. as far as you know. how people you know how far i go. one mile right. you know people go the extra. mile i don't do that i go. one mile when people say. hey how many miles do you go to. get the job done. i'm already right there like this. i go one mile. those [ __ ] [ __ ] i will look 500 miles and i will walk 500 more dude me i will walk one mile and i won't walk another mile i walk only one mile. and not one step more. than linda linden um so yeah so i you know that here's what the extra mile. is on that expedition i i look for the queso. fresco fresco whatever the [ __ ] it's called i asked the grocer the grocer points. to where it is he walks. me over grocer's always so [ __ ] nice right grow all grocers i've ever been to. and talked with they will like literally walk here. hey come here let me. show you did i had a grocery. once walk out of shoprite and walk into. another grocery store or. grocery store come here. it's over here we don't have. it but here come here. hop in here kick put the seatbelt. on here get out. they have it here you go. there it is greek yogurt. we don't have it there. you go i'll walk back. take the car home horses. are nice as [ __ ] dude. so i'm like all i got to. do i know is ask where queso. fresco what is it what is it called. crazy scope fresco is. i'm like foghorn leghorn over. here okay okay uh fresco fresco. and uh she'll say where's the queso. fresco and he goes like this and i'm like see here's the thing too when you ask a grocery. store person what do you call. them grocers what what do you where's the first of all i never know who's the actual real person. to ask for this. [ __ ] because you got two people you got the people who ring you up and the people who work in the back. and sometimes those people who work in the back. come up and box. stuff and i'm like i guess i'll ask them. if they box if they unbox this but i don't know is that a real person. but here's the [ __ ] twist this is like the m night shyamalan movie. of it all the people. who work the checkout. they're also the people who work in the back. so everybody who's a girl says the same. [ __ ] job didn't know that till recently i mean yeah work in the line might be your specialty but it's all the same because they wear different [ __ ] sometimes right they have the apron on if they're dealing with meats or fish or yams or whatever the [ __ ] or queso fresco so like we're the case of fresco and i ask. him near the dairy. [ __ ] so i'm like he'll probably just be like right here if not he'll walk me over to. the thing so he goes like this. ah so i'm like this guy doesn't even. know he's standing next to. the dairy shits so he goes like it should be here. um here look here come. here and he walks over. and i'm walking with him. and he goes like this. here's where all the cheese. is and i go not what i uh in my head. i'm like not what i asked. so i say that's where that. mile stops i say okay i don't go. the extra mile. because i asked the grocer where the [ __ ] was he walked and he pointed. and he said over here. and i go okay. i don't do the extra mile. which is can you show me. where specifically because that's too much. the transaction is over you pointed. where it is [laughter]. so now it's up. to me and i'm looking i see every cheese. except for queso fresco. and i do it for like 12. minutes and i'm looking and i'm so pissed. and a fan comes. by and gives me a very nice. compliment and i they say oh thank you very much and she walks away. and i feel good but i'm also i'm like i hope. i wasn't a dick. i'm really just looking for. this kid so fresco. i don't want her to. think i was in a dick. i hope she comes back. and i could be like thank you. again so she knows. i'm a nice person and i don't find. it but i do find [ __ ] cheese that is uh a blend it's like a a triblend of mexican. cheese i'm like that sounds queso. fresco she said the mexican. thing and then them and then fresco's mexican. and so i'm getting the mexican. tried cheese [ __ ] and i'm getting. it i'm getting a whole bag. of it i get like it's like four. pounds i almost gotta throw it. over my shoulder and i get here and she's like and i was like i didn't get the queso. fresco i want you to. understand that this is what i got and it's mexican. it's fine it's gonna be fine. because i looked up what you put queso. fresco on and it's like i saw that [ __ ] and when i and and i don't like that like like white powdery cheese so i think i actually did a good job not in the case of fresco i got the real [ __ ] that we should have got so it's fine i did some ingenuity [ __ ] that's not the extra mile i did not go the extra mile but i did some enrichment on it right so she's like that's totally fine but this bag is so big and i'm like what you're not gonna do is talk about the good [ __ ] i did like it's a bad thing too much cheese is also the right amount of cheese but she's my angel right and this is a comedy podcast she didn't complain but i am now so i go you're welcome but you got too much cheese you welcome right so she's making dinner now and i can't wait to. [ __ ] eat that chicken bowl dude. can't wait to. eat that chicken ball dude. she made beef stew the other night. man and she just kind of got on this. cooking kick and i ate that. beef stew dude it. was so good and i'm like not even. a beef stew guy. you understand yeah it had rice. in it and rice. is my [ __ ] dude but we put that [ __ ] beef stew on that rice and just made it and [ __ ] all oh my god dude i'm just like maybe i'm a beef stew guy now but i'm not but it was so good and i say uh nothing like a home home cooked meal and she's like yeah you i would cook more uh i just i forget how much i like it it's just the setup and the deconstructing part that i don't like and i was like yeah and that's why the dishes were in the dish. the sink for a full day. and i didn't do my duties. because i didn't want to. do it because sometimes the pots are too. big and i can only fit like one. in the dishwasher and so i got to. do like i got to. do it multiple times and it's really [ __ ] annoying and it's all good i did my part. i did the dishes before. i did the podcast and it's fine. but let me tell you something. right now dude thank you because i was having like a weird. day and i just mean on my insides. i don't even mean outwardly. i don't mean with people i wasn't getting. into any arguments i was just in my head. mentally and i was feeling a bit of anxiety. and i go i literally thought i can't wait till i do. my podcast because i know that. that's gonna fix it. and get me distracted and sure. enough baby sure enough. it did and i thank you. guys for that because you're here. for me and you're just as important. as as important as i am for. this podcast even though i'm just saying that. because mostly i'm more important. because i'm the one actually doing the podcast. [music] it's loud by design i made it louder. it might be leveled out. when we don't do one. but it was loud. in my earphones and but yeah dude. we love it come see. me in boston november 12th um i uh i like watching. horror movies you know. i like thrillers the most. those are my favorite type of movies. and you know i go on apple. sometimes i see the movies. i could rent sometimes i go. on amazon prime and i see the [ __ ] bad movies i can watch that like eric roberts. were in in 1990. and if he's got a machine. gun i mean dude if i see a movie and the cover is eric. roberts and he's holding some sort of gun dude try to. get me not to. click on that and sit down for two. hours just try the bigger. the gun the quicker. the click um so i'm surfing around. with my friend david sullivan. he's the one who has the andrew jackson here. by the way it gets recognized. from the vlogs we do on. tour report and if you go to. my chris lea channel. and subscribe like and subscribe. by the way like and subscribe. here guys uh we're still stuck. at 596 and uh we're trying to. you know there's a conspiracy. going on keeping us keeping us. thwarted but so i'm searching around on the apple [ __ ] and i see this movie and it's called now if you've seen this movie you know where this is going but you probably have not seen this movie okay it's called speak no evil i look at the cover it's just like a a sunset and there's like shadowy figures in the distance. and i'm like huh. what's this about so i google. it let me google. it because i wanna wait no. what not see no evil. speak no evils right. speak no evil um a day. and i read a danish. family now i'm i'm already hooked because those danes dude. the danish fit the danish. people just already i mean. because it's if this is a thriller. i love it because danish people. you don't really think about them. being okay so okay but maybe they're extra weird. with the okay a danish family. visits a dutch family and then i go. oh okay in this. case two weirds connect. [music] okay lock it throw it away. to get out of the room. i gotta call that. guy who's talking about white dudes. in jail taking it up. the anus so i am locked in this. room with the idea of a danish. family going to visit a dutch family. and i think that this is a thriller. so i go david found it. and he goes what man. he was probably sleeping because he's always [ __ ] tired or eating and i read the rest of the synopsis. i say read this. a daniel family visits a dutch. family they met on a holiday what was supposed. to be now that's where i'm cemented. if i see the what was supposed. to be in a title. i know [ __ ] goes wrong in a movie. i know i thought one thing. and not only did i think one. thing but the people in the movie. thought one thing and i know something. crazy is about to. happen but the people in the movie. don't and i'm a step. ahead of the people in the movie. i know some secrets right. so it says what was supposed. to be an idyllic weekend. slowly starts unraveling as the danes. start uh as the danes try to. stay and i gotta click. on the thing god damn. it um as the danes tried to. stay polite in the face of unpleasantness. dude and i'm just like but a thriller. i go like this so this. movie is about people danish. people this is the tagline. this is the synopsis they. chose the danes try to. stay polite in the face of unpleasantness. they didn't say during this. harrowing adventure they didn't say. from the duchess terrifying them. they said they try to. stay polite in the face of unpleasantness. now what is unpleasantness now i'm thinking what are the things. that are unpleasant bad breath. uh you know um nausea. a windows open and it's too cold. and you don't want to. get up to close. it right and i'm like that doesn't sound so great. to watch a movie about but this is in the thriller. category so i'm hooked dude. now you got it dane a dutch and two americans. sitting pretty dude from jump. so i turn it on and when i tell you now. i'm watching a movie this. is what the movie's about. and i'm not gonna ruin this. movie for you because i guess this is in a way. me reviewing this movie and i think this is an important. thing to talk about on. the podcast i know it's not. just another movie review but i'm watching the movie. and it starts with this. tone of terror right. and what i mean by. that is it's just showing a guy. at a pool with his wife. and another guy shows up at the resort. and says hey our it points. to the chair with the guy's. stuff on it and says can i uh use this. chair you're using it and the guy. goes like this uh uh yeah you know what uh yeah. okay and take this stuff. off gives the guy the chair. now he obviously didn't want to. do it but he was being polite. and and that's just something. that we all deal with. so i go like this. oh i'm in this movie. in a way but the music. and the score is music. and score that would be in a horror. movie so i'm like but a thriller though guys is asking him. for his chair dude. when i and if you're a fan. of mine you know if i see some [ __ ] like this i'm all in dude. right the movie continues for an hour. and a half and it's just this. kind of [ __ ] that happens. for an hour and 20. minutes like the girl says she's a vegetarian. and they invite them. to hang out with them. later on in the year. and they stay at this. cabin with them on holiday and they're like the first thing. they do is like you got to. try this board and she's like no that's okay. and he's like nah try it. try it and you basically like you know. it's a suggestion but he's like kind of force it. he's like okay and she eats it. and and this happened for an hour. and a half these weird. things that are happening with the [ __ ] music that would be in like you know sicario not a horror movie. but like you know like that [ __ ] and i look. over to david like 40. minutes in and i say to. him and i'm on the edge. of my seat i say to. him i was like why. is this so how is this terrifying. nothing is happening and i'm like scared. and he goes like this. boy i don't know man. it's just really unnerving you know. and i was like it is unnerving he says really unnerving man. and we keep saying it. for the next that's unnerving man. really unnerving i'm like it is unnerving isn't it. and i sit and it's an hour. in the movie and i go. like this this movie i hope it. holds up through the end. because this movie is if this keeps going. it's a masterpiece and i'm not dude. i don't say movies. or songs or [ __ ] or masterpieces i am. so hooked up on this. movie and it's so good and i relate. to it so much. but also it's terrifying. and they're just chilling. i don't get it now. i'm not ruining this movie. but an hour and 30. minutes into the movie. something happens in the movie. that's a scene and it is the most and i say this. not lightly it is the most horrific. thing i have ever seen in. cinema it is so i i dare to. say traumatizing it's so bad. for me i'm 42. people get trauma. when they're like four i think it traumatized me. i'm 42. and i go like this. yo david hey david tell me what happens. i'm out for about a minute. and a half and he's watching it. he stands up puts. his hanger on his head. he goes oh no man. oh no and i say what's happening. and he says exactly what you think's. happening man and i say i actually don't think it's happening. because no movie would ever. have this happening and he says well it's happening. man and he sits. down and i look at his face. before i see the movie and i look and his face. is even whiter than it. [ __ ] is normally and he's from [ __ ] texas and i say are you kidding me i have trauma now we rode out to. the end of the movie and i did. not watch the part that i turned my head. in and at the end also something. at the end to. end something really weird. happens too that i had to. turn my head for a little bit but my point. is this i get mad. i get mad at this. movie because i'm like man i was watching this. whole thing and i was into. it and i don't want to. have to see this horrific. thing i'm a dad now. i can't watch this [ __ ] and i'm mad. and then i realize i'm mad because what the [ __ ] man. these people who are going through. all this weird [ __ ] that should have just [ __ ] said something they should have left the [ __ ] house but i wasn't you know being like a black person in the movie theater like no don't go in there i was keeping it inside and if they just said something i wouldn't [ __ ] have to. see that [ __ ] and i'm just so invested man. and maybe black people have it. right dude because they're saying this. [ __ ] and these people got into. this predicament because they weren't saying [ __ ] they just let [ __ ] happen and keep happening and that's why this movie is this [ __ ] most terrifying movie i've ever seen because these people didn't didn't do what they know they should have done dude and for that reason this movie is still one of the best movies i've ever seen in my entire life i will say that one scene is so horrific that i wish. i didn't see the movie that's how that's how horrific that. scene is and this is how good the movie. is and [ __ ] man kristen taft drop the director of this movie you are one [ __ ] up dude and you know it and you know it because you made two other movies i don't have a [ __ ] extremely [ __ ] up online and i watched another one too because of my ocd i had to. watch the next one the next day. and it's called a horrible. woman and obviously you have so different. shares but i have to. watch it because you know what i [ __ ] love that movie i need another one parents. it's called parents and these parents. go and they're [ __ ] whatever you [ __ ] look it up but that's the scariest thing in life is not saying and doing the [ __ ] that you wish you would have done and that coupled with this horror made it i mean this guy the way it unfolds holy [ __ ] so i am telling you two things it is without a doubt and i've sat with this movie for days already so i know it's true because usually i don't decide if i like a movie or not right away i have to. let it sit with me. this is one of without a doubt. one of the greatest movies. i've ever seen in my life. and i am also telling you don't watch. it and now you're gonna [ __ ] watch it because you know but don't and i'm not i don't say this to. be cute you know i've decided now i always i mean i won't even mention it. but it's just too good. um anyway dude this guy kristen taftra the movies. he makes unreal i can't watch. certain things now that i have. a [ __ ] kid you know it's tough saw the movie horrible woman that he also did and it's about some woman who like manipulates a dude. and keeps manipulating him. and it's crazy wild. man it's good dude. this guy's a great filmmaker. for those two movies i'm gonna watch his other one next it's called. parents that was the first. one he did um man. yeah it was a ride. bro uh let's look at this. jeremy fragrance thing because this guy is just uh i'm the number one. i'm the champion i'm the best. wow nobody has done what i have done in my field. i'm jeremy fragrance the number one. fragrance icon i did 1 000 pushups. in one hour on

my field i'm jeremy fragrance. the number one fragrance icon i did 1. 000 pushups in one. hour on the fifth avenue. i'm the number one. i'm the champion dude. 1 000 pushups in one. hour is that what he said that's so many right. oh yeah guy's pretty ripped. but uh he's still got like a kid. face you know dude. i don't like when guys with kid. faces get older like the actors that. were like popping when they were 22. and [ __ ] and then they get older and you're like oh that's what you look like now that's [ __ ] weird right um but this guy did it i mean in my field. which is his field. is sniffing his field. is sniffing good uh it's a good. uh perfume i did a lot i did i i did a 1000. pushup i mean the guy does coke. right for sure dude. let's watch this again i'm the number. one

one. i'm the champion wow. dude i'm the i'm the number one. i'm the champion on. the uh uh i did pushups. on the fifth avenue. dude hey man drop the that's so far. and that's what makes you the most foreign. the guy's just how about how uh takeoff was murdered man. so sad rest in peace. to take off dude. those rappers were like you know it's it's so weird. that these [ __ ] what's weird is rappers keep dying. and comedians keep dying and comedians maybe for their unhealthy. living make sense like if they're eating. too much or drinking. too much you know but like rappers keep dying. because they get shot which i guess. you know they live the game. too hard but this guy didn't even do that. the thing about takeoff which is he's from uh. um migos uh it's like he doesn't uh uh they were just like a party. rap you know they would rap about some of the same [ __ ] that these other guys were rap. about but like they were just like party. guys and i feel like they were good. guys i don't know maybe the one. of them isn't a good guy. but not this one. this one was like takeoff was like just some dude. that was like and he got shot. at a dice game and he wasn't even. doing the dice game dude. imagine you're at a dice game. not even doing the dice game. and that's the last [ __ ] experience you have 28. years old and his brother is in the group. his brother's name is cuevo.

everyone a lot of people pretended to. like after he died not that. they pretended to. like but they were like bout. it that they were about it. nipsy hustle really good but like everyone celebrated him. hardcore after he died. and it's like we get it. you knew him first you know. what i mean guy was a good. rapper but he was just kind of chilling. too not to. say you know i think a lot. of these guys because i think he was like a reformed gangster. i think was the thing with him. you think so yeah and i'm not sure. but uh just like [ __ ] man don't be uh rappers and comedians and firemen man.
