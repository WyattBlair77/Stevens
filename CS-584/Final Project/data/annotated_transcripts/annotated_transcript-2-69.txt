[ __ ] down um and we appreciate you and that's why it's a cult um but yeah dude uh the the lakewood show. is awesome the the [ __ ] um actually the lakeland. show was the one that uh i wanted to. you know uh look at so i have my buddy. put the camera thing on ah whatever. dude doesn't matter dude. i go to i was at the the air. airport when we landed in in lake. in uh wherever the [ __ ] we landed. we landed in tampa i think. i get there my crew's going. to the bathroom so i go. to starbucks so i go get a water. and this lady i was working at the starbucks. you know they have them. in the airport every few feet. and she was had she had like it. was like one of those standalone. ones like that wasn't in the wall. that was like outside of the wall. you know it was like not like it. was in the middle of a terminal. just like a standalone. starbucks like in in in the [ __ ] near the gate. and i was like i need a water. i want to. go get a water and the lady. behind the cash register who was doing something else right she was like she was doing something else like uh stop stalking something she's like oh i didn't even recognize you there and i say oh yeah all good and she says and it's you and i said yeah you know gotta be somewhere that's my thing when i say i finally figured out what to. say people say hey look chris leah and i say gotta be somewhere. because i do and you just happen. to be here as a matter. of fact it's weird as [ __ ] for you to. be here too dude. and we're both meeting two. souls and uh and she says i didn't even. recognize you there i said oh okay. all good goes back. to do her thing a little bit. i'll be right with you doing her. thing so say okay. um then she turns back around. and she says it's good. to see you man. it's good to. see you out here again. and i said okay well thanks. i appreciate that now i don't know. what she's talking about yes i have landed. in tampa before maybe she's a fan. maybe she knows i tour. and i haven't been to. tampa in a long time. or maybe she's just talking about because i took a little bit. of a hiatus and then came back i don't know what she's talking about okay nonetheless she's talking to. me and she's being very friendly. and that's awesome so i say that's great. thank you very much a few. maybe a minute goes by. just appear right there with you washing her. hands she says is that it. is that all you want. do you want your espresso over. ice and i say oh wow. this woman is a big fan. you know what your boy. gets i mean you know. what i mean if you had a crystalia. trivia what is his coffee. order would be one of the questions. and if you nail. down ice iced espresso i'll tell. you what you're a bigger fan. than somebody who would say iced. americano because that's what i used. to get but then he graduated to. some hardest [ __ ] so i go about this. lady not only is a fan. she's an uptodate fan so i say uh you know. what i'm not gonna get that. i just actually need a bottle of water. thank you very much it's pretty. it's pretty late and you know. i've been trying to. curb my coffee right. and she says great ringing. up the water and then she says to. me how were those cupcakes that you got commissioned from me. and i say oh oh this. was a waste this whole thing. she says how were those cupcakes you got commissioned so. now i'm in this spot. where i think well [ __ ] i either. gotta come clean or lie. also is she crazy or what's going. on here so she says how are those cupcakes that. got com that you got commissioned from me. and i was like oh and i felt so many different. emotions i was like this. lady has a starbucks job. and she's also making cupcakes for people. and who the [ __ ] did she think i am and also i know that you're not supposed. to judge a book. by his cover but do i look like a guy that gets cupcake. commissions like am i like a guy that's like oh you maybe i do maybe i look like a guy that's like you do. you do do that oh i gotta get some foreign. you do another job. even though i'm at this. job you do another job. and that's the thing you do well. let me hire those services like never would i ever. be a guy who walks in to. establish an establishment for a certain thing. and then purchase their side. job [ __ ] you know that's weird. to me so i she says did you get your your cupcakes commission. for me and i i just go. like this because here's the other thing. too in rehab they say. rigorous honesty dude you gotta be telling the truth. about everything or else you ain't. [ __ ] so i now in my head i gotta be like well if that's what they mean do they mean that for this or this is just like i don't even know this person so i'm like i gotta be like oh it's actually not i thought maybe you recognized me because i'm a community i gotta do all this [ __ ] i'm a comedian and i don't really know what you talk about the cupcake. here's the deal what if i say that and she's like no you got cupcakes commission and i'm just like oh i'm dealing with a [ __ ] lunatic with a job because lunatics have jobs. out there by the way you know we always think of lunatics. as just like walking around. on the street smelling bad talking. about the government but dude. there's luna there's high functioning. lunatics and this lady could be one of those so i i'm like she says very quickly. i do all these thoughts in my head. she says how are the kind of cakes. that you that you could that. you got commissioned from me. and i say well they were great. foreign and now i'm nervous because i'm like i hope. that this ends before. she realizes i'm the [ __ ] absolute you. know what i mean one. of the top dog comedians dude. i hope that she realizes this. before i'm some dude that [ __ ] sells out. copious theaters dude i hope she realizes before. she can place me in one. of my many tvs appearance i'm like. you know so i get the water. and i leave and then i tell lulu about it. and she and she's like laughing. so i didn't you know. i should have i should have maybe been honest. with her but i don't even know. for for all i know i don't i don't know. where that honestly because i don't know. where that i don't owe her. that because maybe she's just a crazy. person so it's all good. we figured it out. thank you we figured it out. on this podcast i appreciate you. guys i really do appreciate you. guys thank you um yeah. there's some [ __ ] crazy [ __ ] at coffee shops huh. like just straight up i go. there's a guy a coffee. shop i go to. and there's a guy with tourette. syndrome he's in there and one of it's pretty. alarming because i kind of like now i know but the first few times i went there. i'm like is this guy. just like what is he because a lot. of it would be like you know. he would do that i'm just like oh that's [ __ ] completely disgusting. don't get whatever you get usually. here you know it's making you do. that sir and then i realized he was saying. stuff like not even really necessarily bad words. that's the other thing too like it. would be really dope. to have uh tourette's but if it will. it would be horrible. to have tourette syndrome and honestly. i kind of feel like i a little bit understand. tourette syndrome because i think that's what ocd. is like a cousin. of tourette syndrome it. really is because like i don't have to. do that [ __ ] again but i have to. do this [ __ ] again so kind of that's what i would i kind of understand. when that when somebody's like ah but i gotta do. it monica lewinsky you know. what i mean or whatever. the [ __ ] i gotta do it you know i gotta do it and they're just like uh indians are the problems. whatever the [ __ ] right and so um so now i'm i i realize he has threat syndrome but do i go to. this coffee shop. man and he's always there. and and here's the thing. it's a little disconcerting in the beginning. but now i go there. and i love that. the guy's always there doing his [ __ ] thing and the people at the coffee. shop don't give a [ __ ] about it i love the acceptance. that they have for them. that dude i love it. right i just love it. the dude's sitting there he's about 60. something years old. and he's yelling out [ __ ] and he's not you know it's not horrible. stuff because that's the other thing. too if you have tourette syndrome. you want the stuff where you're not yelling. out you know right. like why can't you just be one. of the why don't it's always something. real bad it's never like big. fan of nascar or whatever. the [ __ ] how about a turkey sandwich. it's never that that would be [ __ ] ill as [ __ ] that's the tourette's i want. but um so he's doing that. and and and that coffee. shop so so just because that guy's doing that all the time. when i'm there the coffee. shop is obviously lit and i'm not gonna tell you what coffee. shop it is because i want to. go and i don't want people people. bugging me when i'm there. anyway they want pictures or whatever. what can i say he sells a copious. theaters but um yeah dude so the coffee shop is lit. they always ask me. if i wanted for that. if i have the app and it's like i don't want the app. i just let me [ __ ] do it you know and so today i go and there was a [ __ ] woman there a lady there on full on on a full on zoom. meeting on her computer check this. out dude no headphones [music]. no headphones dude just on it. first of all who goes on a zoom. meeting with no headphones even at home. dude don't you feel exposed put them. headphones on lady dude she's got no

and and and i got hit with the dude's breath again. i'm not lying i thought it. was a ptsd moment and there was a homeless guy out there like and i felt bad and i was like that is what that guy's breath smell. like so and then i went to. my car and noble. and for real there were there. was a couple in their back. seat just getting it on and i saw through. their front windshield and i was just. like this is the most lit. coffee shop that there has ever been in the world. god bless these people just doing. what the [ __ ] they want we all need to. strive to be a little. bit more like that now

before one. in my head bombs over a baghdad. you know what i mean. it's just like too much. also here's the thing he's the kind of guy. who asks a question and then lets. it sit a little bit. and then asks more about the question. dude fire them all off immediately farm all off let's get through. it we're on the sprinter van. watching [ __ ] dr pimple popper. which is a show where like by the way. what i watched dr pimple. popper i go like this but where are the pimples. dude they're like cutting out. baseballs a guy will show up with like a shark. fin on the back of his neck. and he'll be like yeah i've had it. for 30 years i just i don't know. it's like a guy why. weren't you taking i have 11. bumps on my head that the size of either a golf. ball or a softball and i've had them. on for 25 years and it's like hey but guy life. though didn't you ever wanna. do anything what about going. outside so we're watching the [ __ ] dr pimple. popper and we're on the it's in the sprinter van. and yes i have tv on. my sprinter van okay. and we're watching hulu. which is where dr. pimple popper is on the thing and i put on hulu and he goes like this hey man can you can we get the game oh no and i was like no and he says because why because you don't want to. and i was like no because you need a subscription. to get the game and this sprinter doesn't have a subscription to. hulu he says oh all right. there you go normal. person goes like this i wash my hands of that. conversation because it's over. so i turned on dr. pimple popper and under that it says what's on tv and he says hey man what sound are there and it says chiefs versus or whoever the [ __ ] they're playing and i said yeah that tells what else is on tv and he said i thought you said can't watch the football things and i was like you can't because we don't have a subscription well you remember i said that and he said okay man but i'm just saying they're down there oh cool thank you for telling me that so now we're watching dr pimple popper and he says and a commercial happens on dr pepper and he says hey man fast forward that and i said well do first of all do extra thinking right you got the guy's showing up at the door the party's going on inside and he's saying brought the casserole giving you the casserole and then just watching the party from the inside you brought the casserole come on in and have some but this guy is just at the door of this conversation and goes like this no that's it how come you don't really fast forward that so i say well you know how we can't watch the game because we don't have a subscription here we actually can't now this is the extra thinking part if you were to. just be a regular human for. a second you can't also you can't watch yeah. the pers obviously the subscription. is making so you don't have. to watch the commercials. give us cave fast. forward two commercials right. and he says all right. oh okay and i just i feel them. dude we're watching the commercials. and i'm just feeling them. and like two commercials later. he says you fast forwarded. it earlier and i'm just like oh dude. but it was during the show. part wasn't it and he says so just fast. forward this part and i and i'm like are we really doing. this dude because this is a step. closer to. fisticuffs like you're you're not doing extra. you're not doing it you're just come. on in dude come on into. the party have some of this. dip drink some of this. punch eat some of the casserole. you brought dance but he's just i don't. do that so i'm like you can't. fast forward the commercials. remember that and he says well you just fast. forwarded already and i said yeah the part of the show. and he says all right. and then he says because it was the episode. that we had watched in the uh hotel. room and he wanted to. show somebody part of it and he said well you should fast. forward to the part. oh he said he says i said so i no i'm sorry. so i fast forwarded. to the part that we want to. see at the end with the guy. getting the thing cut out of his neck. and he says man. and i'm like yeah and he says you just fast. forwarded it and i said i fast. forward the show part and he said well then why but you fast. forward past all the commercials. and i said no i didn't do. it watch watch what happens now. the commercials come on and i say you got to. watch the commercials if you fast. forward this [ __ ] because those are the ads you can't fast forward the commercials. and i wanted that's what i imagined. you know what i mean. and he says so now we got to. watch all the commercials. on the tv that we skipped and i said dude. we finally got to. the part where i don't. know but it doesn't matter. so i'm like and i'm like i gotta sit with this. [ __ ] just like why all the who am i chris hulu. i don't know just [ __ ] can we i'm all steaming. i just want to. watch the guys back of the naked. [ __ ] i want to. see his bumps removed and so that's what he's like right. so we're watching dr pimple. popper we show everyone everybody's. flipping out because the guy's getting his neck. sawed off or whatever. so we get to. jacksonville we go to. sleep whatever the [ __ ] and then it's like the next day. he wakes up and it's and and i have a text. from him in the text. group and it said no. [ __ ] it says this i reserved the court. at 12 30. i'm going to. get paddles now meet at the court. y'all it's 11 something and he says meet at 12th and i and now i'm offended. because you don't know. me first of all huh. second of all don't put money. down on anything expecting me i'm gonna be there. okay second of all 12. 30. i wake up at 12. paddles. you want me moving around. within 30 minutes dude i can't. even talk to you. until three so i'm looking at the rest of the text. and denny and lulu are like oh man. already oh what and i go. and i say hey we gotta not not do. this i gotta get coffee. i'm getting coffee denny and lulu like yeah. you get coffee and then i'm like what. is this and i realize it's a paddle ball. or no pickleball ah [ __ ] you know there's so many of them there's so many different sizes of paddles. and balls and heaviness of balls. and the courts are different sizes. and then there's even a table one. like a ping pong. it's like figure out the good. one and then that's it. it's in between somewhere tennis and ping pong. which it might be pickleball. it may be compatible i don't know i used. to play oh i played all of them. but it's like if we figured it out. great but we should have already figured it out. so now this pickleball is all the rage and people are like oh they love how emma whoever did the twilight [ __ ] is into. it or not not her. no the one who did the one. who played the in the uh uh the wizard. movie uh harry potter. who's that one emma watson she's like uh you look at a pickleball. hashtag and it's like every picture is of emma. watson doing the thing and so i'm like you want. to play pickleball and i just go i've got to. get a coffee dude. this is just this is literally and you want me. to for how by the way. here's the thing you don't play. sports where you need to. get equipment for for less. than an hour it's like you got to. play for at least an hour. but most of the time. way more than that. so i'm like i also have to. do a show tonight i'm doing. 70 minutes for 2. 800 people your boy's got to. be ready okay and here's the other thing. i don't wake up and not take a shower. i wake up and i take a shower. so this means i gotta take two showers. so anyway this is all the stuff. that's going on in my mind. and i said we got to. get a coffee so we do we went and we did. a [ __ ] one sip coffee review it's over on the crystally official. channel we went to. side side somewhere some coffee. it was it was good um so go check that. out but um i might not be up. yet but so we get to. coffee and david no. we go in the lobby. to meet get the coffee. without david because we don't know. where the [ __ ] he is he's m.i.a doing something pickleball. mission it's like noon. something it's like maybe 12. 30 when the courts were already reserved and david comes walking in because we're waiting for everyone to. go to get the coffee. wait for the uber david comes. walking in with a sack. dude with like not a a bag. it's like a sack with handles coming. out of it four of them. so now i'm like oh were you at the courts. and he's like yeah man. for like 20 minutes. and i said oh oh so it was like one. right already is it. really and he said yep. i said well uh what were you. doing there he said i don't know. man everyone already had players with each other. so i was just kind of playing by. myself and i said i i was like you just went to. the pickleball courts hoping for the best with four paddles. like what the [ __ ] what is this. white men can't jump. like this is not you didn't. go to the [ __ ] it's not basketball. dude so he comes back. and i'm like you were just there. yeah i was just hitting back. and forth i don't know. just kind of smashing it i'm like oh dude. you're a loser man. you're 45 doing this. and so i'm like well we gotta go. get a coffee so we go. get a coffee and he's got the [ __ ] sack of pickleball. uh paddles we get to. the coffee place we're drinking the coffee. sitting down and we're eating the [ __ ] sandwiches and david's just like this. this is what david's doing he's looking. at his phone he's going like this. well i'll be damned and i was like what and he said the pickleball. court is literally across the street. and i and i in my head. i'm like who hoodwinked me. who was it because sam my camera. guy was saying that this was the coffee. shop that we could go to. did david have it like a sidebar. discussion with him and said we should go. to this place so now i'd be close. to because the only way i'm going. to do the pickleball shits. is if i am right. there because i'm i'm in i'm in my [ __ ] yeezys i'm in like i don't wanna i'm not ready. my manager's in jeans. and [ __ ] keds or whatever the hell he wears on his feet i think they're vans or keds and like so we go over there and he got me dude i played i played pickleball for the they've been trying to. get me to play.
