[ __ ] become i'm going to. drive for ups dude. did you know how many times i i'm like i don't. know if that joke's good enough. i don't know if i should do that. should i put that out and you got people. out there hey where you from oh yeah oh you're a teacher oh yeah whoa he's all like i'm a teacher. and they like oh i just dude. this whole wave of stand. i i don't even know. if i'll do honestly let me be honest. with you i put out my special. i made a [ __ ] lot of money. on my special doing it. my way that's great and it's great. that i made money on it. i have money dude i may. not even do another special. i because it's so quick. and the turnaround is so it's like i see. other comedians put stuff. out and it's like oh they're talking about the thing that just happened a month ago. it's like by a year from now. i do this bit and i've been working. on it for a here like like i did. this joke about the um the spiderman. meme where i was like my my it's in grow. or die i was talk. about how my these people are i i say these three people are. looking at each other it's like. that spiderman meme dude. i've been doing that since like that. meme came out and now i heard it's out. on my grower die. and i've been doing it. for two years but like there's people who are doing that. joke now and it's like i don't think they stole it. or i don't you know. i don't know if they saw me. do it and then [ __ ] did it themselves. but it's like like it's kind of not the hardest. thing to think of you. know obviously they probably aren't doing. it the same way i'm doing. it but it's like oh you gotta [ __ ] let this [ __ ] be out it's like you're trying to. beat everyone to the punch. and that's what that's what i. don't like about uh i don't know man. i i feel like these jokes. need you need time to. like do it but i guess. that's not the [ __ ] thing anymore. i'm the old guy. talking now because it's like that's why. i used to. get annoyed with twitter. when i would tweet it's like people. are just like they wait. for somebody to die. just to make a joke. about it on twitter. and it's like all right. dude you got your [ __ ] nine followers from it it was sad. that the person died though. how about and how about just chill. and this is a first draft. joke it just happened but then people became millionaires off the [ __ ] so it's like okay you got people sitting in seats because of this i don't know man but anyway it's easy to. become a [ __ ] model models really took it into. their own uh hands though didn't they we realized how everyone like how how we realized how the real people. like curvy women and [ __ ] you know. like remember when mods used. to be all like remember. when jen aniston was like it dude. if instagram was around back. then jen aniston would have been treated like taylor. swift by people who are like oh. dude she has no butt. she's [ __ ] this and that she's mid all the friends cast would be latino you know. it'd be like [ __ ] it wouldn't be jennifer it would be like um yenifer what's the [ __ ] monica it. would be monique you know. chandler would be teso. hey what's up i'm back. joey comes in whoa [laughter]. dog jose it would be [ __ ] and and and everyone. would be thick as [ __ ] although what's her name. was hot um monica courtney. cox yeah she was and you know. i'm not taking anything away. from jenna aniston and and and and and lisa kud was was good. looking it's just yeah we really. got exposed by liking. them thick thick you know cuz instagram is like you just got oh i dud. i always think about this disneyland. and how expensive. it is this is crazy. dude what i here's what i don't. get about pr like nick. cannon say this is the headline. nick tannan says he probably spends $200,000 a year. taking his 12 kids to. disneyland first of all it's too. many kids okay but second of all. if you have 12 kids. you go to disneyland. we know cuz disneyland it. costs $25 for a cocacola. um so but what i here's what i don't. get because this is in people magazine. i know nick canon is a star. and has been a star. for a long time um but honestly. why is this in the [ __ ] any news. that's what i don't get like i don't understand. why so he look. he appeared at the breakfast. club show friday this is how it happened told the host that he goes to. disneyland at least once a month. to celebrate special occasion. kids lives between birthday. holiday you know how much money. i spent in disney that. year um a lot he confirmed. by saying to move around. disney like i'm probably spending $200,000 a year. at disneyland okay so first of all he said probably. which means it's a he doesn't know. second of all this is in people. magazine do people i mean i'm clicking on this. because it's ridiculous are people like is a pr. person being like hey we got to. get this in the the news. cuz like crazy [ __ ] happens to. stars that nobody reports on and and why. is this in it. you know what i'm saying he has 12. kids dude that's fantastic. i love that i love uh i love nick. cannon i love that. he has 12 kids dude. that's so awesome i i would do that. if i had neverending money um i would have so many kids and all my haters. would be like oh no i'd be like do we don't i'd be. like babas kids we don't die. we multiply i don't understand. the people like nikki hil. like here's another one. nikki hilton admits motherhood definitely changed her bond with sister paris hilton dude first of all like i guess that's pr right because who the [ __ ] and i don't mean this is a disrespect like they're great i those women i don't know that at all they they they do good [ __ ] maybe i don't know i don't [ __ ] know i don't know i'm talking to. my ass no knock on them. but who the [ __ ]

he's expelled from congress. everybody does all of the bad. things when you're at that. level so su they [ __ ] pick and choose willynilly [ __ ] it's unbelievable like trump had the documents at his house every other president. always took documents and [ __ ] that's just if you're the president. and you're not taking doc documents. home you're not really being the president. dude i want a president. that takes the work home. with him documents and all i want secret. dossier i want all. sorts of [ __ ] i want the i want i want i want my president. to take documents home. dude because i want him to. do i want him to. have homework because he's the president. i want him to. have the documents on him. when he's playing golf. every president plays [ __ ] golf. i want to. except for joe biden. cuz he would fall the [ __ ] down but but uh did you see about the thing when he was saying. to uh joe biden when joe biden was with the the little girl. and he was like how old are you and and she and she was like how old do you think he was like 17 she was like and the mom. was like she's six you saw that. k not the president anymore. dude you make a mistake. like that not the president. anymore a sixyearold looks like only. a sixyearold um. but yeah i don't it's so weird. how like this [ __ ] happens. with political figures because hey they all do. it they all do it. it's hard even to. believe in a democracy. and i don't mean to. [ __ ] turn into. right chris but it's hard. even to believe in a democracy. when you know there's [ __ ] behind the scenes. we don't know stuff that. the government's doing and i'm not even. saying that we should i don't even. give a [ __ ] we're never going to. know all this [ __ ] so the whole do your own. research [ __ ] i'm just like i have no idea what what is it. you can do confirmation. bias if i really wanted to. look into joe biden being a lizard. i could probably find some [ __ ] where i'd be like oh man. maybe he does go into. the ocean and shed his skin. it's out there ah let's do some of this. here um elo gret. and dugan truest baby sending. you elder pin now tai g plays golf. like the cops are after. him to liz. from will in portland. happy 10th wedding anniversary. uh go to my uh holler. do what is it get get your a shout out. or ads whatever at holler. bab christalia and there you go. um is billy ish gay. um billy alish came out as gay. god you know what i i i i it's i i the fact. that it's new news to. come out and be like sexuality. should straight up just be nobody's business. period or or everyone's business. if we didn't give a [ __ ] but people do give a [ __ ] obviously so um also we know she's gay you know she's too successful. and poppy to not be gay. at this point everyone's got to. be gay you you can not. be gay if you're a pop. singer what' she say though. like no we love her. out of that reception. field did your has your mind. changed a little bit i'm still. scared of them but i think they're pretty he's double what the [ __ ] is this why did it and then espresso ad pop up in the middle of it george clone in his [ __ ] espresso ads it's like come off it dude guy's got8 trillion do um so billy alis confirmed that she recently came out we know you know you you can't not be like they're all gay wait she revealed she didn't intend to. make a grand gester of coming. out no i didn't iish said but i kind of thought wasn't it. obvious i didn't realize people didn't know i just don't really believe in it. i'm just like why can't we just exist. agree i've been doing this. for a long time and i just didn't talk. about it whoops. agree dude billy alice you got a new fan.
