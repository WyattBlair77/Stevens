we start. that's the american version of that. i mean we started is. still the right way okay. you can wait so we agree. way too close. on that yeah it's all. good that's that's that's very confrontational. that's what you did. this is lifeline episode two dude. we finally made it to. episode two i don't know. if we're gonna um and also [ __ ] smash hit dude. yeah it's big yeah we're a smash. hit so that's it. and we're counting on you. to keep doubling it. with the views doubling it. and doubling it until they kill. me did you know. that so irish doubling it. uh i did know that. two bucks at that you know. why i knew two. bucks said yeah because you say it. all the [ __ ] times double it we're going to. double it and we're going to. keep doubling it until they kill. me although he said that. n word but i can't so it's fine. yeah you definitely can't. but he said it nor. should you desire it. but you can't do it no. i don't you mean just because he's nobody wants. right right right in this. room anyway um so yeah so too much. traffic driving down here right. just before we start for you. i know but not for you. but here's the thing about living. in la and it's going. to piss you off and frankly. i don't care wow you. so many disclaimers you already live. you live in l.a oops. i know i bro that's why. i did it out of the microphone. i was crinkling it it's fine. you already live in la you've lived in l.a for so long. you you can only complain. about la traffic within like the first few. years of living in la because otherwise it's your own. fault because you didn't take traffic. into account now i'm pissed. yeah i knew and it's fine. but here's the deal though it's i don't normally. ever drive downtown well you've driven downtown a few. times for this i know but this is and i used. to live downtown and you used. to come downtown when i lived here. i know that but this traffic. was worse yay dude. he figured it out. and we both agree on it. and that's fine dude. we agree it was. different you pissed off. the dog the dog bark but it's fine. dude because it was too. much what you were doing. i know but i didn't even hear. it because i was in my head. going yay and it's oh no. because you were being too [ __ ] loud is why. you did that dog. was cheering with me because you know. the traffic is absolutely not. and it was specifically worse. today great no it wasn't dude. la traffic is always bad stop clapping it's not well. okay it's usually bad this. was horrendous [ __ ] yeah dude stop doing that but it wasn't it deserves a round of applause. you know what i do. deserve that hoodie no it's mine. i know it's mine you. can't have it i deserve. it i really like it. it's yellow and it pops and you're trying. to basically s you're trying. to subtly take the visual. visual away i did do. that yeah but but you're trying. to subtly take it away. from me by using a bright. color by not saying look at me did you get paint. on it or it came. like that no this came like that. dude you know that. i didn't know that you think i was outside. just well actually if i thought more about it. you never picked a [ __ ] paint brush in your life dude. that's not true okay what's the last. thing you painted a picture. of a selfportrait in eighth. grade yeah okay well then you don't paint. okay well you thought it. was outside what is this. outside with the paint who paints like that. jackson pollock in me. no he didn't do that. he stood over the canvas and did like this. he didn't like whip it. who's that guy who does the who's the the [ __ ] guy who sells like the worst. [ __ ] now he's like a pop artist. he did the um oh uh drake's. album darien or something oh i don't know damian hurst sounds. like a singersongwriter that would just damage. i don't i don't know what that. is yeah so he does. stuff like like this and then sells it. literally for millions of dollars. yeah yeah that's nothing but i didn't do. that to this anyway. right damian did damon came. over and did that damn her. shirt no no no no that if i if it did dude. i'd be set for life. this [ __ ] i could sell for millions. of dollars he's that big he's huge do. it damn yeah okay and people think he's a con artist. you should be a con artist. and say damian hirsch did that. to that shirt and sell it. for three million dollars on ebay. no what did you think about. no i didn't think about it. you should about i'd even know. it had [ __ ] paint splotches on it till i said it yeah do you look at what you wear before you put it on no i go. by feeling i go by. feeling i feel the i feel the article of clothing. that's why it's so stylish. well that's why you always look. the way you do and that. explains a lot and i feel like that. i feel like with that hoodie. you know what i feel about. it i feel like it's mine. so bullets i deserve it. that's not your feelings i deserve. it yes the traffic's too. long and he deserves the hood. that is the most annoying thing. you could ever ever [ __ ] do that. is the most annoying thing. you could ever do imagine a lawyer. doing it and yeah i had so much. evidence yeah so i'm sure. the jury will acquit him. yeah i would never win. a single [ __ ] case. i don't know man in times. like these no that's nothing okay. that is nothing well last episode. you got mad at me. for saying uh the heart wants. what the heart wants that. is so what you just said. is even more enough what did. i say that was nothing. i forgot what did he say. about how times like in times. like these it means nothing. you don't need to. preface that ever in times like. these you only need to. preface it if you're talking about. other times yeah yeah but no about the time. you're in you never need to. say in times like these because everything. anybody says in a time. that you're in it's implied that. it's true in times like these you don't need to. preface it when it's already. in times like these by saying in times like these okay i understand. what you're saying because it's true. but that's not true because times because that's it's like saying. are you kidding me. now no well i can just add now. and make a point but i did are you kidding. me it's not like you're kidding. me dude if a lawyer came out and was like [ __ ] doing all sorts of really great presenting. right and [ __ ] crossexamination up the [ __ ] you know just leaving people up shit's creep without a paddle and just [ __ ] slam it and he goes like this yeah i had so much evidence yay yeah i proved it yeah i'm sure the jury will acquit him yay you don't think that he that would be not only would he get away with it that would be a good thing that's fine but you're wrong and and that's crazy i would not help so any lawyer and any client would fire would be right to. and would just fire. that lawyer if i was on the [ __ ] thing i would stand up right with him on the jury wherever i was [ __ ] mistrial. if you clapped along with the lawyer. mistrial okay then you'd have to. start over again which isn't necessarily a bad thing. but that's true um so i actually wondered that. why people don't because the mistrial. is good for the defendant. you know yeah why don't they just take their like pants. yeah start shooting on the floor. and the lawyer with a suit. on with his pants. all crinkled up just like whoops. yeah mister yeah walk forward. i'm doing a mistrial. i uh i just found a loophole. in the legal system there you. go so during time like z's that's crazy. nope um so we had a great. episode the first episode it. was really fun uh we gave a bunch. of amazing advises we really. did yeah i did. you're right um and uh you know we can basically just it's not. we're not therapists no we're not therapists. we're definitely not there but it's entertainment. and entertainment and this is comedy. comedy podcast and we're rip roaring. should we go we want to. want to start it. off now let's start it. off dude the way he said it. yeah like a [ __ ] as well yeah yeah gonna crash and burn all right. it has nothing has nothing for us. here we go hey guys um let's get straight. to it um i was to. have i had to. have a debate. with a friend of mine. and uh we're trying to. settle whether or not um we should entertain. small talk and i told him. about this person that i met. at an elevator i go to. an international school so it's normal. for people to ask where you're from. and i got to. ask that but i was going. down one floor so i just said you know. we don't have to. do this because i didn't want to. start explaining and then the door opens. and you have to. do that awkward goodbye and you know. so but i can't think of a way. of saying that without it. being rude because my friend thinks it's rude. so uh do you guys think it's rude. to just say it as it. is and is there a way to. say that without sounding rude. i can think of it. anyway i love you guys well that guy. doesn't seem like a rude. guy he's not rude so if he can say it and get away. with it then it's fine. he's talking about how being in the elevator and somebody's saying well. first of all how many put it this. way if the building. is sky high right. and you get into. a an elevator and someone's there. and they say hey how's it. going you're both going up. you might be on a 100th floor. empire state building okay but if the building. is like eight or floors. less and you actually say hey how's it going. and you decide to. start small talk with somebody. in an eightstory [ __ ] building. yeah you're a piece of [ __ ] right we can agree on that well i think there's cause it's if it's how's it going. that's fine but he's didn't he say. somebody asked him where he's from. oh that yeah but that's terrible. though that's no good because then you got to. get in places where you're from. yeah no nobody wants you. you're gonna wind up in the other guy's apartment. if it's like a [ __ ] i think that's rude. of that person to. do that almost it is uh but i look i think the answer. to your question is as long as you're not. being rude it's not rude. okay what does that mean. though you're it means as long as you're not like look. there's a way to. do it you know he just did. like that that's rude. of [ __ ] fine you and the horse. you wrote in on but no i'm actually i'm saying the thing. that he said we don't have. to do that oh right. he said we don't have to. do that right right which could i guess. be real it could be it's a pretty. rude thing to say yeah. if that's like if you're trying to. shut it down right what's the nonrude. way thing to. say i don't uh speak english. only words i know are these words. i'm saying right now no no. no no no extra words but all of these words. i'm saying and also golf. and shoes but that's it. and that's it but you also if you don't want to. lie what's the right. way to to. shut it down if i'm in an elevator and i and it's eight. stories up well whatever yeah okay. no it's different if it's a hundred stories maybe maybe it's not rude. to say hey where are you. from you're both stuck in a [ __ ] box. for a hundred floors i don't like where you're from in general. though well yeah that's annoying. well no but they asked him. because he walked in and he was from like with the south. africanamerican because he had an accent you know they must get which is another thing clear your accent up don't be like that where's he live no no no if he lives in america do an american accent which is you know there's no reason to. ask a stranger where they're from just because they have an accent. that is [ __ ] annoying interesting rule i like that rule wow where are you from but what if you're really interested still wow. uh no i don't i don't i don't know. i mean if you have like a if you have a fur. if you think you know where it's from. right south africa south. africa no not that. if you ask and you have like more to. say about where you think the accent's. from maybe that's okay. but we're getting away from it. the it's not rude i don't think to. be like we don't need to. do that but i'll tell you what a lot. of people are going to. think you are [ __ ] rude. and there's no way. around that that's true. but also people are going to. think of rude no matter. what you do exactly because like if he's looked. at me and said if i say oh yo where you. from he said we don't have to. do this and they did the thing. i would laugh yeah right. but i don't think it's true. most people would think that's rude. for sure i don't and you don't but a lot. of people would be like that's [ __ ] rude. yeah we don't need to. do that that's like people would think that's condescending. yeah and they're like but what about. pleasantries they go like that. but you they gotta work. on their own [ __ ] just be you like the [ __ ] last one be unapologetically. you you could do a spin move if you want. when you leave the elevator okay you can't have spin move be ev. every piece of advice that you give be do. a spin move i think that okay. i i know that but i think spin moves. like you're barry sanders that's awesome. okay so you're not rude. don't worry about other people. and honestly if people think you're being rude. for just speaking your truth. and not being aggressive about it. yeah then that person is a hater. and if you have haters you're winning. so there you go. good job okay okay stop i know dude. definitely stop clapping all right so we all. agree on the traffic thing. in this here we go. wanna go to another. one let's do another one. i'm glad we could help. these people hey crystal matt. my name is caroline. um i first lost one. to say true baby. and life always rips um i think i have a good. one for you so i recently went through. a breakup the person. that i broke up with set. very clear boundaries for like how they wanted the breakup. to go they were like don't like post. a lot on social media. about how much fun you're having now. that you're single um don't like hang out. with these people too much. if it means that i can't that kind of stuff. but then they're not respecting. those boundaries that they set for me. they're posting things all the time. they're hanging out with people all. the time how do i approach that. in a way that's still respectful. to what they want while. not compromising what i want. i got thanks for the submission. i got a really good piece of advice. for you that person does. not deserve her respect because he. is asking her not to. do something and then he goes and does it. you that's like you have [ __ ] car blanche. to not do any of the [ __ ] he asked. for he's saying hey don't he has all these [ __ ] rules. for her yeah he's being a bit of a nazi. about it and he doesn't have to. [ __ ] follow them then why does she have to. follow them because of being a nazi. about it but don't nazis don't. believe in me that's a bit. much i'm just saying he's not being a [ __ ] nazi. i'm just saying he's being a piece. of [ __ ] and i don't think you need to. respect him at all piece. of [ __ ] is not a bit much but nazi. is i think not correct. piece of [ __ ] is way less bad. than nasty because nazi is. the worst possible thing. this is what you will. be doing on the break. up ground rules you will. not be posting with friends. that we both have too much. you will not be having a good. time too much on social. media right but it wouldn't surprise. me if he wasn't he was okay now. so whenever you don't need to. be driven to. be a nazi though. i know that but most hardcore nazis. aren't for sure most true. oh geniuses so we break up. so good we break up. good no posting on social media. if you will be sucking dicks you will. not be letting me know. about it okay. if you will be sucking songs. you will not be knowing about i will. not be knowing about this if you will be taking this in the back. you will not be telling me. about this please right. right okay but what about the advice. though if you will be dating what what do you think what should she do. yeah well i want to. know do i want to. go deeper into. this i want to. know did he set up the rules. for the both of them or just her. either way it's nazi. like activity because here's the deal. if he's like these are so rules. we are going to. go by and then he goes back. on on his it was all propaganda so he could just get what he wants. but it's very naziish propaganda but if if he says you will not be doing this. and i will be doing this. that's also very naziish right. right because it's very controlling. right i think that this. guy honestly in a few years. you're gonna realize that this guy. was a joke i don't. know much about this guy i don't know his side. of his story at all but i have the feeling. if he told me his side. of the story it would be in a german. accent so honestly i think that you should probably just either do what you want and why can't you just block. him or hide him. block each other she's being too nice. she's being too she should not he's already. basically given you license to. do whatever the [ __ ] you want because he gave you rules. that he doesn't whether he plans. on following them himself or. planned on following them himself. said he was going. to follow them too or made them. just for her that's even [ __ ] worse. either way [ __ ] this guy do whatever you want post whatever you want do whatever you want [ __ ] see whoever you want date whoever you want hang out with your friends whenever you want [ __ ] that guy pretty harsh and i think that we should just kind of make it a little bit of a softer thing and say he's probably a nazi and you know what that's not softer uh he's a nazi and um also ch. you know just be careful. be wary right because these guys. are in trouble and i'm just saying you don't. want yourself you're adding your knots. right you're adding the nazi. parts you don't want your skin. to end up being a lampshade. right now that would have been great. if it was not interrupted but now it. seems a little bit dark. and shitty when i was doing it. it was going to. be great and have a great. payoff oops it did. seem dark and shitty i will grab right. right that's because we stopped so it's my fault. yes a thing you said was dark. and shitty and it's [ __ ] my dude and it was going to. be damn home run but it was and then you came and then petered out. no i don't like anything that you're saying. okay but i do like her and i i'm on her. [ __ ] side and i [ __ ] do not like that guy okay and i think you should maybe even specifically do what he said not to. be wow dude he's being such a piece. of [ __ ] you're she's being such a piece of he's being such a piece of [ __ ] to. her you don't know his side. of the story dude she seems very sweet. she seems very sweet. this guy could come on our show. next week and be like listen. you know it's very upsetting. because what has happened. was she was basically um making uh uh she was basically making the the the relationship. seemed like it wasn't i was a very nice guy. i would always buy her. things okay but we're not hearing. his side right. we're only hearing her side. it's okay gives a [ __ ] about his side. my whole problem with it is. she was obviously flexing her. watch and in the [ __ ] thing like this. yeah no i liked that watch. yeah no she's she's pr. i'm i'm playing and he's probably you know. do what you want yeah. if you're broken up do what you want. do what you want anyway. that's a good point. yeah he shouldn't have made [ __ ] rules. [ __ ] him the whole i don't know turtles all the way down [ __ ] him all the way down he's [ __ ] [ __ ] wow i don't like this guy wow okay and i'm glad you broke up with him okay cool wasn't worth it okay bad guy guys gonna grow up to. be a [ __ ] dictator you know it. yeah he's a bad guy. okay yeah all right. next yo oh it's the dude. from the last time. the guy okay play it i was going. through his hair's different. his is different he's trying. to disguise himself well let me. tell you something right. now we don't we have not seen. these videos beforehand we've decided not. to see the videos. beforehand because we think it. gives more authentic visceral reactions. and uh we we go with our. gut immediately yeah and that's yeah. good well we have the option. people producers do you want to. see him yeah no we don't say. no so okay so let's play this guy this. is a followup i suppose. unless he's a twin play. over again yo on the french. girl situation wow told her. i was going to. france she was like oh wow. that's so cool that's awesome. i told her about the drawings. too and she goes. yeah it's nice honestly. but a little weird because i have a boyfriend. and we're probably never going. to see each other again. oh anyways cried about it. had a good night's sleep. it was so definitive and matter. of fact that i can't be in denial. and it feels healthy. i'm still going to. france because i'm enrolled in school. there but it's six hours. away from her cities so no stalking um thanks for keeping absolutely. [ __ ] real and giving me the benefit of the doubt. and being hilarious peace. broke down in [ __ ] tears for 35. minutes after the video. even right after the video. dude i wonder what happened. after the [ __ ] call yeah my favorite [ __ ] part was got a good night's sleep [laughter]. yeah you know cried. my [ __ ] ass off got a good night's sleep. got up you know dude. unreal dude [laughter] good night. sleep eat a great breakfast. like dude you know gotta work. out in played some ball. with the homies yeah dude. so he didn't let me let's just go. first of all let me do this. for good measure knew this. was going crazy here's the thing. man and i wanted to. talk about this because this has been sitting with me since last episode. last episode this guy said he's been trying. to move for a girl. that he talks to. every few months now matt's a couple months. a couple months yeah right. a couple months i did. say he misspoke you said he missed. poke and you kind of [ __ ] you didn't bully. me into it but made me feel bad. you're like be nice be nice that's on you. though all right dude but you said make make sure you know he might have misspoke. so i said okay. yeah maybe he did misspoke. and i'm driving home after the [ __ ] podcast and i'm like i don't think he did. misspeak and i feel bad that i said. that and i was right. dude yes i was right. man but you didn't misspeak and he was just if we rolled. the tape right now the truth. is you said i think he misspoke. you said that you said it. first i did say it. first but you said it. i know because you kind of i don't want to. see you bullying me you're saying it's my fault. it is your fault. no it's [ __ ] not dude. here's the deal to. assume he misspoke is absolutely correct. because he crazed yeah okay. sure so you don't assume someone it's [ __ ] a crazy but why don't you know somebody's crazy when you [ __ ] see them normally. his hair was nice he like looked like he looks like a good. guy i wish him all the best. and i think that's obviously good. and he's going to. find a romantic partner. he obviously isn't crazy. dude you know what i mean. i'm saying he crazed but i'm not saying right. right really actually crazy. that's why i say he crazy. because we actually thought he was crazy. we wouldn't even have him. on the podcast we would feel bad. you crazy is different than crazy. right right and he also has um he also asked us. to roast him right. he did the first video. yeah he said roast us so roast me throws to. us you know he's crazy. schizophrenia more than one yeah do it. and um so he uh uh so robin williams what i just did. so um so anyway um that's good he seemed like he figured it out. and i like you know what i like about this. guy what don't point at me. boy if he is crazy. or not if he's crazy. you're crossing you're crossing my you're encroaching. yeah we're gonna have a [ __ ] problem you know what the you know what i like about this guy what do you like his craziness comes into. play and then it's okay. that's not what it is. on to the next. on to the next. crazy right my concern. is he's not going to. learn the lesson he's going. to be crazy again. he is oh he is okay. on to the next. on on to the next. drawing pictures on to. the next on on to. the next on to. the next he's just going. to alter the drawings. for the next person he's like [ __ ] i already got i already got 71. of them i don't want to. start over yeah dude what just facetiming with her. crying what do i do. with all these drawings yeah. [ __ ] drawings of like [ __ ] of her naked just tits spilling out looking like salvador dali whoops went too far. anyway but what i think in general. yeah i'm concerned he's not going. to learn a lesson. moving forward and uh i'm i'm i'm wondering. why he let himself. think it was a good. idea to move there. oh boy crazy yeah i mean. there's no yeah no accounting for a craze. people try to. [ __ ] act like there's a thing you can do to. help crazy but there's not unless you're a medical doctor right. but he's probably not actually crazy. but yeah dude look man. this is how it is and this is good. that it's happening to. him at a younger age. because it you know. it helps him you know. get ready for life do you think he is 23. 22. yeah i'm bad at that i don't. know how old anybody is ever yeah. i just found out that harrison ford. is 32. no i think you're misinformed nope. i think so he's 32. well when did star wars. come out when he was no. see no see this says this. math doesn't work because even if he was one. no no whatever agree to. disagree but uh so yeah. so we appreciate you checking back in and that's a cool. thing we can do on. this podcast i like that yeah i didn't know we were uh that. was going to be a thing. yeah but i guess it is so yeah. the advice now is to. just keep on moving and uh try to. be a little bit less. craze in every relationship even if it's not a relationship and you think it is check in with someone else to. make sure that it's because he was making us. think that he they didn't. even do the horizon and technically. he checked in with us did. they even hook up marco. they didn't even hook up. how does he and he was gonna move. the [ __ ] were your buddies. now i don't know no. he he said he never did. he said he never hooked up. with the girl oh on the video yeah. no oh okay oh okay. wow so there we go he never he. never hooked up with the girl. we could do a whole. episode on this guy so he sent the video. oh okay truth comes. out he sent a video he also wrote in it. he said it's in one. of those things i don't know. if he said it oh he wrote okay i also wrote in and he said it's clear. it's probably clear to. you now that we didn't hook. up okay so they didn't even. hook up and he was gonna move. countries for her all good. okay yeah that's bad. okay so anyway feel for you though. bro it's hard out there. love life that's tough that's tough but unrequited love. is tough unrequited love. never know what that is i hear. it all the time. never knew it you don't. know what it is nope. well now you do right. you've gleaned what it is. it's when somebody loves somebody but the other person. doesn't love them back correct. knew it but you know. the point is you didn't know it. didn't have to. look it up but knew it. felt it okay you know. what i mean like you're with me. you're [ __ ] 40. i'm 42 40 you're 42 bad brother. wow such a bad brother. i know how old you are. dude i know how you are you. don't you're same as harrison. ford all right okay you wanna. do next one what is this. okay oh this is a written. one oh this is going. to be sick i want. to read it out loud. i have a great speaking. voice but you can want me. to read it i'll read. it hello gentlemen an evil. villain i grew up. in a super religious family. and as i've gotten older. i've realized that organized religion is not. for me great i've felt a lot. freer since i've broken away. from religion but my family. is still very religious. and involved with the church. and i'm finding it more. and more difficult to. dance around the subject. at family gatherings i figured i could. get some sage advice from my cult leader and pastor m diesel about how i should approach this sensitive issue do i continue to. play along for the sake of peace. or do i speak my true. beliefs so that i can. be more real with my family. love you guys and thanks for years. of entertainment that's so we totally get by. the way why you didn't do. a video because then your family. would see it and you would be and the whole advice. is what should you let them. know or not know so again. yeah that's that's that is hard. i mean that's a real hard. thing to do i feel very strongly. about just religion and belief. in general but you believe in jesus. christ our lord and savior yeah exactly um i i i wish i i wish i knew a little bit better. about like what how hardcore they. might be yeah sort of like straying we'll assume they're really hardcore. i mean he's obviously struggling with it. there will obviously be a huge rift. if he says something yeah okay is it. worth that or is it. worth sucking it up. and just being like my parents. are going to. die one day i don't want. to disappoint them i think you got to. be honest wow i think you got to. be honest and i think and i think here's the deal. i don't think you should come. out and be like listen. mom and dad no spin moves. no spin moves necessary yeah. do you would you recommend. a spin move on. this one no not with the face. okay so i think what you would. do i don't think you need to. like make it a whole sit down. i don't think you need to. make it a whole moment. but i think if act the way you want to. act and then if it comes up. if they bring it up. whatever then you tell them. maybe bit by bit again. i don't think you need to. make a whole [ __ ] sitdown moment. of it like an intervention. or something yeah yeah yeah yeah making it less. dramatic as possible exactly just be like i'm grown. out of it or or i'm thinking maybe i'm i'm feeling like this. you don't need to. be like i don't believe in the [ __ ] you believe and [ __ ] you yeah you can just be like look that's what i'm saying no spin moves right i'm getting a lot like i'm starting to. maybe think i think other things like and if they don't want you. to i guess pun sort of intended. because i realized it. go with god on it then that's on them. but i i think if you start out like look i'm sort of starting. to expand my mind. a bit and starting to. think maybe i don't believe in this. maybe i believe in that. whatever there's a way. to make it soft. to drop the bomb but not so much. destruction maybe at maybe at uh like family dinner you're just eating and you know everyone's having a good time. so this jesus guy huh. you really that all are you all. really that all into. it i'm just saying there's no proof. but you know what i mean. you could just do that. i'll just say where's the proof and then we could we could move. on and then i'll agree with it. so some of the proof and then it's all good. so but the chicken's really good you know. you could do that yeah. i mean what if you did. that and you realize no. one actually believed they were just waiting. for one person to. say that and they're like oh [ __ ] thank god mark you finally said something that would be uh yeah it could go yeah you don't know how you could go that way you don't know how it's going to. go but my point is it also it here's another thing. that i'm going to. raise because i'm very smart i'm going. to raise this point it. depends really how old your parents. are like you keep like bringing something up. like if you're if he's 15. right and his parents. are 40. yeah that's a long. time those parents are going to. be alive you can work through. issues but if you're if they're 80. and he's 45 he's the same. age as harrison ford. if they're 80 and he's 40 yeah. their parents might croak in two years. it's not worth it to. leave them [ __ ] shitty in the past. two years thinking that their son's gonna be in the very tips. of hell uh okay. but he or she i guess. do we know if i don't know okay. i don't know i'm sexist. he or she uh they're gonna have to. live longer yeah than their parents. and maybe they would have liked to. have been known by their parents. more maybe they're going. to live with the idea. of well what if i told them. i should have told them. lived my true life. because it is a big. [ __ ] deal i mean what if this person has to. go to [ __ ] church and like pray and say grayson they really don't want. to it's not it. doesn't feel good to. have to go along with some religious. [ __ ] when you don't believe in it i feel like really yeah i know but like also everyone seems like it's like everyone is like complaining about everything and all you got to. do is like sit at church. for an hour and be like oh yeah you know. every week though yeah but it's like you're with your parents. who gives a [ __ ] if it's nice for them. they're just like cool yeah. oh yeah and on the third. day uh you know what i mean. they're just sitting there they just gotta do that. it's not they gotta do manual labor. and build a [ __ ] church. they just gotta be like oh yeah. yeah and also with you i think you should tell him. but i think he or she should tell him. i think he should test. the waters at at least. at the outset not to. drop the bomb and just be like i don't believe. in this [ __ ] it's all [ __ ] but to. just sort of ease into. it uhoh what i got the [ __ ] absolute this. goes deeper than what we're even. talking about right now okay church. needs to be more fun yeah well i agree. with that that's it dude. you've been to. a black church i haven't but i've seen it. on [ __ ] racist movies. and dude it's like they go [music]. or whatever they don't [ __ ] they don't do that. they don't sing that [ __ ] song. that's for sure why why did you do. that you know whatever. it is dude what's that. [ __ ] you're doing it again. it's the same thing you're doing. dude or what okay. i know they do that. one where it goes. [music] that's not something either. i'm sorry but you're not singing. real songs that's not they do. no oh my lord and then they do this. and if you're doing this. and then what happens. is they do a few ones. loud like that and then they get quiet. and they go oh my lord. okay and then someone speaks and they're like jesus. i would like to. let you know that yada. yada and everyone in the background. so do you think he should talk. to his pastor but what i'm saying. is and then that guy finishes. and he's like and that's what i mean. and then they go oh my lord. they get louder again have you seen. glory so the point is make church. more fun maybe you can involve him. in the way that you never even. thought you could right. and then he's sitting eating chicken with his family. and he's like god damn. you know and he said maybe i don't believe. in jesus but [ __ ] we sure did [ __ ] lay that dance floor. flat right okay but church. isn't gonna just get more fun bob's saying it's not tomorrow but they've had [ __ ] 2 000. years i don't think it's gonna get more fun any time. soon invite the [ __ ] you know what i mean. invite david gray to. church and have him do it. and he's like the [ __ ] babylon guy leave me on leave me your hand. i mean [ __ ] awesome [laughter] i died. for our sins hey. i mean i'd rather go. to that church than [ __ ] what's up. and ever and ever yeah. that [ __ ] is so whacked yeah i mean if he's catholic. he's [ __ ] so don't tell your parents. if they're 80 if they're 40 tell them and then repair it that's my advice. yeah but still when you tell i think you got to. tell them i think you got to. tell them full stop i think you got to. tell him keep going okay. i think you got it i think you got to. tell him and that's it. but dude see that's good okay. all right anyway wow hey how's it. going chris and matt um today. i'm i want to. ask you guys about two of my friends. who just recently. uh joined a frat and they're going. through the pledging process and um you know joining fras just a dumb. [ __ ] i just want to. get your guys input on. on what to. do because i i see them. a lot less and less. and they are changing so how do i how do i sort of wake them. up out of this. natty light sort of haze that they're going. through and then what are some things. i can do to. get my friends back it's it's like they got a girlfriend and and um yeah yeah they're both just sort of out. for the count thank you guys. um and yeah i appreciate it. all of it have a good. one oh my god the end. that was the sickest thing. i had it was like a butt. head move uh i think that um rats. suck yeah they they do suck. but it's hard though i guess if you're in college. and you feel like you're not here's the thing. frats weed out the people. who are weak if you need a group. to tell you you're good. and accepted you are weaker. than someone who doesn't period. so this guy is stronger than his friend. and honestly it's not even. necessarily that he's realizing his friends. don't need him as much. because they're with their new tribe his enemies. are being exposed and i think that sometimes. if you can't beat him. join them so start your own. frat dude start your own. frat and call it absolutely. nunca or whatever the [ __ ] you want to. call it i was with you until nunca. it means i think it. means nothing it's bad. it does it does yeah. there you go absolutely absolutely nothing. absolutely nunca that's pretty good yeah. dude and be like here at absolutely nunca. we [ __ ] do not have a frat but come on over. here if you're not in a frat. and we'll kind of secretly start. our own frat but we don't have any rules. and you can do whatever. you want you can live wherever. you want to. but this guy's not considering joining. a frat himself no. he's not he's just annoyed. or upset or frustrated. that his other friends. have and they're starting. to change yeah he's asking how can i get my friends. back i tell you right. now you can't um they're gone. you you know what how to. how do you get your friends. back they're gone you can't how do you get friends. back just get some new ones. get new ones that aren't in frats. you can't be in [ __ ] no yeah i mean like i said it's kind of like being in a religion it's like a little mini cult. that everybody's just sort of okay. with that at college and you know. what dude they're way more fun. than church right they do. a lot dude honestly maybe not hanging upside down maybe i'd rather. be a church than a [ __ ] frat party. yeah well i would for sure yeah no frat. parties are not baptize me. place to be yeah baptize me before. you [ __ ] hang me upside down over a [ __ ] beer yeah what do you call it beer. uh what do you call. them those things where you hang out. upside down and keg keg stand. never knew it because never was a part. of it yeah well good for you. but you need more friends. this is a good thing. for you dude this is a good. thing it's also just part. of like he looks like he's around. the age where you start. to lose some friends. and gain new ones because you're not. a kid anymore totally you're becoming an adult. you will make new friends. i do know what it's like to. be like man i'm kind of growing. away from my old. friends and before you've made new good friends. but i promise you yeah. you will make new friends. and they will be better. friends especially when you think back yep. on the [ __ ] guys who are in a frat. you're like oh my god thank god. i didn't need to. be friends with those [ __ ] frat guys totally you lose. friends two times in your life. once when you leave high school. and you get to. be in college right. and another time is like when you turn 40. and all your friends. backstab you so you want to. do the next one i guess three times also when you die. you lose all your friends. yeah you do do it. but maybe you join all your friends. in heaven that were your friends. who died early okay. next one hi chris and matt. is taylor i'm from toronto. canada and i am graduating from university. this year we are having a graduation. ceremony at the university this summer. but i don't really want to. go because it's just going. to be full of [ __ ] speakers. and people pretending that they care. about our future and it's just going. to be super long yeah. so that's why i don't want to. go don't go but my parents. really want me to. go they haven't said it but i can kind of tell when i tell them. i don't want to. go they get a little upset. so do i just go and make them happy. or do i just stick. to what i want to. do and tell them. that i'm not doing it. thanks for your help. they want her to. go they want her to. go to her own. graduate was it the graduation. she's asking about yeah yeah yeah yeah they why do her. parents want her to. go she doesn't get that i don't do because parents care about like ceremony and she's like that. [ __ ] man it is old school but that's what she's dealing with you know what she's calling in any ceremony sucks any awards show. sucks any kind of thing. where you have to. join or volunteer it all. sucks just be you dude. be you your parents should understand. that you need to. be you and if you don't want to. go to your graduation then. don't go to your graduation man. i don't know graduation i have another perspective. okay it's wrong but okay. there i don't know do we know. if it's college or high school. well i guess so we don't know. yeah either way if your parents. [ __ ] paid like they get nothing for all the money that they've spent that is your [ __ ] ungrateful especially now these times you're not grateful. but like in these times all it. is is [ __ ] three hours of time. suck and it's gonna make them. [ __ ] happy maybe just [ __ ] do it and bite the bullet you know what i mean because like they might have spent [ __ ] 200 grand on that [ __ ] yeah god they shouldn't have huh no they should not have done that but that's on them you know what maybe you're right maybe you just don't go because that's on them and they shouldn't spend yeah but also i get what she's saying it's it's actually adorable that she even like is thinking about should i go for my parents because most i feel like a lot of people would be like [ __ ] them [ __ ] my parents she obviously has a good relationship. with her parents right. it really seems like it. yeah just with the way she's talking. about it yeah you know. i guess we don't know. but um yeah i think that uh i i hate especially the ceremony dude. because everyone gives a speech and it's always like this. yeah yep and the greater times. in a future yeah but we haven't asked. that anna yet they don't. ever [ __ ] talk like listen. guys we're all out here and this. is not about it yeah. you gotta jazz it up. dude you're just scattered i know. yeah i do but i understand. why she doesn't want to. sit there with these boring.

he's even better. this guy's kind of killing. it he's good looking yeah. hey guys love the new podcast. i'm glad matt is here. to keep chris in check because as much as i love. congratulations let's be honest he sometimes. get lost in the sauce. so i met this. girl we're both crazy in love but she's a nurse. in a native community. in a nordic village in quebec. so she's basically only here in montreal. for half of the year. we had an open. relationship and we're managing it. well but we recently decided to. be exclusive so i was wondering what do. you guys think about open. relationships can it really work. long term chris i can't. wait till you get back. to montreal and i'm curious. to hear you guys opinion. have a good one. thanks that guy hit. one note and his whole fat. guy sounds like he was drowning. so that's sexy though for real. i think that guy's [ __ ] sexy yeah i mean i would he's a cool now. you're jealous well i'm not. jealous i think that. you shrugged and you're like well. he's not as sexy. as me but he's no. i think that you're just you're falling. victim to he's got an accent. yeah maybe but i think he kind of looked like robert. pattinson too though he's sexy. bro he doesn't look. anything like that i think we need to. trust me on who people look. like more because you didn't even. know the [ __ ] leonardo dicaprio. two out of three people didn't know. that that was interrupted well. guess what i was right. okay well but sometimes you cannot look like yourself. right but i was right. do you ever see colin. farrell in the batman he doesn't look like himself. because he's got prosthetic and [ __ ] makeup on so that guy's handsome and sexy period. have you been in open. relationships no i have been in open. relationships and it's just very hard to. navigate dude it's not. easy and he was in an open. relationship and now he's not with the girl i think that that's i think that's progress. i think that if you start with an op. with with a nonopen relationship exclusive and then go open. i don't think that that's progress. i think that's whatever the opposite. of yeah right right right. um but but you can have a successful. open relationship i suppose but you definitely need to. have clear rules and only go. by these rules you can't. stray from these rules. right yeah you can't. be like okay you you can be like look these are. the rules don't date. anybody i know don't do the horizontal. mamba with anybody i know don't [ __ ] you could have throw out a weird rule. i don't like when you [ __ ] with hockey players. i know everyone loves hockey into. montreal steeper but but you can say. uh but then you can't go back. on that you go. back on that the whole thing. is [ __ ] there's no going back. right trust is everything. right and you need to. adhere to the rules. that you establish in your relationship. now everybody [ __ ] up right i've [ __ ] up in my relationships you know uh but it's very very hard to. go from exclusive to. open i think going from open. to exclu exclusive is progress. and that is uh yeah maybe you're growing. up dude you're becoming an adult. you know yeah but a guy like that. with that accent is always gonna cheat. anyway next no he's always going to. have [ __ ] plenty of women he can be with right. right right i mean he's i would [ __ ] want to. date that guy but that being said is he i i'm not sure. i was too like uh mystified. and mesmerized by him was. he saying he's considering about going. back to an open relationship. i don't think so i just think that he was asking do. you think open relationships could. work i would i have never and would never try. one yeah i know people who are in them. and happy and i i have to. believe them because they're saying it. and i i don't know better. than someone else's brain i do. not i do know. rather that i would never do that. or want to. do that or could do that. period [ __ ] full stop and why would you never do that couldn't couldn't you you have no desire no i mean if i have a partner that's the partner i want yeah and that i don't i think it's the way i think of it like i don't if i'm with someone that is the person i want to. be with and so having an open. relationship i don't even like part. of me doesn't really quite. get it well you know. thank god you're not an animal. you know what i mean. like an actual animal like you know. penguin not a penguin. penguins are monogamous you know what i [ __ ] read about penguins all look like each other you know what i read about penguins the other day this is real they [ __ ] dead penguins because the way uh sometimes penguins will die. in the position of the way. that they position themselves. when they're asking to. be mated with and then a male penguin. will go up to. a dead female penguin and [ __ ] it i mean don't shoot the messenger. [ __ ] a dead penguin penguin dead but not knowing just yep dude. hey nature figure that. out yeah well dude the [ __ ] it's a loophole dude. how about how [ __ ] penguins just dying like this. [laughter] that's yeah just just with a [ __ ] log in its mouth. with the fins like this. horny penguins coming by. i wonder what that position. really is though penguin style unfortunate unfortunate an unfortunate way to. pass just passing like this. like on the side and then the [ __ ] another la living penguin. walks up and then go right. next to it and behind it. doing it doing the [ __ ] lazy republican. behind it like this the lazy republican. yeah that's what that um that's the position. i don't know i made it. you literally right now. made it up it's called. the lazy republican for me. and what is it where you're like. this on your side. the person your mate if it's a chick. or a dude if it's gay. sex whatever but like the other person. is in front of you. and you're behind them and you're just kind of like it's doggy. style but laying down on it. and why are you a republican. you know what i mean. because because you're republican because it's like you think you're doing. something dirty but really you're just you're not because when you do. it you don't believe in climate. change no no no it's less. than that and more like ooh this is crazy. honestly republicans are the new punk rock. so i i made it unfortunately yeah yeah. i made it i made it i made it back. when republicans were like the ooh we don't do. that kind of they are still that. don't [ __ ] be full okay when when it comes to. when it comes to. the older republicans yes but the new republicans. dude don't be fooled they. still like [ __ ] believe in god no i know but they they would [ __ ] i mean they they're gonna have like the new [ __ ] woodstock soon get the [ __ ] [ __ ] out of here with who just kid rock i am kid right dude with red ties on in woodstock 1999 whatever year it was kid rock has the [ __ ] best [ __ ] oh yeah that's right what is it again it's uh it's uh you want me to. get political oh yeah monica. lewinsky's a whole and bill. clinton's a [ __ ] pia so not political the worst political. take [ __ ] ever it's one of my favorite videos. play can you play it. oh yeah that was on. the schedule but yeah so i didn't want. to but dude he has to. pull up stuff that we want to. because it's fun and we're talking about. it yeah that's so shitty. of chris rock to. do that but also [laughter]. here it is this is it. again political cr worst rock. compression okay here we go. now listen close [applause]. well this is close as deep as kid. rock thinks monica lewinsky is a [ __ ] hoe and bill clinton is a goddamn pill. well the way he's yep. so serious after unbelievable. that's what you see of people. just like he made the greatest. [ __ ] point god how many people are there and my favorite what did. he say in the beginning. listen up uh this is as deep as you want me. to get political this. is deep before that he was like listen. closely or something which was great. he did something like listen. closely which is like you don't need to. yeah i mean i missed. that part but yeah chris christopher stop doing. that you know what i mean. i don't know man you know. what i mean but i think that that's very political. dude and i think that that's great. that he's speaking his mind. yeah i think it's great. he's being political he loves. [ __ ] trump so now he does look for him. back then but he said bill. clinton is a pimp so he kind of just loves. men in charge right you know what that's what it. is yeah yep um so you think what was the [ __ ] advice. thing we were talking about. are the penguins oh you told me. about penguins but why do we start talking about open relationships. open relationships right i think that um don't do it. just yeah well don't do it. but but uh we've evolved over. the [ __ ] years in a way that it didn't prep. us for that [ __ ] and it's nobody's fault. it's not our fault but we're not. ready for that [ __ ] it's not how we do it if you insist like i said there are people who even that i know that do it and they're happy but dude. i don't call me. [ __ ] oldfashioned i do not get it. and i do not want it. either i think it can work. um i think it's very uh i need you need to. have serious delineations and lines. and uh adhere to. them and um if you have any questions. about what you should or shouldn't do. you have to. refer to your partner. first um i just think it's a lot. of work you know it. sounds like it and uh [ __ ] sounds like it i guess it could work but if you are open this. is my advice to. this guy if you're open. and then you went to. exclusive there's no going back. you that's a progression right. so that's definitely not go back. yeah that's the question do. not do that yeah imagine them. having sex with just themselves. in the middle are like man. we gotta go back. to being open yeah yeah that's crazy. about penguins they shouldn't [ __ ] dead penguins huh. the guy that discovered that. that was true hid the discovery. because he thought it was so [ __ ] up which is like so no it was just like it was so long ago. it was so long. ago yeah you know stop saying what i said. whatever you're saying yeah so now now it. would be [ __ ] literally uh on on every article and it'd be like hey guess what penguins [ __ ] deads deads. necrophiliacs yeah penguins are necrophiliacs. i knew that word you didn't i know. what it means well now you do. having sex with necro wafers [music]. oh you're doing another one. or what are we doing nah. that's good i think i'm good. yeah um you guys this has been great. phoenix arizona i'm gonna be in your city. february 30th you can go to. crystallia dot com to. get tickets i'm also doing uh april 27th. at the hollywood improv. crystallia dot com and uh i'm putting out. more dates uh be ready in the first week. of may i'm going to. be pumping out dates for uh other um cities on the on the east coast. and different cities and then um also listen. to congratulations and uh we got to. start your podcast up. soon but um that's about that. like and subscribe to. this channel and activate that algorithm. make friends in the comments. that's how we do it. and also feel free to. give advice to any of the people. that gave videos into. this show uh in the comments section and we'll like uh go in there. and pin some of them. or whatever we might not. but we might we might not. so anyway we appreciate you. is that it yeah if you want. to submit there's a link. in the description below also want. more specific questions we'd love that. more specific questions what do you mean. by that just right now they've been very general. oh they've been general yeah they have been general. i have noticed that actually get specific with it. baby ask submit ask what you need. to ask don't be afraid to. be specific yes okay cool. very good i love specificity. you know that you know. me right okay you know i don't make it about you no i know but people like it. right i understand but it's you know it's not like your thing. that you like specifically this is our show. it's 51 my show and no i don't know. 50.1 my show all right uh thanks. guys thanks for listening. like and subscribe bye [music].
