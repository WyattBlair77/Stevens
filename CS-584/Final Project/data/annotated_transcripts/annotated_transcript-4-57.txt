[ __ ] unbelievable dude this is a minute. into the video she's like [ __ ] it it's all. over facebook i don't care park. the car and she's parked like an [ __ ] she says this. is from my government you go. home and you get [ __ ] so not from the government also i don't know maybe trump would actually tweet that you know and people will be like well well yeah what a what a piece of [ __ ] this lady did you finish college did you finish college. did you know did you nothing. right there this woman is in her. 50s or 60s here's the worst. part about it she's not even. doing a good job of roasting. the guy if you're gonna be [ __ ] like what a supreme [ __ ] [ __ ] ah [ __ ] dude imagine you were married to. someone and they just did that. i mean you'd have to. divorce them your life would be a [ __ ] living hell. first of all she's she provided an i guess. she didn't have a job my thought if you do that you're gonna get fired that's it. that's it you're gonna get fired. because you can't i don't even. it's it even though. i know people are racist. like that it's so hard. for me to understand. that people actually think like that. and would talk like that like there's a level of [ __ ] that happens. sometimes or it's like i know. it's true but i still don't feel. that it's true because i don't operate. that way i mean this. woman isn't 60 maybe and she's going. china man like to. the guy on [ __ ] real this piece of [ __ ] this is the [ __ ] that the the the the bad trump made this woman feel like she was right you know wow wow it's so hard not to. be political by the way. i try harder and harder each episode. i don't even know what this. lady is doing is obviously piece of [ __ ] whether you're if you're if you think what that lady's doing. is not a piece of [ __ ] iii you're not a real person. to me that's unbelievable. so let's just not this. is not about politics. i know i said trump. once or twice in there. but jesus christ man. that is just that is just insane. are you mental for. being that way uh i i saw how oh man. trump's thing with the bible. was [ __ ] hysterical i mean did you really hold the bottle upside down i have no [ __ ] idea i know people were saying that but that's something that [ __ ] left the leftists would say and be like you know you [ __ ] a ho you [ __ ] hold it upside down and they're like latch onto the wrong thing to. be mad about which is what they [ __ ] which what the left. always does walking his tweets. dude all right you know all right. the things that the left. latches on to. and says are the problems. are not the problem the thing. that cnn reports about that. are the problems are usually not the [ __ ] actual problems and then it makes the right. be like they're [ __ ] idiots they're complain about the dumb [ __ ] and then the right gets stronger and left i don't want to. [ __ ] talk about i say i'm not political i don't want to. talk about this but anyway trump. did the [ __ ] bible thing and went to. go take the picture and do it he did. it i'm i think i saw this. online somewhere before somebody was like he he went out. from the white house to. take this photo in the midst. of protesters the day. after he was in the bunker. and people were roasting him. on twitter about being in the bunker. and you know that the reason. that he did that was because everyone was roasting. him about being in the bunker. so he was like i'll show. him and went and walked into. the midst of the protestors with the cops. tear gassing everybody to. take the picture in front of the church. to show that he's not scared. that is just how humans work. if you're acting like a baby now. the best the funniest [ __ ] thing to. me was like the symbolism of him. wanting to build a wall. and the fact that he got to. but it was around. the white house so nobody would [ __ ] drag him. out is unbelievable dude. like he wanted to. build a wall that was what. he ran on a lot. of people thought it was ridiculous. and then he got to. build a wall just with so. many more or less cubic [ __ ] feet in it just imagine just a little fence around. him just like this finally built. my wall dude that's so [ __ ] funny that's would make me feel like such a [ __ ] dude anyway so i guess the other option is voting for biden whoo man ah you know this whole. world is just so [ __ ] i mean biden can't remember what he is saying at the moment so that's your your memory yeah yeah are you ever like what did i eat for lunch. he is forgetting [ __ ] that he didn't. even say yet you know. i'm talking about so that's all so [ __ ] horrible i just need [ __ ] i don't know who could be a president. i have [ __ ] no idea dude let's get off this. [ __ ] political [ __ ] but i saw this couple on the bachelor i don't watch the bachelor i got hooked in a roped into. watching it i don't watch that. show because why the [ __ ] would i ever watch people competing for love. like you don't compete for love ever. i've never what unless you're 12. or 15 and you're trying to. compete with another 14 15 yearold like once i grew up if i'm ever going for a girl if i was ever going for a girl and my buddy was like bro i'm going for that girl i go like this this is always what i've been go ahead go ahead what the [ __ ] do i care have a fun time do the horizontal mambo with her marry her take care i don't give a [ __ ] i'm not gonna try and i'm not getting in front of friend or not even friend or not if i was at a [ __ ] bar or a club which i don't normally go to. but if i was and another guy was into. a girl and i knew and i didn't know the guy. and i thought the girl was hot. and then he's hitting on her. i go ari i'm not i don't i'm not on this. [ __ ] she likes me or she likes. you i'm not involved with this. [ __ ] though so i don't even care. when there's not cameras on it. putting cameras on some [ __ ] that i don't give a [ __ ] about makes me even more not give a [ __ ] about it because then you're sitting down to. watch it and ready. to [ __ ] you know it's all event so the bachelor to. me blows [ __ ] donkey dicks okay i would never watch it now reality tv is a weird [ __ ] thing because literally like only girls like it and gay guys but like no dude and ironic or not dude i don't when some guys get together like you you have a bachelor bachelorette night and it's funny bro you're boring in your dorky dude get a real personality don't pretend you like the bachelorette and watch it you know so so i got roped into. watching this and you know. my girls like oh you got a you know. just watch it and i it was like a [ __ ] twohour reek it was like a it's like a thing on i don't know hulu or some [ __ ] it's like a two hour of quick version of the season and catching up. where they are now and [ __ ] so i'll wash it. a little bit of it. and i saw this couple sean lowe and catherine lowe okay and they're so goddamn actually adorable that it's made me be like well what the goddamn [ __ ] man because they're so like she's so cute. and so sweet and he is so exactly. the kind of guy that i would want to. like be around and hang it hang out. with i mean there's one weird. thing about him was i think he was like saving. he was like a bornagain. virgin because he wanted. to save himself from marriage. to two he didn't want. to have sex with the person. until they married because you used to. be a player or something. and then he like gave up that. lifestyle cuz he thought i'd never get a i'll never get a girl. if i keep living this way which is crazy. i always think that's crazy. when guys say that like you know. i'm gonna do matter so you put a blue. sex on the back. burner but true like a real person. and then dude then you lead. yourself into. a place where you're like oh i really like this. chick i think i really like to. check and then you have sex. with her and then god forbid it's like you're having sex. with [ __ ] dry toast and you're an even worse. sometimes she's not an even the problem. you're the problem with her you're like oh [ __ ] i'm the problem. here i don't know how to. [ __ ] do it with her and then you love the girl but the sex is bad. and you're like you know. what i think i still make it worth. work you get down on one. knee and then after that you have kids. and then it sucks and the [ __ ] is all like you know hohum because the sex. was never that good i thought that. sex wasn't the most important. thing in a relationship and it's so one of the most important. things in a relationship man and guess what dude. your boy bangs it out. and i've got my own moves. i don't do it like how they do it. how they show it. on tv and [ __ ] i saw one [ __ ] show the other day a movie the other day huh. it was it's called an ax it's with that. guy who's in all those british. movies and this girl who used to. be a model and now she's an actress who's so hot. by the way sasha loose. and they [ __ ] each other and it's like what are they doing. dude she clears the table and then he throws. her on the table with her. clothes on and then her clothes. were still on so he like takes her. off the table and he rips. our clothes off and it's like relax. dude you'll get there dude. part of [ __ ] is before the [ __ ] part of the fun of [ __ ] is before the [ __ ] dude everything before the thing that actually happens is more fun. than the thing that actually happens. that's it do it put that. on my tombstone everything that happens. is not as fun. as before it happens you've been to. a bangin party yeah what was more. exciting than that driving. on the way to. the party man what's gonna happen. all in your head man. is gonna be checks dude. how many 12 probably really. yep hot ones 12 hot ones. and they're gonna be all single 11. of them are get the [ __ ] out really and you get there and there's [ __ ] two hot chicks and one has to. leave early and the other one hooks up. with [ __ ] who's the guy from nick stahl. the terminator guy cuz he's at the party. the guy who everyone pretended was missing. for [ __ ] five years and then he was he was just like yeah he's just taking it is you know and and so so anyway i watched this [ __ ] bachelor thing and anyway he did the and and they're just so [ __ ] cute. and funny dude. and i saw the guy's instagram. sean lowe pro the guy. says the funniest [ __ ] about his kids. he had his third daughter. he had his third kid. which is a daughter and he was like everyone. every every parent says there's something like every parent says they don't i don't have the faith they. they pretends like they don't. have their favorite kid. or whatever and i'm so proud to. say that i finally have mine. and he's holding his daughter like that's hilarious. i love that couple men. so i don't so listen. [ __ ] the bachelor and the bachelorette i don't even know which one it was that would they were on but that that couple i'm with them. till the end dude. i'll ride with them till the wheels. fall off and that's the thing. too that's life i was like on this. [ __ ] the bachelor [ __ ] the bachelorette [ __ ] and i saw that and i don't have an open mind dude my mind is closed shut man you know how my mind is narrow my mind's like a tight [ __ ] dude but i saw it i was in a certain mood and i felt a certain way about it and now life is about change life is about growth. but guess what after that it's like that. [ __ ] thing the it can cheat congeals like when an alien gets shot and then it my mind's back. closed as [ __ ] after i saw that. those little [ __ ] that couple sean and catherine lowe and then i saw that oh the [ __ ] terminator where he's like bong bongbongbong and there's a big like crescentshaped hole and his arms hanging off and then it [ __ ] congeals back and they starts walking forward again i'm back to. narrow my tight [ __ ] mind and we look them. up they're cute dude. and it's all about being cute. um okay so also i'm gonna do ads. but also it was very cool. how [ __ ] one fire said do you want me to. add some stuff on the notes. for you six days ago. and i said sure why not didn't add. one thing cool one. fire um man. that's what's up i was. in i was in i told you like this. new clothing line represent i wore. that shirt last week and then i got the i bought. these other shirts and i'm wearing it. right now i think i'm between. a large and a [ __ ] extralarge and that's where i always am i mean. this kind of fits this. is not an ad. by the way that's good it. fits i think i'm a large anyway. the guy emailed me because i talked about on the podcast. he was like i were gonna send you some shirt. so i said okay. and then i said you own. my address he never wrote. me back so how the [ __ ] knows but whatever who cares i like the shirts. i don't go bad on people. just because they don't even a back. some people go bad on people. when they don't email back. or don't text back although if you're real. good friends with someone and then they don't do. that [ __ ] that's weird like adam devine did that [ __ ] to. me bro [ __ ] text me back um uh anyway yeah there's some juicy hot gossip for you yeah dude [ __ ] would hit me back constantly and now i guess [ __ ] he's got that jacksie money but so what else oh dude the [ __ ] look at this [ __ ] the [ __ ] that i write in my notes that i later have no idea what it means like zero idea what this could possibly mean the hierarchy of guys and [ __ ] worst novel of all time the hierarchy of god but one of the [ __ ] like a dianetics with that font. and [ __ ] with a volcano on it and if you look closely. it's a enough it's a it's a penis. [ __ ] coming so crass um dude i saw joker finally i saw joker finally and it is so [ __ ] good and i know everybody thinks that and everyone says that but jesus. christ man here's what i think i could do that i could be that guy and i can have the [ __ ] uprising that that character. has and i think honestly it. starts with this [ __ ] podcast and thank you beforehand. because i know these [ __ ] the babies dude. these [ __ ] would listen you you you listen. right now in your [ __ ] car or probably at home. because it's sad and you can't. go anywhere unless you're in missouri. but you you're my baby. man and if i ever get in a [ __ ] insane asylum. you come and you break. me out man because i need you dude. i'm not staying in that. [ __ ] because what i'm doing it's all i'm not evil okay. oh what i think is that's what they did. about that movie that was so good. they made you feel for that. dude and he was a psychopath. killer but the whole world. is different for me. now that i have my son. man i watch everything. different before i had my son. when i saw joker i'd be like had this. [ __ ] guy wow that's badass. that's crazy now that i have my son. i see everyone as somebody's [ __ ] kid. and i get sad. dude i watched joker and i got sad. because i'm like man this [ __ ] especially cuz he had to. part with his mom in it. and i'm like i just kid. he was just a boy. at one point you know. i want to. say everyone should have kids because it [ __ ] it changes. your [ __ ] world and i hate when people say that but it's so true man. everyone was somebody's [ __ ] kid once even the joker even the joker. even the real joker but yeah. god joaquin phoenix was so good the whole movie so good todd. phillips i don't even understand. how you it's so hard. to make a movie that's so sound. and wrapped up in its own. world and everything makes sense. in that world that's created. and when it's quoteunquote a real. movie like a movie that tries. to be real i think it's in a way. even harder like take the matrix12. me a great example. of the movie that is that. creates a world and then adheres to. all the rules in its world. and there's no like false. moments i mean maybe there's one or two i don't know how to. see it again but it makes sense. within itself you know people argue that like star wars. is like that i don't really watch star. wars but like you know. it's like a philosophy and it's hard. to do that in a scifi movie. obviously but it's also in a way. easier because you could just make [ __ ] up you know that's why i don't like a lot of scifi. movies because they'll be like [ __ ] the world's inning. and the leg yeah well we and they just invented this. thing like oh really yeah. oh let's use it. well the thing is it's only on [ __ ] mars oh well let's go to. mars well the only way we can get there. now because the fucking's ors and nots exploded. the [ __ ] things where we got to. go back in time ah [ __ ] how do we do that well there's the thing there's a device okay i didn't know that yeah well they just made it when in the future what oh i just came back to. tell you this oh okay. so you're not born yet. now and then if people are like did you [ __ ] you know dorks with black sabbath shirts or just eating popcorn like well i mean this is [ __ ] amazing and so but the joke. to do it in a real movie. is is in a way harder. because people are expecting realness it's like when people talk about the chris no. christopher nolan batman about the joker and how it was. real like okay yeah it did. kind of adopt a realness. to it but dude. at the end batman was. still [ __ ] flying around from building. the building and like had technology. that didn't exist but the joker joker rather. didn't do that it was all. stuff that could possibly. happen and the world that they created. in that world was all. truthful and it was just [ __ ] an amazing movie. man and todd phillips came. to see me do standup. like a few weeks. before joker came out and i was like i can't. wait to see a movie. and i finally saw it. and i don't know if he [ __ ] will hear this. but dude i i mean. i'm talking about i can't. stop thinking of that movie i can't. stop thinking about that movie. and how good it was and here's what i think. too should've won. best picture i didn't see. all the things but i saw a parrot. a parasite and that movie was good it moves. very good it i think best. screenplay okay give it to. parasite fine but that movie was great but joker was great and also entertaining i thought parasite was a little bit and you know this could i'm sure this was intentional it was a little bit harder. to watch because but but just every moment. a joker was just like and it. was it was it got away. with being relevant socially and also entertaining which is like so [ __ ] hard anyway whatever enough of that. since we're talking about movies. let's talk about [ __ ] james bond i watched this video the other day. oh my [ __ ] dude this killed me do it there's a video on youtube. called seven inappropriate moments. james bond wouldn't get away. with now and it's on it's the pages. digital spy and they just go. through seven moments that it wouldn't know they're like some of them. with sean connery and the other guys and [ __ ] but dude i just love it how times change turns a woman around says man. talk and then slaps her ass and she walks away. they would imagine if daniel craig. did that in [ __ ] quantum leap. or whatever the [ __ ] it is condom. soulless for [ __ ] sake dude why do they name [ __ ] movies something that you would never know what it is i don't know what quantum is i don't even barely know what solace is put them shits. together or a ghost protocol dude you know go [ __ ] yourself ghost protocol yeah alright dude just call the movie jumping around tom hanks tom [ __ ] cruise whatever did all his old ran off a bit that's so dude tom cruise is such a [ __ ] big good successful actor that he's like no and stuntman dude i've done it all i've [ __ ] every kind of thing in the world and i've made all the money tie me up i'm swinging through that building so here's the other one jesus so loud here's another one when he tells he does the look what he tells the black guy oh what turns to. the black guy and says fetch my shoes. so racist here's another one. oh this [ __ ] the indian. with a bunch of a bunch of indian. guys keep you in curry. for a few weeks. i don't even really know. honestly what that means if there's a few worries like slapping. women which is just crazy to. me this is the best. one though i thought as in worst. one in an illogical and offensive. plan james attempts to. blend in with the locals in japan. by becoming japanese thanks. to a bad wig. fake tan eyebrow extensions. and some false id. lids dude what is this [ __ ] austin. powers i didn't realize how [music]. and then he walks in he meets you. and he says like who walks into. the undercover to. the lady and he says bombo ah and he doesn't even really look more japanese like there's another one where he uses [ __ ] he doesn't take no for an answer and where's another one there was another good one i thought no no that one this just makes me uncomfortable tries to. rape a lesbian okay oh this was the one where he [ __ ] puts the dwarf in a suitcase oh disconnected were he puts the dwarf in a suitcase dude like he's fighting is that even the right thing to. say dwarf it does what. do you do vo says. in a fistfight with a dwarf. james ridiculously traps knick. knack in i mean the fact that he's called. knick knack anyway you know. before carrying him out of the room. and he's fighting he like he's just like walking. towards him with the suitcase and then just [ __ ] and they caught they cut it to. him already in the suitcase. obviously because it would be [ __ ]

[ __ ] is a piece of [ __ ] because he did the blackface in 2001. you really think jimmy fallon. doesn't deserve everything he got. because because of that i know. jimmy fallon i mean. i've met him i don't know. twice the guy's the nicest [ __ ] now apparently i don't know i'm really well i mean obviously i don't know him. really well not apparently i don't know. malheur well but like these [ __ ] terry crews what he said about the about what'd. he say about the [ __ ] terry crews black supremacy let me google it. stands his ground wow. he stands his ground. i got to read. this terry crews this is on newsminer comm terry crews found himself. urging against groupthink monday defeating white. supremacy oh god this is annoying. his [ __ ] to. get the full story select an option. below email password bro [ __ ] you i'm not signing up for news dude. news is news you're lucky. i'm not on twitter oh you only go to. twitter i'll [ __ ] go to. twitter stupid [ __ ] pay for news and [ __ ] here we go la times does this work terry crews himself yeah here here it's free here pay for [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] you news it's news defeating white supremacy without white people creates black supremacy equality is the truth. like it or not we're all in. this together people [ __ ] a lit him up for this obviously it's obviously a dumb way to. say this okay but you know what the [ __ ] he's saying for people to. just be like alright this [ __ ] [ __ ] him forever it's just so weird to. me it's just so weird. to me that whole cancel cultures thing. he took this time to. respond to a few people godfrey. said godfrey comedian i love you. as a friend brother terry but i disagree. with you hundred percent. no such thing as black supremacy. right well no [ __ ] there's definitely such thing as black supremacy. that is a tactic that racist. white used i've actually never even. heard the term before until he said it. but to counteract our rebellion. to their horrific treatment. of us it's called gaslighting. black pride is an ant antiwhite yeah. agree ted cruz says i agree i'm not discussing white. people here there are gatekeepers of blackness with our own. community who decide who's black and who's not i have often been called. out for not being black enough. how can that be kevin powell responds terry with all. due respect given your platform you cannot. just post something like that. even remotely suggest that black. people would fall into. black supremacy this is what i agree. with that for sure if we battle. white supremacy without white. people yeah i agree with that. i think he just [ __ ] he's just a he puts. his foot in his [ __ ] mouth on twitter all the time. kevin i've learned that people in this. book terry says kevin i've learned. that people will take anything. you say and twist it for their own. evil anything i mean yeah i agree with that too yeah see there's the other thing. terry crews please he tweet says please. know that everything i've said comes. from a spirit of love. and reconciliation for the black community. first then the world as a whole. in hopes to. see a better future. for black people like i believe that. he thinks that so that should be it. you know we should just [ __ ] in everyone's trying to. do there well no not everyone but a guy. like i believe that guy. a guy like terry crews is trying. to do his best and that's very important. so anyway anyway how he [ __ ] how ripped is terry crews by the way is that guy in his 50s no he's like 40 something 50 some he could be ninety who knows why people good at they look good as [ __ ] when they're older um i don't want to. oh yeah this is the thing. i wanted to [ __ ] find and talk about the [ __ ] kevin spacey thing. i kept though i never talked about this. kevin spacey when he did they let me. be frank video this is some rideordie. shed like this is ryder. die shed and i would never god. what he did is bad. trying to [ __ ] like 15 year old boys or whatever i should don't know specifically what what he did i know there was that kid who was in the star trek series that he tried to. [ __ ] when he was like 16 i think that was specifically all i know but man the fact that kevin spacey let it go for like a year and and he wrote and he did this video where he was acting like the guy from house of cards in his own. video on youtube is just [ __ ] so rideordie that i can't even believe it. he's washing his hands. i was for christmas. eve he posts this i know. what you want yeah oh sure. they may have tried to. separate us but what we have is too. strong is too powerful i. mean after all we shared everything. you and i i told you my deepest. darkest secrets i showed you exactly. what people are capable of okay he's in his [ __ ] frank [ __ ] as house of cards and it's like he's is he gonna i'm like is he gonna confess or what the [ __ ] but he's playing this character. puts this out i've actually never watched. his over i shocked you with my honesty but mostly i challenged you. and made you think and you trusted me. even though you knew you shouldn't so we're not done. no matter what anyone says yeah. the worst [ __ ] like background music. or background talking hey the camera. shaking a little bit i don't. know what's going on dawg. the the background partygoers is so bad. that it sounds so fake. listen listen to it even though. you knew you shouldn't so we're not. done no matter what anyone says and besides i know. what you want you want. me back a man confessed. course some believed everything. and i've just been waiting with bated breath. to him he confess. at all i knew the words. bated breath was gonna be in this. by the way it's so kevin spacey to. say bated breath it's dying. to have me declare that everything said is true and that i got what i deserved wouldn't that be easy it was all so simple only you and i both know it's never that simple. it's so weird how actors are so annoying. when they're acting but then also there's like joaquin phoenix when he does the joker and you're like oh wait this. is actually [ __ ] the [ __ ] i don't understand. the difference sometimes like this. is so bad to. me it's so [ __ ] weird politics and not alive but you wouldn't believe the worst without evidence would you you wouldn't rush to. judgment without facts yeah i. mean he's talking about himself. as frank did you under what is it. a cigar not you you're smarter. than that anyway all this presumption. made for such a nun of course they're gonna say. i'm being disrespectful not playing by. the rules who wrote. this is what i want to. know dude also i didn't realize forgot. about the conspiracy where people think that he's murdering. his accusers somebody right who's hereafter wondering if kevin spacey's murdering people what did they say here or the peeps he knows doing it. for him they're all beyond. a joke at this point. see this is the stuff i just can't the conspiracy. theory [ __ ] is just so wild to. me i know i've talked about this. before but like you think kevin spacey. is hiring people to. kill his accusers dude. he would be caught okay. everyone's eyes are on him. right now right now. only italians are on our eyes. honor him and because they're there and they don't give a [ __ ] about the me
