cold last weekend. and dude it's the middle. of the week now when we're recording. this on the weekend. the day this is going to. drop it's supposed to. rain it's supposed to. rain again a don't even tell me. that kind of stuff it's so bad. dude that sucks get it. hey weather get it out of your system. and then bring in the good. stuff i don't like that either but here's here's why it. doesn't bother me the swinging. thing doesn't bother me. i just don't like it. when it rains period. but that swinging thing doesn't bother. me because i'm i'm always in a different. place so like it was freezing. in michigan and then i came back and it was really nice i want. it to be really nice what. what about i always wanted to. be really nice what about. i'm only happy when it rains. you think about that no i never have and i don't like i don't. like people who talk about the rain. like that like it's romantic. i i just don't like when it happens. i hate the rain. i was just singing. a song i can't st rain. i can't stand rain. adding so much stuff to. it between the words yeah. i'm no that's how it goes. with all the beeping yeah beeping this the beeping. yeah that song has be in it. yeah missy mdina elliot missy misina elliot oh anyway. um uh so yeah so it but the swinging. stuff doesn't really bother. me but what bothers me. is the rain period. cuz i can't stay the rain. got castrated right. before said i think it's misdemeanor. is it yeah it's miss misdemeanor. elliot it's not mdina no. oh wow you got too. creative with it no i got too. white with it that's like when people say. 50 cent so true you dude. that used to. bother me so much. when dads would be all. like 50 cent and i do it now now i'm a dad great. 44 years old and i do it. that's how it goes. you became a dad and now you say dad. stuff yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah check out. the private record subscribe get in there. do it do as i say thank you. very much a coach thank.

there's oh turn the air. off there's there's shoes. to get sorry there stairs. to get up to. the bunk bed you. know yeah and i put my shoes. on the stairs to. go upstairs when i go cuz when i go upstairs i'll bring them. and put them in my bedroom. right so if i take a downstairs i. do okay yeah um calvin. took his shoes and put them on on the stairs. of his bunk bed. and he says look dad. i put my shoes. like you do did you cry. no but it was so sweet. how often do you cry. i'm getting i'm getting good at. feeling the emotion and not c. the first two years i couldn't handle. it i bet but

it's like just they're midbrain they're just too young. they're like i got to. get the [ __ ] ball that's so interesting. so funny yeah so when calvin. did that i grounded. him yeah i me. how else is he gonna learn. how's it gonna be the next. mookie wilson wow m wilson of all people you know yeah. how's it gonna be the next. hojo [laughter] do you know what i'm saying. you remember when we used to. get an argument about whether you can say. hojo johnson the baseball player. named howard johnson was was like the best. player on the mets when we like. them howard johnson and you used to. get mad when the kids would say hojo johnson. because you're repeating the johnson. part why wouldn't i be mad. at that well why would you be why. would anybody cuz they're not being they're not thinking about what. they're saying which is fine. you don't say jo johnson six though. like the kids were young. i was doing it yeah. you weren't but i mean that you know. there's another thing like that. what is it it really. bothers me it's like you're saying it. the thing and then the yeah that that. that that's like what started it. all is just like all right. how am i not supposed. to turn into. larry david if people are going to. be doing that [ __ ] when i'm six you know. talk yeah yeah there's a yeah i mean. yeah did you you i don't remember that. but you remember that but of course i i had stuff like that. but yeah of course you do because we yeah. yeah yeah most frustrated i ever. got at a kid in school. yeah was i i i wanted. i loved the monkeys. the monkeys the band the show. really and i wanted to. play monkeys let like let's play. the monkeys like at at school. okay and this one idiot. kid here we go i said. let's play the monkeys. and i really wanted to. be mickey i loved mickey dolan the most and i said let's play. the monkeys i'm mickey right. and this idiot kid who never went. nowhere obviously because he's an idiot. okay said oh oh oh oh i'm goofy. and i was like no no. no this is the monkeys. we're going to play. the monkeys we're all going. to be different monkeys. how old are you and he said okay. okay okay okay okay okay and i said i'm mickey i was 18. no i was like five i don't. even i don't remember very young. and and he was like okay. okay okay oh i'm goofy. was it uh and i was like you know what you are. goofy you idiot was it. james who was it uh i don't even. remember his name this. kid james what when i was a kid. he obviously just saw a movie. or something like the day. before and we were swinging. on the swing set and i'll never forget. this for some [ __ ] reason dude he was swinging and he was we were jumping off you know how you get to. the point where you're like i'm gonna jump off. the swing at the end like you know and he was like dude ask me if i have any ideal what so elevated dude. socrates is a kid and i was like what he was like ask me. if i have any ideas. wow and i was like he means ideas okay you know. that's hilarious and he was like either. i was like oh okay. do you have any ideas. and he was like and then he said the line. oh you know and then jumped off and then jumped off you know. right we had to. do it a few times but he kept on saying. ask me if i have any ideal and i was like does he know it's ideas. and it's not ideals right. like cuz it was obviously. saw a movie was like jumping off with like a gun or something. right right you got and obviously you got any ideas. like you that's in a movie. obviously and and i and and let me tell you something. i think about that i don't know. if i think about it. maybe once a year or two. times a year who but i've never ever. told that to anyone. what not weird that's i held. on to it for 40. years i wonder if it's going to. going to change how often you think about it. now that you finally maybe you needed to. get off your chest it's like the end. of the m and i'm just like you let it. go yeah maybe i don't know but let's get into. some submissions but yeah that's that's wild. sign up for lifeline luxury. if you want uh b to. sick in but let's do like some let's do some uh some submissions here. we go let's do it. sup guys um my name's nick what. up nick i called. in like episode three or four. something like that my daughter. was hitting the terrible. twos and i did advice. on how to. handle that um anyway. daughter's almost four. now um just had twins which is why. i'm l five minutes of peace. i get a little rest so apologize for being disrespectful. however here's a pressing question. my wife is i live in the midwest. i live in fort way. indiana my wife insist who's from here. that it is breakfast. not lunch but dinner and then supper is the evening. oh what am i wrong. for getting blood red mad about that. uh is that normal. no moreover is it. grilled cheese like the the the sandwich. with the bread and the cheese. know what is is it a cheese. toasty oh where it's cheese toasty by. way and no one else would understand. i think it's nuts anyway. love you guys love. you too of course it's nuts. that's it's the very clear. of course it's nut. situation the cheese toasty what do you. three that's obviously something that they do. either like in the south or in the midwest. got to be a regional thing. yeah there's no no way. yeah no you don't call. it what grilled toasty is that. we saides cheese toasty in the uk. too ah hello it's a cheese. toasty sick in it ah you want. a cheese toasty a cheese toasty you grilled. the cheese on a sandwich. and you put it in there. oh so grilled cheese. that's a cheese toasty ask me. if i've got any ideas. got any ideas ah let's make a cheese toasty um all right. so that's crazy also so she thinks my question. is yeah it's yeah there's breakfast. we know in that is it's in the morning. does she think that lunch. is dinner or does. she think that there is no. lunch i and then breakfast. no lunch then dinner and then later after dinner supper. from what i understood it's just changing. the names of the din. is at lunch i guess. so and you just eat dinner. at noon he was they call. lunch dinner who some people in the south including his wife including his wife really apparently and so to. answer your question she's just calling lunch. dinner and dinner supper start. calling breakfast bedtime it's just no do that. and then and then when she gets confused. be like well we're just switching. everything right isn't and then say isn't that right. anthony mackey and she says that's that's the guy. who's play and say well we're switching. everything and then just do another name. john carlo esposito just keep changing. it because nothing means anything. in your apparently nothing means anything. in your house yeah cheese toasty um cheese. toasty is less of a problem. it's not that bad because well it. al also sounds kind of appetizing you know your kids. are going to. get confused this is the problem. they're going to go. into the and say i can't wait for dinner. to their friends at you know. 11: a.m. and they're going to. think she's talking about 5:00. p.m. but she's really talking about two or whatever. and then and then what if you throw brunch. into it everything's all [ __ ] up honestly don't call lunch you can't even call brunch. if it's that case you're right. you're right you're right who which person. him he's right oh of course he's right. yeah we're right yeah everyone's right. accept your wife you would because everyone would agree. with us and no one would agree. with your wife yeah by the way. i met in i think it. was grand rapids i guess. it could have been in sagen the guy. who gave the first submission. in lifeline really yeah he's like dude. i was the first submission. in lifeline i was like really what was it. do you remember uhuh no. look such an idiot the way. you said uhuh no. he he told me. though he told me. what it was and then i go oh such an idiot. the way you said oh i go. oh yeah and i remembered com. kind of i think and then i i i don't now. i don't remember wow w. look at episode one look how look how looks like it. was in the we were like i was 12. years old when i did that no no it was only dud. think about this what so it's this. is episode 105 right. is that right episode 104 was the mark of two. year two full years. of episod crazy let's get our first caller. hey guys so i have a conundrum that. really un addressed um i mean. i've been friends with this guy for a really long time. i trust him with my life. we've been through thick. and thin together but here's the situation i start. talking to this girl. right and because i remember i don't remember at all. i gave him my phone. so he can look through. her pictures on facebook. now the thing is we know. that there are unwritten rules. when it comes to. this exchange and absolutely under no. circumstance can you like an old picture. from a girl job not even instagram. where a double tap. is something that could you have to. hit the thumbs. it's to a point. where i just have to. trust that my good friend. knows these rules but this. is a type of blunder that really. can't go unpunished wow so my question. for you is what should his punishment. be to fully we don't. need to actually but i have an update. i have an update okay. okay cool the update is. he was like you didn't you. he's like the thing that you asked. was was it by mistake or intentional. yeah yeah of course and then he told me. he said whatever it was and i can't. remember oh my god come on dude. it's the only part of the story that. matters it's not actually cuz there's one more thing that he updated me on okay you're his dad that's my son i told him i said well so whatever happened with the chick and he said didn't work out and then pointed to. a woman and said but that's my fiance. now hey so we really helped. him he's happy now. in large part to. us so i don't remember what the [ __ ] he said was about he said i think he said i think he said it was intentional. like a joke and i de him. out yeah gone yeah all right next one. all right all right this. is what it's going to. be okay so tonight i ran. grabbed my hand and it really. hurt because i have a what we call you can't really see it. h but what we all. has to be orientation the video. it is vertical it's vertical. oh it has to. be vertical wow these two you're wasting. time she got great teeth. huh so we all call. this a hang nail. yeah which makes no sense. it's not a nail. and it's not well it's not a nail. no and it's definitely not hanging. so hanging it's it. is skin that ripped. next to your cuticle yes. so i've got a new word. rute rute i don't know rip what. and it's a new word. and i'm going to. trade market and you heard it. here first on live and i'm hoping it'll be word. of the year but i want a trade. market for money any other ideas rute i don't know yeah rute give us more ideas riute is love you guys very much by not easy or good to. say but riute is terrible. rip is cool i mean. that's too ripkin cow. ripkin ripkin rumple stil skin was was that. rumple stil skin yeah um r. rip skin dude. rip skin that could be anywhere. though you need r skin. sounds like a transformer. you need to. have something rip skin. nail even cuticle in there. because it you need to. okay address the location. okay it's kind of hanging though it's a hang nail. dude hang nail's fine. it's not a nail. though is the thing it's not your nail. it it's your skin that's the thing. and i totally agree with that. who why do we need bring a good. point so we need one word for it. here's why it's good to. say hang my skin's coming off here's why. it's good to. say hang now what when you say. hang now every single person. knows right i know but that's because we he's saying but we picked the wrong. thing to call at night. understand that and i i don't even disagree. but to go back. and try to. uproot all all of everything. everyone knows about hang nails. is not worth it. it's like you don't recreate. language just because oh wait it. actually doesn't work perfectly. like everyone i think you do okay. well we don't i i i think you do. because what what's happening. is what about the first. person who called in the cheese. toasty uhhuh you know the the the the dinner. for lunch right but what happens. is people who say the wrong. thing everyone else around. them says the right thing and then they have to. say the right thing from then on because no one will understand. them we're like them except that guy. nick who clearly has weird. issues cuz he allowed. himself to marry a woman. that says cheese toasty instead of grilled. cheese i just think that. yeah i think that that's uh i think hangnail. i'll just keep saying hangnail. i just taught my son. what a hangnail is so he he can't go. to sleep he if he has a hangnail. it hurts no he's just like i got a boo. boo and i'm like so italian. so italian way does it. i'm like no it's not it's a hang now. and he was like what is it. can you get it off. i was like don't pick. it i got to. do it so i come in and i do it. you know yeah it's so awesome. being a dad though even doing that. kind of stuff makes my day. c's a really good kid. man yeah william is gonna be one william is one. now the day came out yeah. happy birthday william yep uh all right. next one hey chris and matt. my name is nicole. nico i'm from long island. chris i saw your show last year. at the beacon theater. and it was great and patiently come back. to new york in the future. um i'm looking for some advice. because i am going on. my first solo trip in a few. weeks uh my job is sending me. to a conference in new orleans. and while i will be there. for the conference i'll still have a lot. of downtime to. enjoy myself and i'm looking for some advice. on how to. best utilize my free time. uh how to. really make the best of of this. trip trip and um how to. not be afraid and alone. in a city i've never been to. before where's the city. any advice is appreciated love. you guys love the show. christ it's good to. be careful especially there i was going. to say new orleans that it's a cool. city if you know what to. do where to. go or you're with the right. people but it's a good. it is a i don't want to. say afraid but it's a good. place to be careful. dude you see you go. to new orleans you're shocked how many guys aren't lil wayne. you're like oh oh no. no never mind it's i mean. it is unbelievable it is so wild. well i haven't been there in a long. time people are true showing tits. people are just it's just insane. it it's definitely best to. go not during is it. marty it is yeah um which it sounds. which it's not yeah uh and uh yeah that's crazy. when it's funny when you said um solo trip. i was like oh she's going. on a vacation to. alone and i've never done. that and that's interesting because i have friends. that do that like that sounds so nice. i've never done it. either why have i never done that. i think it sounds so nice. shane did it shane. west did it recently. you would hate it. of course uh uh uh uh denny love. does it all the time. cool and oh and i think lulu does. it too but i i i i've never done. that and to. me that's so [ __ ] i don't do i not like myself or what is it no well we are the obviously i think people think we're really really similar but we're so different this might be the way that we are the most most most different right i'm i'm not like antisocial right but i oh not always but so so so often want prefer to. be alone okay and you never ever want. to be alone you don't. want to be alone. what's up with that if i i i can be alone. now home but if i'm out dude. show me the people what's up. man i don't you know. and i don't like when people bug. me of course it's like you it's a little bit i don't want. it but i do want. it but like yeah i i i um i don't know. i go on the road a lot. and usually i people with me. but sometimes i don't like sometimes. i i go alone. and um you know what i do. you know what i do. you know what i suggest. as she's going to. be in orleans i don't know how long she's going. to be there i'm not in places. for crazy long i don't what your life's. like use that time to. chill don't i don't have a plan. i i have a plan and then what if you don't want. to do it you go. and you're like i said i'd do this. i should go do this. thing and i don't like all. that [ __ ] go and operation chill that's what it should be operation chill operation i'll do what i want when i want that's a longer one operation chs better but oper that's better. operation do what i want when i want. operation chill mean it. could be misconstrued to. mean like don't leave your hotel. or something you don't no. but that's not what i mean. exactly so i should be operation. do what i want when i want. is what i'm saying suggesting it's too. long to say if you're on a mission. you say it's operation. do what i want when i want. you get shot by. then so you go operation. chill and you miss and the bullet. hits the wall well she's not going. to going to going. syria she's not going to. syria um well syria xm. um so so i think every time serious. so uh i guess yeah i think chill. i think allow you know. what dude allow yourself to. chill dude uh who's the beetle. the john well there's four of them. so that could be it. the the the main one imagine the main one imagine movie imagine john lennon. john lennin said uh every when you hang out. i mean speaking of the first dude. you're this is crazy whatever it was that. he said he was like somebody. out there put an edit together. of the him in the first episode. trying to quote john lenin time. enjoyed is not wasted or something. but that's a good way. to say it if you didn't say. that that's a good way. to say it time enjoyed is not wasted. you know and don't feel bad about not doing. [ __ ] if you're enjoying yourself also in r. that's good advice in general. don't feel like always have to. be doing something when you're on vacation. it's okay to. just enjoy being where you are. without like going to. the lou going to. the whatever famous landmark that you feel. like you have to. see when you're in a certain place. allow chilling forign that's the advice okay allow chilling. foreign so yeah but i do agree. with that and because i said it. well you said it and i said it. and then you agreed to. it and i agree with you which in essence. i'm agreeing with myself. which is okay to. agree with yourself i think it's actually really healthy and so um don't you know new orleans. honestly is just don't be dumb. like don't go out alone. at night in places. you ar completely unfamiliar with just it's not the best. idea in any city. but new orleans is like particularly. wild you never know what's going. to happen out there. yeah okay when you when when do you long time. ago i was there. driving through uh no i drove from dude. i drove from la to. new orleans when i was with the um with dior right. uh she was in a movie. out there oh got it. i was at i was in new orleans. when i was like 21. one or two drove. through uh i went to. a strip club because i was like just walking i was alone. you drove there to. go to the strip club. no no no yeah yeah and i was like i guess. i'll go in here you know. per um and i w and i went in d to. say i guess i'll go in here about a strip. club is amazing by the way yeah. it's because every other place. is a strip club i was going. yeah and so yeah i didn't even. wasn't even like i want to. i wanted to go. but it wasn't like let's go. to the strip club sure. yeah so i walked in and this really hot. stripper was like

hotel and i just kind of went. went to bed you know okay. that's not the ending i. wanted but okay yeah i know. but then and then i'm like and i didn't do it. because i was like oh i shouldn't pay. for sex and then i was like that's not really. what it was no it wasn't it. wasn't i mean i guess. technically she was like i want to. leave it sounds like to. me she's like i want to. leave work and i can't leave work without making any that's how she put it oh right. okay so yeah so know she probably takes money. for sex but i that's how she put it and then i was like why. did i do that why. did you not do that. yeah that be like that's like for a 21yearold to. do some go be going. to new orleans it's hilarious. yeah i just didn't do. it doing now opportunities missed. opportunities you know yeah. anyway didn't do it and you know things worked out. and she she could be still there. she could be dead she's still working. there yeah she could be you know. having her own family dude i when i drove to. new orleans different different genre. of story i got pulled over. by a cop in a different. part of louisiana bo and. i swear to. god swear to. god he came to. my window i rolled down the window. i was so scared totally. desolate alone i don't know i've seen. too many movies you know. and i got way more scared. when the first thing he did he said hey california. boy and i was like oh god. oh this is the beginning. or like the first hor movie [ __ ] but it was fine. hey california boy it was. fine why don't you step. out the vehicle that's exactly. what i envisioned yeah and then what happened. he just gave me a ticket. he was he was not so both. of us he was not a killer. bad endings to. this new orleans story yeah well for me. it was good he didn't do. anything that bad he just gave. me a but the story the bad. story is bad story is terrible. yeah but california b's pretty. good yeah but then it ends. i'm saying so trying to. pull me down to. your level i'm just saying i walked in with the strip. club cool story and then bad and fizzled. out so we both didn't have an orgasm. needs company we both. didn't i did with the cop. it's different kind of thing. hey cforia by oh god officer. what seems to be. the i'm busting i'm. sorry dude the sound you make is like in a movie. when someone's turning into. someone else you know like like an inner space that. is what's happening when you're busting. okay well busting makes me. feel good what's that. from you what literally last episode. did i ghostbusters yes okay. goldfish the way you remember. stuff well i don't have a good. memory i want to. give this girl a couple of suggestions for new. orleans you like it like it since you guys told her basically just to. be careful and that's it. well it's good advice isn't it. no i no we didn't just say. be careful i said chill. dude he said chill. operation chill but yeah go specific he's got probably got [ __ ] he's got to. do and well go ahead. he's been he's been there. re more recently than us. okay two things one is go. to the world war ii. museum it's amazing chris would never go it's would why would you go to. the world war i museum. in in because it's there. and it's a good one. he's saying it's the really it's the biggest i think it's the biggest one in america. and it's incredible really. yeah ni all right why. is it there it's got to. be somewhere it does got to. be somewhere but germany no. but for american you don't only have them. in germany it's not like world. the only place that world war. ii affected was germany no. it was pretty affected in germany. it was go on and then the other thing. she should do is go get a muffaletta. from the original muffaletta place. which is making it up. i think it's called central. grocery or something. made it up central. grocery central market. or something fizzled out muetta. yeah it's a sandwich. you know what a muffet is no. okay what is it's it's like an italian. sandwich on aa hey i love that. [ __ ] man i tell you right now a th and sandwich a fuka muffaletta forget it fota about it i i never i never knew about a muffaletta fota about it okay that i didn't like i don't care those are two wholesome. things you can go do. alone and have fun and they both end. with not busting no. bu makes me feel good. those were two good pieces. of advice yes i know what that's from. okay um just do another one. wow hey mad chris what's going. on uh my name is josiah. i'm calling from tennessee. uh want to. get your thoughts on a pretty tricky. situation that i'm in right. now cool um my wife. and i we moved out to. nashville a couple of years. back from houston texas um all of my family. is still back in texas. uh but we moved out here. found jobs settle down and we really enjoy. the place um but we're actually going to. be welcoming our first baby. into the the world uh in september. so super excited about that. can't wait to. be a dad um but where my uh complicated. situation comes in is my brother. uh back in texas uh him. and his fiance are planning. for their wedding and surprise surprise. they are planning to. get married right around the same. time that my baby is due. well they're bad people um chris you've got two of your own. so you know exactly what my situation. is like uh it's not easy. to plan around when a baby. is do especially when there's travel involved. um so she probably can't travel just a bit of a tricky. situation all around um so where my question. comes in um am i a bad. brother and do i have a place. to speak uh to. ask my brother to. consider uh possibly moving. it around and considering other dates um i would love to. be there for him uh like he was in my wedding. yeah um but it's just very tricky. to try to. be in multiple places all at once. whenever there's uh all this going. on kind tricky um or do i just need to. kind of come to. terms with the idea that i may not be. able to be in my brother's wedding. and i might have to. stay take care of my wife. and our baby that's on. the way yeah um i think my brother. is kind of open. to the idea of tossing around. other dates and maybe considering u. moving things around but just at the same. time really trying to. stick to uh that time. frame um so would love to. hear what you guys have to. say uh it's really tricky. and i would love to. know what you guys would do. in this situation um again. really appreciate you guys take it. easy okay you too man. that was too long. i that was that was crazy. too long and he said the same. thing a bunch of times the way. he said the same. thing but slightly different is impressive. almost it is it seems like a very good. guy oh yeah i'm not saying you know but of course so separate. issues so um it's very simple. but go ahead yeah it's very simple. because it doesn't sound. like has a date nailed down. yet you literally canot they airlines. will not let you fly if you're what. seven months doct won't let no but they won't let you on. the plane if you look really really pregnant. like obviously later in your third. yeah yeah because it's [ __ ] liability it's not good there's a reason doctors say not to. you know oh well yeah and and airlines. know and it's not in their uh interest. to let people fly if they're really but it is when it comes to. the you know what i mean. it is when it com. it is when it comes. to the pocketbook but yeah that's true. um yeah no it sounds. like also they didn't nail. down a date yet. the wedding yeah oh i oh i didn't i didn't well he was like my brother's open. possibly or should i ask. to consider he's he he said sound. that's tough to. move it is tough but it. is april you know so yeah to. september right i mean look stuff. happens it all depends you know. if if you were going to. have a baby at my wedding. and i i would understand i would be like yeah don't do it. or i'd be like uh it's it's the brother's day. you would totally understand. oh yeah i mean like who any any good. brother would you can't expect an expect like an a very very close. to giving birth mother. travel to your wedding. but like you're that that so close. to my face his question. is is he a bad guy. and he's not a bad guy. all no for even bringing it. up is not a bad guy. for thinking about is not a bad guy. you're honestly a bad guy. for the mustache and yeah and for taking really really long. with yeah you take too long. and so no i i don't think all. jokes aside i don't think uh that. it um i don't think that you're a bad. guy and i think that that you you. you have to. bring that up because you can't. you can't go i mean. your wife definitely can't. go you you can't leave her exactly. ex so it's all like huh. wow the worst solu the worst. uh summarization of all sometimes. you just got to. be like it's all like huh. yeah but here's the thing. though i would go so far. as to say the only potentially bad. person in all of this. is if your brother doesn't understand. when you tell him this. otherwise everyone is a good person. yeah your brother's may be a little absent. minded for not thinking about this. but like who knows unless unless they booked. the date and then they got pregnant. that could totally totally possible. yeah in which case. it's honestly the baby's fault. is it's definitely ground him. when it comes definitely definitely oh it's a boy. you're grounded your sperm's fault. yeah spm fault dick's fault. it's your wiener's fault yep. it's your balls' fault honestly. yeah foring it p pull down your own. pants and smack your penis. yep abuse it okay. well it failed you. you' fail kinky kinky abuse it. dude i was thinking about people who actually have the kink. of getting kicked in the balls ah you think about kinks. too much but on no. it's so funny dude. kinks are hilarious to. me i know that are they hilarious. to you depends on the kink. some of them are quite. upsetting i think and unfortunate i should say actually i think they're hilarious. just across the board whale. do you know why i think i can glean. why but yeah why it's from something. that happened so long ago. this is the thing i obviously i understand. and agree with that but isn't it. possible that some brains are just wacky as hell. yes but it started. from something it's not just you think. in every single case. of every kink it. is some every single time. something that happened to. a young person's mind every single time. that put him on a path. him or her on a path. to developing this strange. thing that is so every single time. wild how fragile young. minds are it's crazy. my son thinks he you know can't go to. sleep because he has a hand nail. my son thinks that what can't. go to sleep. because he has a hangnail. my son thinks you know. have a hangnail kink. oh yeah 35y old the absolute. worst kink you know. um no but i'm just saying it's like they're so funny. to me kinks are hilarious. cuz you're beholden to. them you know like no matter what. it's like fall either well that yeah. um but so uh the thing that gets sad. about kings to. me is that people with weird. ones end up feeling such shame. yeah it's terrible i read. this book called the other side. of desire and it's like four. different sections about people with really really weird. really kinks i mean you would love it. i mean how have you not recommended that. book i well you don't read. so well but i you would read listen. to the audio book i would you know. what i would do i would read that. and i would i probably have friends. with those people because i love weirdos. there was one one was obviously it. was like a foot guy. but then there was really weird. stuff with like like uh what's the thing. when you want to. have sex with dead people necrofilia i mean i mean i don't know ding. ding ding you know yeah. one was that it's a weird. it's yeah and it deals. with like how bad they feel. about it yeah sucks. dude it's whatever it is that. gets you going it wasn't up. to you it's not your decision. so you don't have to. feel bad about it um you didn't make your brain. you don't even create your own. thoughts let alone the things that you feel i know i know but um actions. matter but thoughts no an old japanese. man [music] i was thinking about uh getting kicked into. the balls though uh oh yeah and some people like that's their kink. to get just booted in the nuts. uhhuh what i'm just laughing. at the he's gna our producer. has been about to. sneeze for so long and he's fighting. it for so long. the battle was intense. dude okay yeah sorry to. get kicked in the booted in the nuts. right cu are k. hard they go oh yes you know what i mean. like dude yeah i i knew a dominatrix that told me. about all the kinds of she said the most common. one get this dude. not only is it that. but they don't even want. to get off yeah that's odd. they just want to. get kicked in the nuts over. and over i believe it. stepped on like they lay on. the ground and she would stand. on top of them. and just like bear down with all. her weight it's just that dude. she said most of them. were really really um rich. finance you he right. like that's like that's what she's directly told me. like that she said it's never someone. so it's got to. be like i'm so powerful. but what i need to. feel also that opposite side. of that's one i don't know cu. it involves pain pain. to me i'm out and for that. reason i'm out anytime pain's involved. the slightest bit i'm like no. no we're done right. we done same don't want. it i don't that connection. i know it's exists for a lot. of people does not exist. for me i do not connect. pain with sex in any way. really weird huh but a lot. of people do man. a lot of people do dude. it hurts so bad to. get kicked in nuts yeah. i know it really does. it really does and women. kind of and i understand. why they kind of are like they don't like make fun. of it but it's like oh oh how bad could it really. hurt you just don't know well don't know how bad really does. hurt it's it's indescribable kristen thought that when she was younger. guys pre it was a whole conspiracy. that guys pretended like it hurt. that much to get sympathy. there you go understand. no no and i was like she's like and even now she's like did. it really hurt. that bad i was like see. you can't it's cuz they can't. they can't it's not. possible it it it it it's it's like men with childbirth. there's no chance we could. ever fathom or even. approximate obviously they're not similar. pain big dumps okay. man you know just utterly. disgusting you know in the context. of the conversation we're having utterly. disgusting you but i'm just saying i take. s if i take selum husk forget. it okay i'm going to. forget it right now i hope but don't i really hope i'm just saying if i'm eating and i take [ __ ] husk and i take my protein. stuff could be good could be bad. daero could be good could. be bad um all right. should another one anyway yeah hey chris and mat. a big fan of the show. my name's christian i'm from utah. um but my question has to. do with uh something that came up. on the podcast and you guys. both said that you are or you guys. have been told that you're unapproachable um and i get that. all the time really he looks so nice. i don't want to. be unapproachable um so my question. is how do i be more approachable. i guess is it just my face. am i am i screwed like it's not. your face i can't change my face. but um yeah let me know what you guys. do if you guys have any solutions. i mean he could take his chain. out the chain doesn't help. it's do i think it's the chain. and the hat it makes it might make people think you're like a tough guy. or something like that particularly. a black hat you're saying is prett. yeah i mean if the hat was orange. it wouldn't be so bad. maybe you know but the chain. also i want to. go on record okay whatever. that style of chain is. now i don't what do. you mean by that the the three. links and then the long link. you see okay i don't mean. gold yeah okay that's why i asked no. yeah that style is a is a specific particular. style that that i see to. me it's the worst chain. around and i don't want him. to feel bad and i'll tell you why. i should hope not yeah. because i had that chain. so i don't want him to. like oh i'm better. than i'm not i was something. about that you remember. there's something about that. chain that really so what turn the ti. what what made you turn against dude. maybe it's because i used to. have it and it's so it feels. like it's so 90s. to me oh damn. i don't think that but i get it's not 9. it was 90s for me. i'm looking at it now. yeah it bothers me. dude get the cuban links. what is that get the rope. you know what i mean. like well diamonds you know. but just wow dude wow i didn't mean. to do it well that's why. it was even funnier. i didn't mean to. do it like that wow but i did. it to him. he's got a great. mustache he's got so much hair per capita. under his nose he has a legit. he has legitimately great facial hair. i i i i want to. note that what did he ask. he's got beautiful eyes. you know you don't know what he asked. i forget dude you are a [ __ ] goldfish i'll remember hold on. let me try to. remember okay all right with me. um well that's going to. be boring as [ __ ] oh he's unapproachable yeah yeah yeah see yeah he's got great. eyes great facial hair i think it. is the chain in the hat. dude yeah i don't yeah you're smiling. bro i mean maybe because he's he gonna be on a podcast. maybe he's really buff. and stocky if he's really buff. and stocky i get it what if he like just because it's kind of pushed. in like what if he had like a concealed carry. like two huge guns on. his side you know and it's like i think it's the guns. and and and the shirt said [ __ ] you [ __ ] you don't approach me yeah approach me and get shot and also had no pants. on and his dick. was out i don't get it. uh yeah i don't yeah mix it. mix that up see if that. changes it it is oh oh you know. what here's another thing. that you got to. consider here's another thing. that he should consider this. makes all the sense in the world. dude but he's he's in utah. and you're saying looking like that. and utah even more well. i'm just saying in new york. yeah this guy's like it would be like approaching. a baby you're like oh oh this. guy i'll ask this. guy for directions in utah. he you know he's got the chain. and the black hat is in n. dell could be yeah definitely definitely could be that. yeah his name is christian. and he's in utah. so go somewhere else is the is the solution. oh very good yeah. if you move move honestly. anywhere f right i you can't even buy booze. on sunday there move. almost anywhere or try maybe try one by one. first the change for a few days. see what happens then the hat. for a few days see what happens. then if nothing changes try both. just like i got to. move yeah exactly yeah could be that. but try so it doesn't cost. as much money try. the chain in the hat. first uhuh don't uproot your whole. life go to. georgia right and then it turns. out to be the chain. in the hat you'd be [ __ ] yeah okay all right okay next one yeah hey guys it's sweet asking for some advice about a friend of mine uh i got this buddy who keeps getting. in shortterm relationships but. with really real nice girls. like good girlfriend material um but whenever he's in the relationship. he's so not into. it like he's whiny and complaining and he's like yeah she's great. but blah blah blah blah. blah ls all the negative. things about her and so when he inevitably decides to. end the relationship then he immediately. is like and he realiz. all the things that are now. g to him. like what he's thrown away. i'm like it's okay it's okay. you know it's still this. time but maybe learn something. from this experience and then next time. it won't be w i like this. guy so much he's great. can have a happy relationship. but now for like the fifth. time in a couple of years. this cycle has repeated and he's calling me to. be [music] [applause] like so sad. let me tell why did i break. up with her she was so la. la la i never find anyone. like her and the thing is they all. really great girls like it's not. that he romanticizes everything. afterwards it's more like he doesn't see what he has with his present. so yeah we get it. is there anything i can tell him. to help him be less or is it. just judge to. be okay heard his voice. so bad guys okay thank you. thank you man this. is great look at this. wow look where you are also. that's a full lip right. there man i mean. just our friend [ __ ] taunting i think we said we had i think we said he had no lips maybe oh i did yeah sorry man i love you he does have lips though no i know he showed me and now i i take i walk back what i said about dude. okay that's great i do you know. what i do jokes. like this like where i do the thing. where i'll do like the song. and did the thing you know. so do you yeah right. right yeah the guy helped me. realize something before we even. get into this oh okay. when he first did it. i go what's he doing. sure i know he's doing the thing. i appreciate appreci it but i'm like i hope. it doesn't do it again. oh really okay did it. a second time and i go it's funny. he did it twice. oh did it a third. time laughed oh okay. so when kristen rolls her. eyes about me doing this. stuff uhhuh i got to. realize she doesn't get it. and it's just funny and i'm going. to keep doing it. yeah so thank you for realizing. that and i was going. to do that anyway but thank you for the confidence. to understand that i can keep doing. that right mh i mean. so insecure speaking of confidence. i mean yeah right. i don't know what you got. till it's gone don't know. what you got till it's gone. what do you think i said. on is what you said. no no no no you said it. i i i know it's not the song's not about fighting. don't know what you got till it's on. dude um yeah wait what what i'm you. now what what would you even. ask oh i i get it. how what do you say. to a guy okay. you know and cated. i i i i just i think have i done. that specific one with the with that song. the janice was it janice choplin. who sings that [ __ ] jonny. mitchell right whatever it doesn't matter. um uh uh i i i that guy. [ __ ] him [ __ ] him he's hopeless well i mean that is so hardcore like what are you going. to do maybe you can tell them. like give these things a little bit more. time don't nix them after a couple. months like let it breathe. don't be so eddie murphy and boomerang about it. be more like open to. it actually working out because hey if you have any kind of memory you'll remember that this happens. to you a lot you don't give them. a chance remember exactly. yeah i mean just try. to make him remember you know. it's it's sometimes dude sometimes people need to. remember something so bad that their brain. figures out a way to. make sure they don't right. okay so preach dude. so what ends up. be i should start saying that. a lot sort of being a work. around that is to. like have physical and this would be you suggesting. it to your friend. have like physical reminders in his space. in his home whoops and like so that. he is there's something in the external world. that is forcing him to. remember this thing scientist. so at first it can be like get your friend. a lava lamp nobody likes lava. lamps no nobody likes lava. lamps get him a lava. lamp stick him stick it. front and center in a room. he's always in in his house. you know and then every time. he sees it he won't think oh [ __ ] this lava lamp i hate lava. lamps he'll think oh i do that. [ __ ] thing i got to. remember i'd do that thing. so then it'll he'll internalize it. then he can get rid of the lava. lamp and now he's it's it's now. have a deal with laval lamps dude. and go to. laval lamps dot com put in the code. mata dude la there are people. that love lav lamps dude. that's crazy it's crazy. but but think about it. they're kind of cool they are. yeah i mean that's why. kids are like i'm going. to get one for calvin. dude he would like that. yeah what the [ __ ] how have i never thought sharper image i used to. love sharper image go to. there in the mall look at the lava. lamps yeah hey dude let's all get la dude. let's all get lava lamps. wait hold on okay why have we never had a lava lamp. we wanted one our parents. wouldn't let us get one. or what oh no i don't remember. that oh i was like come. can we get one. maybe you weren't good you. weren't a good enough. boy maybe i think i think what it. was is our parents [ __ ] hated them. they're ugly i get it. not they don't go with anything. they don't go with anything. that's what it is dude. and so if you're mom who is an actual interior. decorator and an insane person she's not going to. put a lava lamp in a room. that like goes really well together. with her aesthetic well maybe if she let me get a lava. lamp i would have come over more. now as an adult. but now go and she don't know no. i don't think she wants you. over more we were over plenty. hurt me hurt me i'm over. l she lik i try to. go over there as much. as i can but i'm always on the road. it's i want to. go over more i go over. there a lot i think rubbing. it in make me feel bad. i go over there a lot. and i really enjoy myself. and they really enjoy having me they've never once. mentioned gosh i wish chris. was here more so i think you're good. hurt me but also would hurt. me if you did if they did say that. too isn't that interesting. it would hurt you yeah. because i would feel bad about not being there. that interesting but wait no the point. is to make you not. feel bad so they don't miss you. they don't need you there. they really want you there. hurt me they both hurt. me i'm i'm kidding and you oh you are. okay okay you what no. i know i just didn't know if you didn't how could you not. know that i know you would know. that i didn't know if you were understanding. what i was saying uh yes got out. of that no i don't understand. i'm sorry what did you mean. you didn't know if i understood what i thought maybe what i was saying. was not computing with you and you believed something. that was not what i was. saying but i know that. if you knew what i was saying what you were. saying was a joke. getting so damn close to. me uh you get it. yeah i think so yes got out of that. one i'm not sure i get it. but yeah oh so then don't make me go. yes got out of that. one i didn't make you do that. man i didn't ask you. to say yes got out of that. one i said yes and then you very quickly. said that and then i was going. to continue and say i think so i thought that yes i'm listening. you might have misunderstood what i was saying. get you get it which thing. though whatever it is okay. at this point i don't even remember okay. wow but what you said to. what maybe i thought you thought i meant. whoa get it yeah was real uh because maybe you didn't know. what i meant get it. okay okay okay therefore i wouldn't know. it was a joke. get it yeah you're getting. so close to. me this episode you get it. okay now now now had i known you. knew what i said yeah. i would have known it. was a joke do you get it. yes okay yes got out of that. one wow dude dude that's great. it's satisfying yeah isn't it satisfying to. figure [ __ ] that out yeah it's it's it's honestly so good that's how i felt you were texting me about something the other night you remember oh what was it it was about uh their house like something about their house. in linat when when we go to. leave when we go to. leave their house i don't remember but it was something about me. being there on sunday. it was about being at their house. anyway and by the time we figured it out. at the end i was like oh isn't it. so good that we figured it out. i don't remember was that. part of it what a surprise was that. part it was just me and you texting. oh side side side. texting or with the side. no just me and you only me and you we could go back. and look yeah we could okay. is it something we don't want to. share though yeah i knew it. yeah of course you did. cuz i wasn't being specific yeah yeah but but because you remembered. yeah i remember but i don't yeah. correct but i i i could tell by. the look on your face. because we're brothers that it. was something that you didn't. want to bring up. you think that was based on. the look on my face but not the fact. that it wasn't being specific. now he's thinking i thought that. from jump you didn't want. to bring it up. because of the look on your

know what i thought. that he didn't i thought i thought he didn't i i really liked logan. hughes and i thought he he was friends. with me we were friends. when i first moved there. this is going to. end in tears by the way. the way chris is acting right. now it's going to. be so sad. and then high school. happened and then we kind of fell. out a little bit and then i saw him. later on in like sophomore or junior. year and i was like oh yeah why am i not friends. i w't be friends with him more and he just wasn't really feeling it. man sometimes people aren't feeling. it that much dude. and you know what dude. what i started following on instagram. uhhuh you know what i meant. to say right. i started following him on instagram. yeah yeah i [ __ ] it up a little bit oh and he wasn't following. me sad so i'm like that's okay. of course it's okay we don't you. can't be the kind of person. that gets mad to. i don't i'm not and i'm not yeah. so and and also if i'm following you and you're not following me. i don't care of course. why would you care i i do. not care yeah okay. but in my head i'm like it's weird. that we were friends i'm still carrying this. over do you know what i'm saying. yeah you still got issues. like i'm like and it's because it was him. it wasn't because i'm like i'm i'm i'm we were friends. yeah i got that part. and now i'm like now i'm a famous. comedian okay so and i don't mean. to brag but i am. though okay yeah okay and and i'm like he knows i'm a famous. comedian like there's no way. i'm not saying everybody does. i'm not saying everybody knows who i am that. is not what i'm saying. what i'm saying is an eighth. grade friend who then ends. up having a famous comedian you went. to high school. with him yeah yeah i mean somebody in high scho somebody. high school told him at the very least. so at that point i'm like why wouldn't he be following me yeah. well yeah okay we're thinking about i'm not insecure. about but we're thinking about it. okay but then i'm like he must hate. me he must not like you yeah. he must like what i would. think yeah coupled with the high school. thing history yeah so you dm'd. him why don't you like me. no i follow him yeah. and then i think he starts. following me oh so i'm like okay. yeah but is he just doing it. because i did it. he knows you're looking now and yes. yeah yeah yeah interesting dilemma. right now he writes me one day. oh i hate you he says no. and i've hated you since. 8th grade responds to. something i did oh okay. on stories cool a short. thing okay haha something uh not enough. okay yeah but like a word. or two yeah okay i right. back yeah buddy y y y you. know what i mean okay. nothing he sees it. and then that's it yeah what that's not. anything that's normal say something. else dude you have such a crush on. this i know but it's fine. since you were 13. but let me tell you why. it's fine oh it's fine. because dude actually he is good looking you know. but and
