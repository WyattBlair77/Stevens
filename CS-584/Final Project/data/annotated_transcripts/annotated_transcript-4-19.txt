[ __ ] aaron eckhart i must have saw aaron heckhart at one of those [ __ ] things where he's trying to. get to the center. of the earth what's that. movie called the core bad movie. um and you know it's a bad movie. because aaron eckhart's the lead. if in heck is the lead it's a bad. movie sorry said it but we tell the truth. here okay i'm the truth. i speak the truth dude. if aaron eckhart is the lead. in it terrible movie if aaron eckhart is the second. lead in him great [ __ ] movie sully it's a great movie tom hanks is the lead aaron eckhart is the second lead great. [ __ ] movie erin brockovich great. [ __ ] movie julia roberts. is the lead [ __ ] airnet card is the second one if you want a movie to. bang and ride like a roller. coaster put aaron eckhart in it. only build second if you put him in the lead. battlefield los angeles the core. [ __ ] other movies that i don't know. and the reason why i don't know them. is because they weren't hits. and that's my point all. right box office. disaster aaron eckhart at number one. box office disaster aaron eckhart at number. two critical acclaimed winning oscars. not him though but the movie okay. now i'm in the core. i passed aaron eckhart i'm so low. i'm dreaming right i got a shovel. i'm trying to get further. i don't know what it is. about that after 8 a.m sleepings that. just puts me the [ __ ] out like i was drugged and i thought it was when i went to. zanny island but it's not. i don't go to. zany island i haven't been a [ __ ] zany island in about a month or month and a half. and i slept after 8 p.m and i killed it. dude i had weird dreams. dreams of exes in my past. having meetings with them for some [ __ ] reason serious. meetings where we were talking. about real world issues. and then i had another dream that thought you know. it was like nothing but it was like i was in an auditorium and people were playing baseball. people don't play baseball in auditoriums okay but it didn't seem weird. that it was a dream. it just seemed like it. was the thing to. do now in this world. we were below the earth's core. of dreamland okay that's where we were. and we were listening in that. song car wash that's what it. is i learned that since last week. i haven't get rid of told me. that it's the beginning of the song. car wash and you never really. know what baseball games because they don't really. [ __ ] start the part where it's like we're at the camash they just get to. the bar boom and then they go and now batting jeff. kent hensley mulins john allrude david cohen fred. mcgriff ken kamenetti wade boggs kevin ellster howard johnson don mattingly dwight. goodin dave parker jose conseco barry. bonds mark maguire bobby bonilla. andy that's it that's it. that's all i had i got more but that's all i could. do with the [ __ ] with the you know what i mean and uh they don't play none of them. play anymore bobby bonilla still gets paid. because he made a [ __ ] great contract. when he was back in the mets in like 1990. or whatever but anyway dude. um so i'm doing that and everyone chants. [music] and as it went. everyone would go rob he has bad clothes. don't know why dreams. are [ __ ] weird and that's all i want to. say about it [music]. who's rob whoops forgot we. left it in there twice who the [ __ ] is rob dude. who's rob i dreamt it they say. dreams don't last longer. than three minutes i'm skeptical. on that i'm skeptical on that. because we seem like we were chanting. that rob he has bad clothes. [laughter] a long time. in that auditorium dude to. the beginning of carl rob he has bad clothes. that's what we were chanting. and i don't know who rob is. but it's you know it's all good. dude and sometimes you just dream. [ __ ] sometimes you dream you have really great. meetings with your ex's that. are therapeutic and you're trying. to solve world issues. and emotional [ __ ] and sometimes you just dream about a fictitious guy named rod rob and how he has bad clothes. in an auditorium where you're playing. baseball and that's it and that's all i want to. say doesn't really seem like there's any like dreams. in the middle there where it kind of makes sense. but not really it seems like it's either. [ __ ] makes so much sense. or zero sense right. um wow so robbie has bad clothes. and um and that's honestly. that that's all that's honestly. all i want to. talk about but i went down. to [ __ ] the earth core of dreamland. man i really really did. i really did um speaking. of the [ __ ] the the absolute cool. superhero hair i got dude. yay they did it. yeah yeah they did it. yeah yeah they did it. they made [ __ ] superman gay yeah that means yeah they probably did the midsummer night but it's not clark kent so does it count no it doesn't does it everyone's like yeah for representation. yeah funny representations make clark gay. who's [ __ ] john kent dude. the [ __ ] is john kent. john kent coming in all like you. know saving the day but not really saving the day. thinking he's saving the day. but not really saving. the day dude right in my head. dude clark's in the closet. period i don't give a [ __ ] i know he loves lois lane i know he you know he i know he's a power [ __ ] right because he's superman but john kent and he's you know and he's gay and people think it's amazing and that's like why are you ruining superman they're not they're not dude they're not ruining superman it's all [ __ ] fictitious all of it people say this is what the liberals want who gives a [ __ ] let him have it you know i get it how people are like how are my kids supposed to. read this i don't know man. you figure that out i don't care. so much you know when i first see a [ __ ] article like that. i got it i gotta i gotta admit. i i go like this. what the [ __ ] what a weird world who cares this. much but then i get okay people do care this much so fine dude i don't give a [ __ ] honestly i think every single character. ever should be gay. i think everyone should be gay. i don't just think john can and i don't think. i think clark kent should be gay. i don't know who the [ __ ] john ken is by the way. i don't know who it. is they tried to. marry both sides and they were like oh let's put you know. maybe he's another kent but also he's he's gay. but it's not clark kent because so they can still have. their clark kent right the toxic. boys could have the clark kent. but then also the gay. boys they can have the [ __ ] the what crowd they could have john it's so funny too it's like such a [ __ ] it's like the the offbrand [ __ ] right like clark kent is still gonna be having sex with lois but it's like it's like when you go in a [ __ ] um like there's vons out here on the west coast and everyone goes to. vaughn's and then the people who can't afford it. they go to a place. called john's with the same. font it's real dude. people in la know what i'm talking. about but it's real in the worst. parts of town there's john's rhymes. with vaughn's try a little harder. maybe it's [ __ ] john kent uh john john kent maybe maybe john kents maybe john maybe that's what john's. is he's the offbrand version of vons and he's also. the offbrand version of superman. and he's got i haven't seen the comics. here maybe he runs a [ __ ] a popular food. chain a popular grocery. store chain in the you know. in the inner cities i don't know. i don't know but i do. know if he's doing that he's also stroking dudes. off and kissing him and [ __ ] because he's gay and that's fine. dude and that's fine. we have nothing against john. kent i want to. meet him but i just think make all of the characters gay everyone's gay period. also in tv not just comics. everyone should also have gay relationships. in like i'm talking about lauren order. that guy chris maloney should come in and be like hey what's up. whoa nice you want to. go out for a coffee. partner and then bust some cases and then come back home. to that dude and just kind of cuddle. him you know it's over. the pants [ __ ] because we're also on whatever it's on nbc but dude chris maloney make him gay [ __ ] put purple hair on him make him gay as [ __ ] at night right that's it whatever the [ __ ] thing is like uh you know happy days fonzie there's also gonzi and he's gay as [ __ ] and he's got a purple leather jacket dude right why not every why not who gives a [ __ ] i don't give a [ __ ] who do you care oh how am i supposed to. have my kids read. this [ __ ] bro you'll figure it out you had the kids make your own comic books. draw pictures for your kids. if you're so antigay go ahead do that yeah and he's got a [ __ ] and he's straight as [ __ ] dude this guy's a fireman and he has sex with so many women's man [ __ ] that he's not gay at all read. that son [ __ ] john kent or just make your own super villain. and make him try to. kill john kent how about that if you don't like john ken. enough go learn art airbrush it. all together and make a [ __ ] villain john kent who are you i'm the john kent annihilator you could make that character. it won't be in their comics. but it could be in yours. i guarantee you'd have a [ __ ] dude and you know people are talking oh you know crystalia he got [ __ ] red pilled you know oh you're still a liberal. cuck but even though. you know we had your back. and you or or some people. you got red pill. [ __ ] this blue pill red. pill [ __ ] [ __ ] it all dude i don't do pills. unless it's zany island dude. i'm not red pill blue pill. man [ __ ] all this everything in the world is so divisive relax i'm talking about the purple pill how about that take the red pill. little bit of the blue. pill put it in together. and make a nice purple. drink out of it how about that. drink a purple drink john kent. he's around gay superman. cool as [ __ ] that's it you know everyone's so divisive. about everything and it's like i'm pissed. off because [ __ ] it's like what can when can we be pissed off about the real [ __ ] bluetooth isn't ready. for cars yet it's not ready. for cars yet every car i ever. go in i link my bluetooth to. the car i [ __ ] i try. to do a voice note. hey i'll be right. there playback i'll be right. there no i said hey i'll you gotta wait. four seconds to. do the voice note for the [ __ ] bluetooth shits. make bluetooth start recording on the car. immediately enough for this [ __ ] oh look it's sarah hey what's up how's it. going hello hello hello and then sarah hey hello. are you do i ha. do you have can i hear can you hear me. yeah what what what's going. on sorry it's [ __ ] audi it's actually audi.

doesn't work does [ __ ] [ __ ] ass npr voices the reason. why bluetooth doesn't work with cars. is because they might sync them. and back in the air conditioning. when it came out and people would flock. to the movie theaters. because it was less. expensive not necessarily because they liked the movie. but it was cheaper. than keeping their house cool. they always got that fake [ __ ] ass

the movie made eight three. billions and billions of dollars. venom two came out and it. made billions upon billions of dollars. if you were to. zoom in and see billions. and billions of the very dollars. that you spent to. go see the movie um so yeah. if anybody saw that that movie venom honestly. go [ __ ] yourself um you know it's i realize that they're just [ __ ] these movies these marvel movies they're for kids dude adults are like they're for kids and guys who push up their glasses that say well actually you know i just wanted to. you know i know it's funny. but that's what they say. that's what they lead stuff. with no you know yeah. sure i understand why you're laughing. but actually the point of it. is that's what those guys. say right they walk out. of [ __ ] nine times out of ten you walk out of a if you just stand outside of a star wars or a marvel movie or some [ __ ] like that you get you get nine people out of ten people opening day you know it trails off a little later but opening day the guys that are walking out are saying a version of this no and i know it was funny but actually the point of it was that's what they're saying if you listen close enough okay it just makes me laugh that people get all bent. out of shape when in that when actual when in actuality that was his essence. from the from from issue. number 46 when he first. popped on the theme. in thor um so yeah. dude it's just you know. they're they're for kids dude. right um a guy came up. to me the other day. uh in uh i was at coffee. bean you know doing what i do. just relax and having my eyes. to americano [ __ ] some people think it goes against relaxing because i'm caffeinating myself but that's how i get to. base levels so where i can just chill all right. now i got the [ __ ] nice americano. i get it dry cloudy. she [ __ ] serves me up nice. and as a matter of fact. she said can you shout me. out on your podcast. and i said sure claudia and i forgot for about two months. until now so hi claudia she's a beautiful. lady and she's so nice and she gives me. my coffee the way. i get it i show. up and i say hey can i have it. and she says you want your dry. ice americano and i go like this. yup also known as four. shots over ice and we have a laugh. dude cloudy and i we laugh. right and so i get it. and she says here you go. and i'm like wow that was quick. and she's like i know what you want. dude she's great look we have a good. time okay four shots over. ice i'm drinking it i'm sitting there. i just sit down for a little bit. i want to. get back home and play with my son. i'm hanging out though i'm having a good. time checking my phone all of a sudden. two hasidic jews walk up. to me now i think here we go. right who knows who knows all i know. is i don't deal with hasidic. jews a lot that's it. so this is gonna go a certain way. and i have no idea what's going. to happen i welcome. the i welcome it i welcome. it they walk up to. me two of them. and they say hey and i say hey now i'm always skeptical when somebody comes up. to me okay you have to. understand a lot of people know who i am. a lot of people like me. a lot of people don't like me. a lot of people just want to. annoy me a lot of people don't know they're being annoying. a lot of people are very friendly. i get all sorts of the you. know i get the spectrum. back and forth right. so these two hasidic jews come up to. me and they say hey are you jewish. by any chance and it's one of those things where it's like i have to. pick the correct thing to. say next that makes this the shortest exchange possible. right but the trick. is you never know. what that is right. when people walk up to. you and they say are you a registered voter. you go uh oh are they trying. to get me to. register to vote. or do they need me. to be a registered voter. so they can bother. me longer right. okay so you're like okay. well i am registered to. vote but you're trying to. study the person like you're sherlock. like trying to [ __ ] move in on their cufflinks well they have expensive cupcakes they might be this and that maybe you don't know you just guess you fire it away. sometimes you lie you're like no i'm not a registered. voter they're like good because we're just getting. registered we're like [ __ ] i was lying. and i got you're like i was lying. right but you don't want to. do so most of the time. i just bank on the truth. okay i just go with the truth. because then this way i'm not in the wrong. and i can say not interested. took me 40 years to. realize that that's what i had. to do and that was what was best. so these two hasidic jews remember this. is where we were hey. by any chance are you jewish and i like this said no hoping for the best and they go like this all right. never mind thanks [music]. we won i don't want to. say i won against the hasidic jews that sounds very antisemitic. i want to. say i won the game. with the hasidic juice. so that's it i just don't want to. talk to anybody for too. long right uh but it was nice you. know um and i think honestly i'm gonna look into. the religion i'm gonna be hasidic well imagine if i was an acidic jew. right and i just [ __ ] started doing the podcast. and my and i just had like tendrils. and [ __ ] and big top hats i. don't really know what they wear but um anyway that's what happened. to me and uh that's it. it's you know the [ __ ] i do over. i mean dude i know this is like the reason. why you guys listen. to this podcast but man. i [ __ ] think and i analyze everything. as it is so thank god. i have a [ __ ] thing about uh thank god. i have a [ __ ] an outlet to. just talk about i can't believe hundreds of thousands. of you listen to. this [ __ ] um but it is what it is and i really appreciate you guys and i love you for it man. um but i overanalyzed [ __ ] everything. man i was watching you. know what actually you know. what dude actually i want to. get your [ __ ] take on this [ __ ] man i really do we're all friends you're listening to. me in your car your cubicle or you got me. in your [ __ ] earphones when you're working. out dude this is [ __ ] so kristin and i are in a situation where we'll get into. a discussion sometimes albeit. heated she'll say something and i'll get upset. that she said something. because i get upset. about many many things and then i'll carry. on that conversation with that hotness in my. body because of the fact that she said this. certain thing and then after the middle. of the conversation i'll go. back to that thing she said. and i'll say well it's because of how you said this. and then she'll say i didn't say. that so what happened. who's right i'll tell you who's right. someone i think it's me. here's the problem she thinks it's her. here's the problem though i'm sure it went down. the way i thought but here's the added. problem she's sure it went down. the way she thought someone's right. someone's wrong right there's that. whole thing where you'll be in couples therapy. and they'll be like well what's true. in your reality isn't necessarily what. she experienced and i'm just like but their words. and she said them and then therapists. are like but it's not about. the words and i'm just like swallowing that. because i know secretly when i get to. heaven god will be like actually. it was about the words. off to hell and um so that's been happening. it's been happening lately and i don't know. how to do it. you know we talked to. our [ __ ] therapist about it and you know we love the [ __ ] out of each other and we always come out the other end laughing and being nice to. each other but in that moment. of hotness and i'm just saying this. to you guys because i want to. share it with you because i want you to. know that you're not the only one. okay i know sometimes relationships. get tough and you guys bicker about dumb. [ __ ] but the common. ground is the love right. or the like or whatever. the [ __ ] you have you know red pill blue. pill no mix them together it's that. purple drink right so that's what you're both. trying to experience together. now we were at this. italian restaurant chain maria's kitchen. if you are a diehard fan of this. podcast you know about my history with maria's italian. kitchen i used to. get it all the time. delivered they would [ __ ] it up. 80 of the time your boy. got pissed did they always [ __ ] it up yes 80. of the time yes does that. mean always in my book. yes was it okay it was in the grand. theme scheme of things but was it. okay for my palette that. night no okay they'd either forget. the chicken or the cheese. or the linguine would be penne whatever. it was did i get pissed. yes they didn't necessarily bring me. the right pasta but boy did they bring me. annoyance all right so i'm at marie's italian. kitchen i vowed never to. go there again but then i realized i could kind of change that when it was right. in the vicinity and i could. change that too i'm never going. there again i'm never going. to order from there. again so i went and i took my son. it took calvin we took our friend it. was my our friend calvin. and kristen okay and the lady. comes to take her order. and she says hi fella. to me no kidding to. calvin and she says hi. fella how are you and calvin's. just like saying all this. [ __ ] really cute and kristen is like you know what um i'll get uh fettuccine. with pink sauce and she says sounds great. and i thought well that sounds good. pink sauce is the thing. i usually get from maria's italian. kitchen [ __ ] a decade. ago so i say you know. what i'll get linguine. with a pink sauce because i'm not really a fan. of fettuccine i love linguine. in fact it's my favorite pasta. i love the way. it holds the sauce. penne that's my brother's favorite. but honestly that's for suckers. i don't need no. [ __ ] fat pasta in my mouth. i want that long stringy. [ __ ] that lets the sauce. just [ __ ] drip down right it catches. them it plays the way. the [ __ ] sauce plays with that pasta. and how it dances. beyond your tongue it's beautiful. right the marriage of the pasta. and the sauce that's that. purple drink for me linguine. into pink sauce so she says you know what now this. is what the lady. says you know what we don't. really have linguine we have more of a spaghetti. and then fettuccine that's what she said. all right so i said oh okay. well give me the spaghetti. one then and she said great. leaves comes back with the food puts. down the fettuccine yum. pink sauce looks great. fettuccine not what i would have ordered. but i also from the looks of it. i like the way it's playing with the sauce. seems like a good marriage. to me then she drops. mine down and it's spaghetti. with pink sauce okay. now she drops it down i fuel. inside nobody sees it she walks. away nobody knows best but nobody knows so i say to. kristen well this is [ __ ] [ __ ] and she says what and i said well she brought me spaghetti and i wanted linguine she should have just told me that she didn't have linguine. and kristen says she did. and i say i had a feeling that. you were going to. say that but in so so what i did. is i cataloged the [ __ ] in my brain. when it happened and that isn't what she said. she said we don't really have linguine. we have more of a spaghetti. and then fettuccine and she said. yeah that's what that means. they don't have linguine. now i'm pissed anger it's rising okay. trying to quell it trying. to do my breathing exercises. i've learned from therapy but it's rising it's breaking. through it and i say beyond. gritted teeth to. kristen she led me. to believe there was an inbetween. noodle she led me to. believe there was an inbetween. noodle that they had hey if you don't have linguine. say one thing we don't have linguine. so then i say what do you have. you don't have more of a spaghetti. and then fettuccine you. have spaghetti and fettuccine. now i'm trying to. [ __ ] tell this to. kristin and she's like you. know what it's not always and now. it's hot because we've already had this. conversation before that's not. what she said that's not what you said. that's not what he said. that's not what they said. that's not what i said. all we have are the words. i'm gonna get up there. to st peter and he's gonna be like you know. you were wrong i don't know. what the [ __ ] dude unbelievable dude don't lead me to. believe there was an inbetween. style noodle that like hasn't even come out. yet like some new [ __ ] that like [ __ ] apple made that like it's like oh whoa there's a new one in between spaghetti and linguine yeah i want it and then it comes and it's just a [ __ ] iphone 8 again i don't [ __ ] know does update work out or not dude does bluetooth work in the car. if the [ __ ] doesn't work don't say it's gonna don't color. it a certain way so i'll be happy. because when it comes i won't be happy. dude but whatever dude. i'm working on my anger. speaking of [ __ ] i was talking i was at the coffee bean. the tea leaf dude. oh my god what a debacle you ever. have just something that happens. that's just so normal. and so boring but if you actually realize afterwards. how like do you ever. stop and think about how actual actually like stressed you are in the day. right do you ever feel. your tension i mean a lot. of you do that's why. the calm app is so [ __ ] successful they got lebron on the side. of a building just like calm with the side. of his head for some reason. it's so so side of the head. to just have a [ __ ] meditation app. you know it's so side. of the head it's less intrusive. you'd never have a [ __ ] guy just like calm and just staring you in the eyes. they took one shot of that. and they were like lebron turn your head. and he just did that and they were like calm like it. was the drake album or some [ __ ] anyway it's like rain. falling or some [ __ ] and some guy i'll tell the story way too slowly. i can't listen to. that [ __ ] when i'm going to. bed kristin tried to. do it a little bit and the guy. was telling the story so slow. i'd fall asleep in between. sentences and then he'd wake me up with a new sentence. so [ __ ] annoying dude talk faster dude. everyone does [ __ ] completely [ __ ] wrong man [laughter] you guys [ __ ] like and the clouds parted and that was and you're waking oh oh you want me to. wake up say and the clouds. parted and that was when say that. so i could fall asleep. during the day i fall asleep. over the [ __ ] color girl i'll do i'll watch drumline and fall asleep over i [ __ ] fall asleep over this calm app [ __ ] what's his name oh marion on the side of the thing drumline who was it not o marion [ __ ] the guy on america's got talent side of the face drumline nick cannon oh marion how much was his name mario but he was like i need to. make him more fancy. i got an o and an n where should i put it and then his friend. was like the ends um oh [ __ ] that's like if my name was to. crystal um so oh wow dude. so i'm losing my mind. so [laughter] to. crystal um so i'm at the so i'm i'm you ever realize how stressful the situation is i can't believe i got back. on this tangent off. of the tangent out of that. you want to. close that door but i can't believe it. so so we're watching so so we're watching just saying things. we're not watching anything so you ever. realize how stressed you are okay. and i'm walking to. the coffee bean and [ __ ] is just going it's a bonkers. nutty good day right. your [ __ ] your boy went. stupid viral earlier on in. the day right earlier. on in the day. your boy went stupid. viral he probably threw out a tick. tock that got [ __ ] one milli views a million a million a million. a million a million that's me. all day because your boy. put something on tick. tock that went dummy viral. right so i'm on [ __ ] so i'm walking into. the coffee bean with that. [ __ ] head bop i'm really i'm really i'm really i'm i'm i'm i'm i'm i'm i'm a middleaged right. my dad thinks that's a song. about emily emily emily emily and um what's that song by little perp emily um so so i do this i i walk in one door which i think that this is my problem is i walked in the door that i don't normally walk into. right i walk there's two dog. two dogs there's two doors in the coffee. bean i went into. the door that i don't normally. go into and it kind of [ __ ] my [ __ ] up so i walked and i went to. the cash register the lady. said this isn't my normal. one with claudia this isn't my normal. one right there which she knows. the ice americano dry. [ __ ] one person does in this coffee bean. but it's the person who makes the coffee. not the person at the cash register and there's always more people there so they start it but she's like what would you like so i say i would like a nice americano. dry and she says great. let me bring you up. take my wallet out go to. do it as i'm taking my wallet. out i look over to. my left side and i see a guy. walking in the door that. i just walked into. the door that i don't normally. walk into. so i see him walking in and there's a table that. i want to. sit at now i see. that table and i'm worried. that this guy is going. to take that table now. i don't know what the rules. are here right. if i'm ordering look. i was in the place. first first of all i was in the place. first so i should i guess technically have my choice. of table before the guy. that walked in but also if i walk straight to. the register and i'm ordering. a guy walks in he's not gonna [ __ ] be like hey sir you were here first which table would you like and also even thirdly it's not that big of a deal really it isn't okay it's just a preference i'd like to. sit at this table and it's between. me and the guy walking. in i made a decision. that i'm not proud of okay. i decided to i i don't like when people do this. [ __ ] but i wanted to. put whatever i had on me. on the table so he wouldn't take it. i and i'm not i'm honestly. i don't like that i did. that and i'm not gonna do it. anymore because that's [ __ ] if the guy wants the table i'm not gonna i don't want him to. see the table and be like oh good a table and then all of a sudden. i drop my hoodie on. and then he's like ah never mind. okay i don't want his disappointment. to be because of me. and that's on god so he's walking. in and i made a game time. decision right i'm not proud of but i didn't have a hoodie i just had a shirt and pants. and shoes on and i took my wallet. out and i went to. go toss my wallet on the table now. as i'm tossing my wallet on the table. i realize as it's ejecting. out of my my left hand my weak hand. all right oh it's actually too far. to throw anything indoors it the table is too far. nobody should be throwing anything this. far not just indoors but even around. people and i'm throwing something. too far indoors and practically. at a guy walking. through the door all right. so i toss it again. it's my weak hand i threw it. too high it hits. his peak and comes just rushing down faster. than gravity but rushing down hits. the table and it goes. it was like my wallet. was the size of a graduation. cap no a laser disc. no whatever's bigger than. that i'm good for two. examples that's my comedic chops. and um yeah it was like i lopped a [ __ ] laserdisc on the f. and but a big one it. goes and everyone in the coffee. shop goes like this it's just my wallet. to make matters worse. my wallet bounces and then goes off. of the table so now. loud noise basically people are. thinking but is it a ghost. because there's no evidence and then they all go. from wherever the sound was and they look back. at me and now i'm like [ __ ] because look one time when i was in a coffee shop a guy came in and he said um it was a crowded coffee. shop i was sitting there a guy walked in and he says science. is everywhere and then he turns. and walks away that guy's a crazy. person i'll never forget. it happened but that's what he said all. right he just walked in and said science. is everywhere and walked away. this is before people were really even. getting nuts right this. guy was like the the guy. had to jump on the [ __ ] nuttiness right like everybody's crazy now this was back in 2008 when people were just figuring crazy out he walked in he says science is everywhere. and honestly he's not wrong so yeah. it was a crazy. thing to do but maybe he was actually. just a chemist so he walks out. my point is that crazy. [ __ ] happened when a crazy thing. happens in a coffee shop. especially but in a small place. of business when a crazy thing. happens everyone who is not the craziness. becomes best friends right. so he walked in and he said science. is everywhere and walked out now. i [ __ ] you not i [ __ ] you not there was a hot girl there and an italian guy the italian guy. became one of my best. friends and i had an affair. with the beautiful woman okay. so that crazy guy disrupted. that coffee shop so much. that i had a relationship and a relationship because of it. 2008 beautiful years so now. flash forward to a [ __ ] two days ago. i'm the craziness now i didn't walk in and say science. is everywhere or [ __ ] when is a fire. not a fire or some crazy. [ __ ] right but everyone's looking at me and then two people are talking about oh i don't know yeah i think he threw some and i'm oh and real loudly i just say oh oh yeah no i i just i didn't mean to. if i was gonna hit i'm sorry. dude right now i'm [ __ ] scared because i got ptsd. because i think [ __ ] soon it's gonna be like crazy star of undateable. crystalline throws a [ __ ] wallet. at some portly guy walking. in the same door he does. dahlia responds reps for delia. responds he uh well he walked into. the door he doesn't usually walk. into and then when and then and science is everywhere. and then that guy's up hey what do you guys. think of it and then some [ __ ] long surfer hair. duders like dude oh uh i forget but we caught up. with bernie spears there's another there's a i saw the ninth. documentary about bernie spears yesterday. um and i sat down and i'm just like sitting down and i'm like all right. it's fine nobody really got and this. is like these are the thoughts i'm happening. like everything's fine and then all of a sudden. just to make matters. weirder these two like kids. brothers came in with in like karate keys. and with a dad and the dad. was like just go sit over. there and he like pointed. at my table and i'm just like ah for [ __ ] what is ha. i'm sitting and then i now i got like two karate. kids next to. me and and and they don't have masks. on which is fine. i don't care about that. at all but a kid. turns over to me and goes up. to and sneezes and i'm like dude. i didn't even know nine. year olds [ __ ] knew how to. sneeze yet and this kid sneezes on me with a karate key. and he sneaks and i'm like oh for [ __ ] and i swear to. god the kid says to. the dad dad i'm gonna take off my shoes. and the dad's like no. you're not gonna take off. your shoes and he says yes i am and he takes off his shoes. and i'm all right you know. what honestly that's an l. dude this coffee bean. and tea leaf experience it's just straight. up l i [ __ ] took my l. i took the coffee and i walked out. and i waited for my fiancee. to pick me up. because my car is in the shop. sabitch sat down took a [ __ ] made up did a uh uh um an instagram post about it where i just sat on the i have my life rips um on but you know what's uh yeah oh dude [ __ ] speaking of instagram i posted this thing about how bone tugs and harmony. i talk [ __ ] about i guess i talked [ __ ] about bon tok i mean i'm joking. obviously uh bone talks and harmony. on by some episode it. was like episode some episode i don't know previously. on congratulations first of all worst. name of a rap. group ever bone thugs and. harmony and i was talking about. bump dogs and harmony and um they wrote an article about it. about cr crystallia this. is rap group bone thugs and harmony. and it was so funny. dude like this this woman. who wrote the article was like yeah chris chris um you know. crystalia was talking [ __ ] about busy bone. but you know i i would he came into. the i don't know if you heard the episode. but he came into. the meanwhile as a patio. comedy store i was talking my brother. and he was like part. of my [ __ ] interruption he said it. 19 times and i was talking about how silly it was and then the late and then the lady wrote the later darker. was like oh yeah crystalia. made fun or or talked [ __ ] to. about busy bone and when he has a notoriously horrible uh childhood. and it's like don't like yo first of all it's comedy. second of all i'm the [ __ ] because i don't know every [ __ ] waking fact about one of the bone. thugs and harmonies i like i gotta know. about the [ __ ] everyone's childhood. before i joke the [ __ ] if i know one time this was years ago. but i made fun of somebody on. instagram for doing something silly and she wrote me. and she was like not cool. i had cancer and i'm like i gotta know. everything sorry you have that i can't make fun. of a yoga move. though crystallia star of undateable.
