[ __ ] not here he's literally on vacation which is [ __ ] [ __ ] okay that's shitty to. do it to. uh to leave us hanging like that is. shitty yeah we don't like. that and also here's the deal. he went on vacation and uh [music]. last time was it. last time he had no. was i think it was actually. two shows ago and we could talk about this. now because he's not here no it. was definitely the last it. was okay cool every day's the same. day in a way so i never know. oh so um so he we ran out. of videos say it right. say it right say it. right he ran out of videos. he he he collects the [ __ ] dozens of videos. no we have we have hundreds of videos. i'm saying do we how many how many do you think we have that. we haven't used if you had to. get 100 we have hundreds i know. but i'm saying per week. i guess but we we got through. them and it wasn't like we ran. through them it wasn't like we burned. through them at all it wasn't like we were like fix. your life next yeah we weren't doing that. yeah but he but we ran through. them yeah well we didn't run. through them but we got through them right. and then he was like that was it. that's it that's the videos. right so then he asked for some advice. which is very cool you get to. understand you know our producer chris and like his struggles. yeah he was talking about how do i lose. weight and stick to. a plan but we cut out. the part where it was like yeah. we cut out the part. where it was like it. made him look bad oh about. how running out of videos. yes not not okay yeah we want. the raw [ __ ] here at lifeline. yeah you know and if you're a fan. of my podcast congratulations. if you're a fan of my [ __ ] you know i'm wrong which is what you get the fact that he cut it out now. that's a nono right. we don't like that but that's what. he did but that's a nono. but what i want to. be clear about is that he made a mistake. right because we were talking. about it earlier. and we were like yeah but before we started recording. we were like well what the [ __ ] remember we ran. out of videos right. and then matt was like yeah it. was his fault yeah. and i was like yeah well you know i mean. it's not like we ran. through him but you know i guess i just wanted to. know how many videos we had queued up. today and he was like it. was his fault and he kept saying. it was his fault. and i was like yeah you think it is and he was like yes. and i was like maybe you're right. and then i said but what percentage and you didn't. answer this i said let's wait. you talk about on the podcast. oh right that's right. yeah so i said i was very ready. to answer so what percentage do you think it's his fault. that we didn't have enough. videos for the last episode one. hundred percent come on you think it's a hundred percent. it's one hundred percent so. all right if we have hundreds of videos. and he only put six up. like what if we did more okay. why don't you just pad. it just pat it okay. okay just pat it. okay then i have another question. then okay what if he had 20. videos queued up and we burned. through all of them and it was under an hour. whose fault is that whose fault. is it i mean i would say that's nobody's fault. that would be our fault. because we're not spending enough. time okay so so it can't. be a hundred percent. his fault then if six i think it. was actually seven or eight. videos what if he'd what if he'd put two videos then then his fault. would have been then it would 100. there you go that's i'm saying. is sliding then it's a sliding. scale but if it's if it's too little it's always here. so you think under 10. is 100 his fault. yes eight is his fault. a hundred percent eight is. a yeah okay exactly ten. is the right ten would be maybe i'd be like okay. it starts to. be not his fault. nine is like you really feel getting nine is like maybe it's nine to. be perfectly honest but it's it's his fault. last episode his fault. and we deeply apologize. is the thing but most of the thing. is we deeply apologize because he's not. on camera so we apologize. on his behalf. right right but the truth. is it got cut in a way. that that didn't even seem like he was. seeking advice he wanted to. make sure oh right. okay so right now we got it. okay so that's why all right. so that's why people didn't understand. yeah but we are exposing. him so basically he's exposed we're exposing chris. the producer and he's not here right. he's not even he could. say and we've talked about this for four. minutes and he's not going to. cut it out because there's no four minutes. and we're going to do. just enough time right right. to where he can't cut it. out because i know the podcast would be too short. he better not he better. not try i love figuring stuff. out like that okay if i had that conversation with dad it would have been so much more annoying what would have been an hour. it would have been the whole year. right we got it to. zero videos yes yes and we would have still had. videos for next time and that would have. been dad's fault yeah that's true. dude you know that's like the [ __ ] how many me stripping stripping. stripping the sandstorm that would be so bad. dude no dude that's like the number. one strip no you know what's the number one. strip super song i wanna [ __ ] you like an anime [music]. song i mean i had no [ __ ] idea what that was and also what part of said song because that doesn't sound. like anybody well they all kind of sound the same. but this one goes i heard [music]. so rude how close your hand is to. my face also were you saying like don't interrupt me. is that what that was yeah. well yeah here it comes so. [ __ ] rude dude if i just close your mouth like this and tan. it no or or you're like a lollipop. mister take me with you. yeah i know well now we got to. explain it okay. so go ahead that's the great. thing to explain mr. takemay was a guy a japanese. man who taught spanish very funny. in high school in high school. now we're not saying oh look all walks of life. all races can teach whatever. the [ __ ] they want equal opportunity. we're all about inclusion but look dude. mr takemay was a japanese guy. see it's good to. bring it up dude. he's a japanese guy. i probably talked about this all my pockets. at some point but just the this japanese. guy who [ __ ] uh he taught in japanese. thick accents yeah he would say uh he would yeah i mean he would say welcome. i mean like it was a tradition. like a japanese and you would be like yeah. and we were like it. was very and i remember was so confusing. and i remember one. time he was like these kid. the bad kids came in class. and they smelled of like drugs. and [ __ ] and alcohol and he was going ah [music]. and i was like what and he said and i was like what are you. saying and he said smoking. oh smoking i had him but he would go what. was the thing yeah yeah when you were talking. no you would go look. at his watch or whatever. you know like in between. on a walkietalkie it'll go [music]. why would he go because he was a human. walkietalkie okay human walking talk that's it. mr tech made the human. walkietalkie that sounds like a [ __ ] uh movie that what's his name who did the isle. of dogs would do oh wes anderson. yeah west anderson would do that. uh uh mr take amazing. isle of dogs yeah mr. take a may the what is it. the human walkie talkie would be made by the guy. who did the [ __ ] stop saying the guy just said wes anderson. i just said wesley i forget. what his [ __ ] name is wes anderson's name. dude you don't know anybody's name no that's not. true mr teckamay the human. walkietalkie mr tecamay i in my when i had him i made him i didn't make him but he was one of those teachers who was who were cool. he was a cool guy. actually and he let us pick. it wasn't like i had to. be mateo oh okay i could i was crystal. ball yeah yeah. i was zoro okay wow and he thought it. was funny and every time. i would raise my hand. and he would he would call. on me and he'd go oh yeah. well you're really bringing me back. with how he used to. talk he was doing it. you're right dude yeah just so like and he would wear hawaiian shirts. yeah wow he was like a very multicultural. individual he was he's probably dead. now huh oh so depressing. well he's probably even he was old. then he couldn't maybe he's 90. he's probably dead. yeah wow okay [ __ ] bummer r.i.p dude. you ruled yeah you're listening to. us up there in heaven. if you're or down there in hell he might be in hell you. know what he might be in hell for what. he showed us [ __ ] you know how like sometimes the teacher. would just be like [ __ ] i don't i just wanna yeah. like show you guys a movie yeah. you know yeah like i gave up today. yeah he showed us half. baked hopefully he's dead so now he's not exposed and so uh you get canceled. for that [ __ ] out of high school. half baked dude [ __ ] man. well yeah i'm [ __ ] exhausted and i'll tell you why dude because i was in uh austin. texas and then dallas. texas and then i flew home got. here took a ride to. my house got dressed took a shower that's why i look real. nice and then came here all. the way [ __ ] downtown doing lifeline. and now i have a spot at the laugh. factory later i rock it's fine i'm tired but i rock. right so this is the kind of [ __ ] i do to. bring you guys what you want. that's true that's too many. things though that's too many. things then i sleep. yeah and then you sleep. for [ __ ] ever you wake up. at three and i'm trying to. text you all [ __ ] morning. i will dude how do you feel about. the fact that we're both wearing blue. are you as upset. as i am no i like it. oh okay i like it i think it's good. because we haven't done it. until the seventh episode and we did. it we did all mismatch. and we didn't really the first episode. we were like what are you. wearing the second ever episode. i think we did it. and then after that we just mismatched and we didn't even mean. to and now he finally matches episode. seven it's the matching episode. and that's good dude. it took us seven episodes. to do that part's. true what do you think about wanna. do this it's unfortunate on the audio. you can't see what i'm doing. you're just nodding your head. but i'm doing it slow. and i'm closing my eyes. what do you think about this. it looks like you're finally getting. the blow job you wanted. like out of all the forever. i just think sometimes i stumble upon. things and i think that's how i'm going. to do that for the rest. of my life cool so now. when someone's talking and i'm agreeing. for the rest of my life. i'm just going to. do this looks like you're [ __ ] falling. asleep over and over again. like constantly waking up like yeah. yeah like this but i'm not because my eyes. are closed so i'm not doing the eye. roll thing okay well you said i was doing it. like i was falling. still not right well whatever. man my advice to. you is don't do that because people are going. to think you're the biggest [ __ ] of all time so that's my advice. to you on lifeline. okay all right thanks. so yeah dude rip roaring. this is my [ __ ] fourth coffee of the day. i'm so real that either. third coffee i'd even drink it. oh that's that's actually not real that's wasteful. i didn't drink i didn't mean. to do it because kristen at the airport. duch is the kind of [ __ ] person that gets a coffee. after we land. we're waiting for the bags. and she stops at the starbucks. we get all the bags. we're ready to leave. and she's waiting for not only her drink. which would be fine for my drink. that i didn't even ask her. to get dude so then she brought it. and i was like i was like just don't worry about it. she's like well i already paid. for it she brought in the car. and then i'm in this. [ __ ] internal battle where it's like oh i should drink it because she got it for me but i don't really want it but should i prove. a point and [ __ ] not drink it. or should i prove a point. to myself and just drink it. do you know what i'm saying. i do but i have a i have a solution. for you what step one. [ __ ] chill out about it for sure. right on me and step. two just do the thing. that you want to. do whether that's drink it. or not drink it then. he's not himself but when you really. know you did you really. know yourself do you really know. yourself in every aspect of every situation you don't. so that's what i did. i figured out myself. i'm very buddhist in. this but when it came up. you knew if you wanted the coffee. or not right did you want. the coffee i didn't want. it then then you don't drink. it but then she got it. for me i'm like and then i was like no. and in the car i was like looking. at it and it was just [ __ ] like the ice was melting and i didn't even [ __ ] drink it so this is my fourth coffee of the day and the third one i drank so it's your third coffee of the day fourth coffee day but i only drank three yeah third coffee of the day i mean technically what we were talking about if i ingested yesterday. yeah so it's your third. okay okay should we start yeah. let's start okay great most regular guy. of all time what's up. matt and chris hope you guys are doing well. quick question for you today. starting a band with my friends. we're gonna play some rock. and funk blues stuff like that i love. it i recommend it. the spin moves and they're on the fence about it. so any suggestions on your end. would be much appreciated. thanks a lot he wants. to know if he should start. a band with his friends. oh dude or the name is starting. a band with his friends. he wants to. know if he suggested the spin moves. yeah as a band name it's cool. name they it sounds like i don't. think they liked it but he's asking what should a band. name be i have it. why i have what i i don't want. let's back up first of all. the advice is don't start. a band with your friends. right why is that the advice. because it's gonna be bad but that's how the beatles. got started and they were bad. okay yeah yeah yeah she loves you. yummy hey yeah she loves you yeah yeah you're [ __ ] such a [ __ ] brat we all live in a yellow submarine no don't next okay what do you want only literal. lyrics yes why that's the best. dude but you can think that's the best. but to have only literally is the best. and the worst r b. is the best music. and the worst music. dude because they'll be like i'll [ __ ] you in the [ __ ] or they'll be like very frilly and like super [ __ ] contrived but also like uh give me an example uh make it up or don't it doesn't matter real song or not real song okay uh i mean they would be it would be like oh like they're [ __ ] like brian remember the [ __ ] my feminist says oh oh my god that was the hardest i've ever laughed when he's like a one where dad jump rings from two true i'd break. a thing soon do whatever the [ __ ] and there we bro he's just counting basically yeah. he is yeah right. so that's a bad song right. sounds kind of nice fat. black people love it i like brian. mcknight my family says like this. thing like yeah but but i'm just saying dude. um what are you saying. like water runs dry like that. song dude with the boys. to men dude okay but what should the guy. the guy should basically either. start an r b. band okay okay that is strictly. specific or not do a band. okay i don't like the advice. of not there you have it. do a band he's not asking that. the beatles are bad that's not what he's asking. either okay and and you're wrong. but that's not what he's asking either. back up don't do a boundary with your friends. if you have to. do a band with your friends. let's take the let's say that. yeah all right if you have to. do bad with your friends. then name your band name. your band not something [ __ ] cute. or stupid like death. cat for cuties okay okay. there's only or sparkle horses. that's cab for cutie not cuties who are you. mom what adding an s to. whatever i know pluralizing everything. i know i know mom won't be like get the chairs and there's one chair. and you lose your mind. and so uh death cab. for cutie or todd and the big heads. or whatever the [ __ ] that one is big head todd. so stupid you it should literally like the beatles. is a great band. name it should all be the white. stripes the start it with the something okay spin moves. is good okay but the reptiles the frogs. take that one i never heard it. dogs dude you're bad at this. no way i would rock i'm in the frogs. i would start we're saying the beetles because the beeto no no. i'm saying just it should be animals. or something and just not left. up to interpretation i have an idea okay. how about animals or something. for the band the animals. or something nah maybe the animals. no it's got to. be specific tigers tigers that's nice. that's [ __ ] so stupid wow. all right let's figure this out the detroit. tigers in the 90s anyway. um does blues that's what he said. one of the genres is blues. what was the other one he said. he did you said so many things remember uh blues. uh he said uh rock he said uh uh something else i don't know but it doesn't matter. all music you know what kind of music. he's gonna make you know. you know what kind of music. that guy's gonna make how would you describe it. my silhouette is broken like that. [ __ ] the broken silhouettes i just yeah i mean dude if you're starting a band and you don't know what to. call it you're already [ __ ] no come on get involved. from jump dude what get involved. from jump from jump hey guys i got an idea what are we doing we're going. to be the microphones. and these are the music. we're going to kind of play. are you in or out. dude be more of a leader. is he the also is he this. lead singer or is he the [ __ ] guitarist we don't know. he knows yeah i'm just saying i don't i don't. know what do you think anthony. yeah i'm not gonna i'm not gonna say. i'm not gonna say inappropriately. i'm not gonna says the singers. that would be [ __ ] the singers. the singers and guitarists. the the the the blues singers we rock. we rock that's the name we rock. okay we rock [ __ ] you okay. call it that's good that's good. [ __ ] you the band that's good. yup yup [ __ ] you the band you breaking the table no. that's good [ __ ] you the band [ __ ] you the band right. okay [ __ ] you the band that's the whole. name right mmhmm. yep and you see that. guy come out on stage. is hilarious just in a flannel. that's true bass pro. that's true uh hat [ __ ] you the band all right. cool great next we got it. here we go you want. to read it sure. oh this is a returner holy [ __ ] the emojis and everything. hey again matt and chris i'm back. in parentheses the one that wrote in wrote in that i black out. every time and find out. that i do the horizontal. mambo he blacks out and does we remember this. from a previous episode he blacks. out and doesn't remember that he has sex until like a the the department. next day the partner. texts him hey that was great. last night and he was like well. i had sex like it's a [ __ ] what was great. like he doesn't even. know yeah he's like he's like it's a [ __ ] what's his name movie. what's the guy from first. viewer's day off matthew matthew matthew. broderick like it's a matthew broderick movie in the a in the 90s. anyway go ahead okay anyways i wanted to. i had sex with a question. right that's what the movie's called. so go ahead cutting me off. so we did what stop doing. that okay but i'm just saying sarah jessica parker's. in it anyways i wanted. to add on to. what i wrote last. time because i found out a little more. about the situation [ __ ] uh oh well no but also that all you could do is find out. more about the situation because yeah. you don't know anything. about the situation because you blacked. out right so it turns out that one of the girls. i ran in into. bed that i ran into. bed with was actually my brother's exgirlfriend. of a while and now i seek for further. advice this [ __ ] piece of [ __ ] my question is do i tell my brother or keep it a secret also as chris said i drink because i can't stop but also because it gives me enjoyment okay well you don't really need the second one if you have the first one you know can't stop but also it makes me happy okay you know um like not i'm not a like robin i can't stop robbing banks i didn't know if this guy could get like darker. and he's done it yeah you know. well i mean he just he doesn't know. like he's just probably like he's got a bunch of problems. you know uh should you tell your brother. though that's the advice should you tell your brother. that you had sex with his ex. when you blacked out. and drank okay in all honesty what i think he should and let me. tell you why okay. because assuming you love. he loves his brother and cares. what his brother thinks obviously something. like that might even though. it's him doing it to. himself it could be this. like selfinflicted punishment that he needs. to feel like he's hit rock. bottom he needs to. hit rock bottom it's like he's doing the [ __ ] la like the right catholics do like in the show servant yeah or the girls on the ground. and selfflagellation selfflagellation when she yeah she thinks about oh i want [ __ ] dick and she's like oh okay well whatever that's actually you're adding that part. right yeah well what was it. in that movie that show. i don't remember it wasn't i want. dick well if you if you're if you're if you're having impure. thoughts one of those impure thoughts. is if you're a woman. is i need that dick. and then you gotta go selflegitimate. all i'm saying is you made that. part up well not no. yeah it for for what the show. yeah but also if you are a catholic. and you start thinking i need that [ __ ] dick. horizontally you gotta then go get the [ __ ] cat of ninetales and selfflagellate that is true. but you made it up. that's all that's my only thing. i'm just saying it in religion. the priest would tell you to. do that but go ahead. in religion you know. uh i think that you have to. tell your brother because your brother. might have a reaction that makes you really. get your [ __ ] together and make you make you obviously we didn't [ __ ] help. he's still doing it. well well this was also a followup. i found out more. about the situation so maybe he did stuff. right right well here's the thing. if you stopped you should tell them. yeah and say frame it. around gotta come clean i. didn't i used to. be like this and i've stopped and i've i just i i've learned. something about one of my experiences when this. happened and whatever yeah and if you haven't. stopped yet i would i would say there's even. more of an imperative to. tell them because you need that. rock bottom to pad reasons for you. to motivate yourself to. stop yeah it's not just about drinking. dude this is [ __ ] [ __ ] up [ __ ] man you're i mean i already went over this i don't need to. get all the way deep into. the thing that he does. but this is another level. it's not just another layer. it's a whole other level. you [ __ ] your brother's exgirlfriend and mother's ex. is a hoe no yeah we're not. forgetting that part dude. she doing them both dude. that's fine she can do. whatever she wants well. yeah but so can he no that's different. dude he's doing it. to his own. brother she's just a woman in the world. she doesn't necessarily need to. like be that's not on what planet. is it not hoey to. [ __ ] brothers i don't know this this planet. yeah yeah yeah years between. come on years. between what what if it's years between. oh it's years between yeah i mean. i guess but then okay if it doesn't matter and it's years. between then why is he coming. up with it you're saying because it's his brother. and he should come clean. yeah also here's the other thing. too what if they were like what. if like when he was drunk. and blacked out she. didn't know he was blacked. out and she was like we're not gonna tell anyone he's like yup. we're not gonna tell everyone anyone. even your brother and he's like yup. and then he does the horizon. to mambo and then now he's feeling. guilty and he's like well i gotta tell him. but they already agreed. on the [ __ ] that dude. this [ __ ] [ __ ] up he's got to. eat it yeah eat it. eat it change because it's inside. you and that shit's going. to become cancer okay but you got to. eat that [ __ ] man if you made a pact with the chick. also if you're very close with the brother. you gotta i can't imagine doing that. to you and not telling you you. gotta say yeah true true. you gotta say it's all. also it's it's there's so many things going on here. wow this guy's in trouble. yeah yeah but change i think my advice. to you is change change you know. yeah you're living you're living not it's not. a right the right. way right because the black and white change. the blacking out thing. alone is one thing that's [ __ ] up you should get help. they're blacking out and having sex. and not remembering it. at all big problem. is real bad he's real. bad yeah yeah yeah forgetting the donkey. and then absolutely i also think he should talk. to this woman and be like what was i like yeah. good good good happened. like what the [ __ ] happened good advice i give good advice too but that's good. advice okay yeah and that's so good i think you gotta tell them. and that's that's the end of it. but go to her first. and say yo i'm going. to tell my brother how about that. well that's yes yes because you can't blindside her it. sucks dude you both did. this that's a that's [ __ ] yeah you're that's you're right you got to. talk to her first. yeah yes dude i got one. one you did get one. one to one yeah all right. go ahead next yo what's up. what's up matt big fan. i'm so glad you guys are doing this. pod oh yeah so here here's my dilemma. um how do i take your seatbelt. off that is a serial cheater uh she cheats. on her boyfriend all the time. and i don't know her boyfriend. that well but when i did meet him. he seems like just the nicest guy. in the world and she has nothing but great. things to say about him. and i'm curious on what i should do. about this if anything um you know i hate to. that he has to. go through this unknowingly um i've told her plenty of times that she should just be single she. obviously doesn't want that and uh you know. to make matters worse. they have a family together. they have kids so you know. i don't know maybe it's just not. my place i should just stay out of it. um but you know she tells me. this these stories of her you know. messing around with these other guys. and i can't help but feel bad. for the guy especially when i see him. and you know we we all. hang out as a group and you you know. it's just a dilemma and i'm wondering. if i should play any part. of this at all or just ignore. it and live my own. life like i've been doing. let me know what you think. thanks i feel like you know. he's friends with her i don't know how close he is with her. sounds like they're close. but he he's definitely not close. with him you can tell yeah no there. he's just met him. a few times so it's not like you're his friend. it's like you're her friend. yes you don't you don't know. their relationship 100 my i'm always like you. got to let people live their path. and figure out what they are. figure out their own. lives especially they have a family. yeah you got to. let them bump into. the wall on their own. yeah all right but what i think is first. things first if he was his friend it'd be a different story right. first things first i would say talk to. her about it and it makes but base it. around like you in a way. like this makes me uncomfortable. i don't i don't know and like and see what she says but he's already. done that and she's he he says she's brought it. up yeah well he said like yo. maybe you should just be single but he has maybe he probably hasn't. had a real sit down with her. you know i think the thing. also is that he needs to. say stop telling me about this. [ __ ] oh yeah for sure like why are you telling me because it's making him uncomfortable and then he meets the guy. and he's like yeah he's like [ __ ] philip seymour hoffman in the big. lebowski he's like oh hi. you know what i mean. totally dude and i think that. that why why is she i think that's something. worth examining on its own. why the [ __ ] is she telling. you about this [ __ ] like is it what's her tone is she confessing is she ashamed. that's one thing but if she's just like yeah. i [ __ ] messed around. with this guy and like i i i you don't want to. hear that [ __ ] and so i'm giving this is this is like protection for you. i'm giving you advice. i don't know her oh yeah. and i don't know the guy. the advice we don't know. him really about it's the [ __ ] yeah but he's asking for trust and it's about his life dude. tell her to [ __ ] stop telling you about this. [ __ ] and then also ask her why the [ __ ] do you tell me in the first place like what the like like why why are you airing this out to. me like what do you think is what are you getting. out of it like also this. is all all of this. makes me uncomfortable when you tell me about it. it makes me uncomfortable so stop telling me if you care. about our friendship stop making. me uncomfortable yeah just be yeah he could be like i don't really want. to be a part of this. yeah you know that that's the main. thing yes but i don't think you i mean. if you go and you talk to. the guy you barely know. him i mean the guy. could have a reaction like [ __ ] you stay out of her business. you know but i think if he's gonna do anything. like that he should talk to. her yes that's the key. and say like you know. what to come clean honestly. tell the kids first no i think that you you. talk to her is the main thing. and you say yo just so you know. i don't like when you talk. about this [ __ ] with me yeah just keep your side. of the street clean right. yeah i think that's the main. the main goal yeah and then it might turn into. a conversation where you have. an opening to like not. judge her right but like ask. her like why a few things. why you tell she tells you in the first. place but also why maybe she does it. or or whatever maybe she he'll glean. something that yeah i don't i mean. i doubt they have an open. relationship yeah what he's saying but you i don't know. and so i just think that limiting. this to being about you and not passing. judgment on anyone tell her. it makes you uncomfortable. yeah and that you don't. want to hear about it. anymore i wonder how she tells them too like they're just homies. that's what i'm saying it's [ __ ] weird. dude she's just like yo we're still on. for dinner and then she's like yeah i'll see you at five. i gotta suck a dick. at 4 30. you know like i really wonder what it. is about the guy's just like i really wonder how she tells him. yeah so it sounds like there's multiple instances it. could be guys yeah you know. because it was once. or twice he probably wouldn't call into. maybe it's like an affair. a single affair yeah that's that's also that would make it different. too yeah that makes it. different i mean if it's multiple dudes if she's just out. there [ __ ] with her mouth open you know right like on [ __ ] a street corner also dude the guy with her mouth open is uh is that an expression. no wow okay yeah i make up. expressions my babies okay so maybe he's like on this. like but also he's playing it. real close here like doing it. on my flight dude. like hundreds of thousands of people are gonna see this. and uh and somebody's going to. see it and the the boyfriend. might see it the boyfriend's. probably a huge fan of ours. he probably is yeah and so he's going. to be like wait a minute. yep and you know. he thought about that yeah. you know well hopefully it's all okay. and everything works out so basic. so basically but i hope that [ __ ] you know this could lead to. a [ __ ] murder life this because this is on this podcast this could lead to. a [ __ ] homicide okay relax. i'm just dude you got to. think of all angles. and then also i'll turn on like [ __ ] fear thy neighbor and then it'll be like oh [ __ ] and we'll be on it what's fear the neighbor it's where like a neighbor goes bonkers and shoots everybody in the [ __ ] shoots their neighbors it's a show yeah it's a [ __ ] and dramatization there's a show about there's enough neighbors killing. neighbors that there's shows yeah fear thy neighbor. and then there's fear thy roommate. no yeah and there's fear that i mean. everyone's out there killing. each other dude sounds like it. huh they're making fear thy [ __ ]. home depot and play um but yeah dude. everyone's out there killing. each other dude so be careful. man you don't want this. to lead to a [ __ ] homicide is my point i mean. obviously yeah but dude. he's [ __ ] i'm telling you. man you don't want to. be in [ __ ] fear of my name or season. five and we might be in fear that neighborhood. season five because a [ __ ] timberland look like came in and did this [ __ ] video yeah yeah we'll be interviewed for it and [ __ ] that's what i'm saying and they seem like i saw footage archive footage of this [ __ ] he seemed like a nice guy you know like that yeah exactly when there's a murderer dude i'll tell you something man because it's always that unless they make a whole. documentary that's a mini series and then it's like yeah he always he. was very creepy right. like if it's just one episode. about a guy it's always yeah. it was weird they'd come in and he was nice we didn't have any [ __ ] idea but bro if you're talking about a guy that's like like they'd spend time on those [ __ ] and documentaries yeah. like if it was john wayne. gacy everyone kind of knew. they were like gabe boasted. all the time he was very weird. john my gesture was even like you start. to dig about that guy. i know it just gets weirder i know. that's exactly right yeah although also if you didn't know that somebody was a serial killer and you knew them. you're a [ __ ] idiot like let's just say that. say that again everyone's always like we had no idea right. how about this you're a [ __ ] idiot you know what i think all the time. i think a person's a serial. killer yeah i know. that's what i'm saying that's what. you're saying it's like and like you're wrong. half the time but you air. on the side i've always probably got bodies. you're wrong way more than half. the time you know there's not. that many [ __ ] serial killers but yeah i think about you like that. that's like you know who dude. if anyone in my life. was a serial killer and then it gets. exposed yeah and then they're like did. you ever i'm gonna be like oh yeah no i could definitely say. i was that guy you're [ __ ] the only person. in the history though yeah but they wouldn't use my footage. because they wanted to. seem like the [ __ ] drastic difference right. right right right i knew [ __ ] yeah it's so obvious look at we buttons all the way up. with his crazy glasses. yeah right yeah buying roses. for girls he barely knows. right yeah all right. dude so next all right. next what's up matt what's up. chris so i got this friend who uh he was a groomsman at my wedding. i flaked on the rehearsal. i invited him to. my daughter's first birthday. flaked on that jesus and then well. before that was my bachelor. party i invited him uh to. that was super stoked for him. to come out and he flaked. on that god and he didn't have. any excuses for all these times that. he's flaked on these huge moments. in my life he just didn't show. up i've confronted this. guy my best friend and i've been friends with him. since middle school and i'm 28. now so i don't know however. long that is over a decade. trying to figure out um whether to. keep him around in my life. or not every time i see him. now he's like says how much he you know loves hanging out. with me and how he misses me. and you know we always have. a good time hanging out but i always have uh always kind of eats. at me a little bit. all those things that he didn't show. up for me for yeah. no [ __ ] um because those are i think those are pretty important. things and you know i trusted him. wanted him to be there. for me and he wasn't you. know especially for my daughter's. birthday that that was kind of yeah. kind of the nail. in the coffin for me. so i'm just trying to. figure out whether i should keep him. in my life or not whether he's even. more worth my time. because i don't think i'll ever you know. i've kind of forgiven him but i don't know. if i'll ever forget those. things you know so am i being too dramatic. should i let it go. and move on try. to try to. figure it out with him. or has he done enough. to where i should just just cut him. off you know he's not even worth. it anymore so any advice. would be appreciated thanks. guys cool i think that maybe like it's like one. of those things was like should i keep him. in my life uh any anymore. when it's like he's already making that. decision for you he's not in your life. because he's not coming to. the [ __ ] important things these things are you know like i dude i i had to. figure this out too like you know. people want you there for certain things. and if you're not there you know. once is fine twice. okay but then you're just an [ __ ] like you know if people are constantly not showing up. for you in your life. then what is a friend. somebody you text with somebody. you just run into. at the bar somebody that you get lunch. with this is your wedding. this is your [ __ ] uh daughter's birthday. like i have people that i have people like that. in my life where i'm just like okay. you know i have i have one buddy. that just called me and he was like i'm not. gonna be able to. come to your wedding. and i'm like all right that's kind of the last straw. dude you know like i love you. bud but like you obviously don't want to. be a part of my life. anymore you know and it's different. case by case but i think that i think that dude. it's just uh i don't know. man i mean he's answering. your question for you yeah. i i actually i should say i'm i'm not like this. like when people don't want to. come to [ __ ] that of mine. i don't ever care because i understand. why people wouldn't want to. go to a thing because i don't want. to go to hell yeah. but people aren't like you but that being said i totally understand. where this guy's coming from. and i way understand very very very much understand. that i'm in the minority. in that way yeah yeah. so that being said i think that you should at. least explain to. him or not give him. another chance but like let him know what's going on. right and if you're gonna as you say cut. him out that's totally your prerogative. but i i think you should at least. uh tell him and not just like stop entirely. contacting this guy yeah. i guess so yeah yeah then he's gonna be like hey dude yeah yeah then you're maybe the bad guy yeah. but also also people grow people change. and then friends you gotta treat them. like an army like sometimes. people are front line. [ __ ] you put the idiots up there right that was gonna shut the [ __ ] up and the generals are gonna be good in the back. but you also need the generals. right you need the generals. and those people to. make decisions with those people that come to. your [ __ ] daughter's birthday. party right and then you got the [ __ ] guys who fled the planes you got all the other. [ __ ] you got the navy you got the [ __ ] you know and maybe this guy is just a frontline [ __ ] that is is supposed to. get popped right away right. you got to have those guys. in your life right. yeah you got to. have those guys when the drawbridge opens on the beaches of normandy. and just [ __ ] pop that's this. dude and he just goes all. right you know maybe your friend. is the guy looking for his. arm and saving private ryan so disrespectful to. the fallen but but no what i think is. you you can also there's another option which is to. sort of like reconsider recontextualize how good of a friend. this guy is you don't it's not either. he's this amazing friend. who comes to your daughter's. birthdays or i don't talk. to this [ __ ] at all if he's a front seat friend if he was he can be a backseat friend now he doesn't need to. be front seat friend. or he's out of the [ __ ] car do you know what i'm saying like he can just be a different kind of you kind what i was saying but in a different way better. well i was doing it. with the army [ __ ] way right but i'm doing it i'm doing it a little bit with a bitchass. car like a [ __ ] dodge. knee no car a car. i'm sticking with the car metaphor. yeah yeah go buy his house. drive by and and [ __ ] when you and when he pops honk the horn. when he pops his head. out the window just go like this. hit the windows down and go like this. wow what what like you were up. here oh and now you're down. here so you think that motherfucker's. gonna understand no i don't oh. i think he'll call him. afterwards and be like what the [ __ ] was that all about and then was that you like what the [ __ ] he's gonna say i was just showing you where you were and now where you are if you'd like to. make a call please hang up. and try again message. c5 taking it so far. digging so far remember that. [ __ ] no what's message c5. they would do that at the end. on the [ __ ] land lines. yeah and then it was [ __ ] it would happen. so it would go you would hang up. and then we'll go and then we'll go and then you know. let you know it's off. the hook really loudly and then if you left. that going in the 90s. it would say message c5. yeah whatever the [ __ ] i i don't i've never heard that. a boy likes to. see what the [ __ ] happens. when i leave [ __ ] alone and i think you're lying okay i'm not lying. okay well i decided that you are okay. well that's what makes you wrong. one of us has to. be nope all right next. one hi matt hi chris. i mean the tick tock. my question to you guys. is what would you suggest. i do in a situation where i was seeing. somebody quite a long time. ago beginning of the year. didn't last very long no. longer seeing each other nothing. dramatic happened for the parting of ways. prior to hooking up loose. friends have a lot of mutual friends. however it's becoming apparent that this. person is trying to. keep a connection keep going you're not really getting. the hint i'm trying to. sort of let it die. it doesn't seem to. be working and at what point. do i swing the hammer. and say something that's forceful or do. i just continue to. hope that they'll get the hint through. nonengagement uh are you uh guys don't take uh hint very. well yeah they don't take a hit very. well and you gotta and they always and guys are always like i wish these [ __ ] chicks would just tell so just [ __ ] tell them also what's with the [ __ ] tick tock that's hilarious. what's the tick and also in the back. was there like an animal drinking. there was a dog. drink of water yeah yeah i'm very perceptive and i knew. that before you no. i knew it before you. okay so um yeah i mean you don't like this. guy like that you know. you had sex or whatever. you hooked up and then he wanted. to be friends and you just you got the ick or whatever. the [ __ ] people from australia. say right she's like yeah what do you mean. what the [ __ ] do you think she's not from the midwest. you know why she's you know. why she's australian but besides the accent. because she's from australia. no besides that she's got a lot. of tattoos dude austria you can find somebody. with no tattoos on australia you can't they're [ __ ] two years. old at three they're like yeah. i'll get a pacifier yeah if i get i look. to get a [ __ ] i want to. get a paw patrol. across my chest i swear. to god dude you cannot find. a [ __ ] australian without 90 tattoos it's unbelievable okay okay so that's how you know she's just trying to. show the voice okay and um yeah dude. just you gotta i don't i i don't know. man it's like don't it's like this. guy wants to. look you're attractive he had sex. with you he wants to. probably keep you in the rotation. right he probably is because he unless cause it. doesn't sound like you guys. wanted to be boyfriend. or girlfriend right the guy. probably wants to. keep you around but you know. he wants the milk. but he doesn't want to.

you some great. advice and i'll give you a little context. on my issue we've been hanging out with this. dude and his wife for a while. you know like five or six. months right we all became pretty close. they integrated to. our friendship friend group really. well and um not too long. ago we found out that he was beating her. right hitting her you know. verbally abusing her and when we first heard about it. we never really witnessed it. so we just told him. like hey you got to. stop we're going to kick your ass. right this is not good. needs to be over but it's happened. again so at this. point i've completely written this guy. off he's not my friend anymore. and um jesus i really want to. just kick this guy's teeth. in right you know teach him. a lesson but part of me. maybe the more rational side of me. thanks you know. i'm all i'm already in some trouble. with the military i so i really should just kind of lay low. at this point but trouble. with the mobility really just wants to. kick the [ __ ] out of this guy you know i'll do a spin move and knock him out. i don't care that's about. playing my imaginary mandolin and kick his teeth. down his throat like i'm tired. of this guy i just wanted to. know what y'all would do in my situation. um should i go through. with it should i err on the side. of caution um that's it. all right i mean imagine if that's what. he did wow imagine if that's what. he did he just [ __ ] and then just continued to. kick this [ __ ] out hold on dude. you're not okay look this. is a [ __ ] [ __ ] up situation terrible but you're not batman you can't so you don't just go kick the [ __ ] out of somebody also you'll go to. [ __ ] jail yeah this guy should go to. jail if that's what's happening. this other guy should that's what i was going. to say so just call the cops. yeah i mean obviously it's on her. she's gotta you gotta talk. to her about it. yeah but like because you can't. do a thing that she doesn't want. you to do you gotta listen. to what the woman wants and that's complicated. but you have to. um that being said you you can't. kick the [ __ ] out of him. oh yeah because then you would end up in jail. yeah but also what if you lose. oh you really think and then just like right. before he even gets a shot. off but something tells me that. this guy can kick the [ __ ] out of many many many because he's in trouble. with the miller any guy that's in trouble. with the military yeah also i mean. how did he just sneak. that in there by the way. i'm already in trouble. with the military he's in the military. or he's the taliban. no man he's in the military. i'm saying or he did 911. no. you don't get in trouble. with the military if you're the taliban. is in trouble with the military. they are but that's not what you [ __ ] say okay i'm just saying he wouldn't say he was in the taliban. he like had to. go to the brig or some [ __ ] he's like in trouble like maybe he went awol something. like that maybe or not a [ __ ] terrorist he could be isis. i'm just saying all right anyway. it looked like an isis. video he was you know what i mean. right sounds a voice too by. holding somebody's head zooms out uh wait no it's a guy's head you got you're already. if you're already in trouble. legally with some part yeah the branch. of the united states government yes even more you can't kick the [ __ ] out of this [ __ ] guy but i see why you think that way you know why because you think that way and your history proves it so don't do what you do yeah right sit back relax. talk to this woman. yeah try to. get her to [ __ ] call the police yes because this is a violent. crime yes i mean. this isn't like hey this guy keeps stealing my money. yeah or like [ __ ] taking taking my lunch. money right this is a guy. beats this [ __ ] out of a woman which is [ __ ] up in any way yeah so yeah uh yeah dude i mean that is a first of all that's such a terrible [ __ ] situation for you yeah we joke. around a lot but that's [ __ ] that's not the situation. anybody should have to. find themselves in this. for that woman first of all. but something like that is it. makes so many waves and [ __ ] touches on so many other things outside of the one [ __ ] unit of people it's just so bad for everybody involved but you gotta get you gotta not kick the share of this guy you gotta restrain yourself in that department. although i can relate i would wanna do the same. i do want to. do the same i don't even [ __ ] know this guy but he deserves to. get the [ __ ] kicked out of him. but you can't do it so you will. not do it you will. talk to this woman. and you will try to. first of all be open to. what she has to. say don't be like you got to. go to the [ __ ] cops you got to. do it now yeah talk to. her hear what she has to. say and try to. navigate the conversation in such a. way that it becomes a conversation. about going to the authorities. in some capacity because he is not going to. stop doing it no he's not going. to just be like if there's no consequence. certainly he's not going to. stop take him on springer yeah. but take him on jerry springer yeah. but no you know what i mean. cause you could beat the [ __ ] out. of people on that show. and for some reason nobody ever gets arrested. yeah that's true actually um wow. that's a heavy one. man jesus christ talk to. her restrain yourself in terms of physical. violence talk to her. and try desperately to. get her to to. to to to to want to. go to the authorities you know you do put kilos of coke. in his trunk and then call the cops. anonymously and be like i know this guy is distributing. drugs and then that guy gets in huge trouble. and the girl won't get beaten. anymore you got to. think outside the box. dude well that's way outside the box. but uh i wouldn't recommend that. i would recommend what i said. we'll see uh but i understand. why you'd want to. kick the [ __ ] out of this yeah talk to. her first the worst [ __ ] thing you can do talk to. her first if she doesn't want to. you know she's like no i love him. and you know she's like in one. of those relationships yeah yeah then [ __ ] plant some kilos of coke. and it's in the back of his [ __ ] goddamn chevelle. or whatever it is call. the cops wow cops i got a hot. tip can't tell you who will you know do the [ __ ] taliban thing. right well that makes me mad. it makes me mad what does. the taliban thing no man. not you the the guy [ __ ] said uh yeah [ __ ] up [ __ ] up well maybe we got another one i mean so made us well like that this way guys my name is jet i'm 22 i'm in college and um i have a question about how to. sort of control um the universe. you're in your mind um this. is anger in relation. to an idea that chris has talked about on his podcast. where he makes up fake. scenarios in his head oh yeah. just so he can get mad. at them yeah um like he'll make up. a fake argument and then like what he'll say. in the fake argument and it just gets like super worked. up and i i found that i do. the same thing i think it's pretty. cool um and it does. feel good to indulge yourself. into those fake scenarios and get angry. and you know anger. sometimes feels really good but um i was wondering um if there's a way to. stop that because it's starting to. affect how i see people. in real life like if i have a fake. argument with my friend in my head. or something then i start. to like genuinely like have negative. feelings towards them and it's like it's like not um good. something that should be happening. so i was just curious like chris i know. you've struggled with this um and maybe you've figured out a way to. put a stop to. it you definitely haven't um but i'd love to. hear your thoughts on it. matt as well um thank you. so much cool i mean. i would suggest working out. and getting that address uh. aggression out but it looks like he's fit he probably. does work out he is. fine he definitely serves there's no doubt. in well here's the thing. he's 20 what do you say. 222 that's really really young. to already think that like you only get angrier. like you only get angrier. unless you're thinking about it. which i guess he is thinking about it. you know hopefully he's talking to. somebody about his anger. i mean but like dude. i'm in the car all day. long and i i'll just out of nowhere. i'll be like oh you think so you know. what i mean and then off and by the way. i don't even know who i'm at. yet and then i'll pick one. of my friends and i'll be like that's who it. is today yeah i do that. and then i do understand. so you're crazy you're a crazy. guy well yeah i mean i think more people do that. i think more people do that. than i think you probably do that. ah i think you talk. to yourself in your car. and you imagine arguments that you get into. sometimes i think well one time. i was driving down the street. and i was doing it. i looked next to. me and i got a guy was [ __ ] doing it to. another guy one of his friends. i wonder if it was the same. friend i don't i don't think i've done. that i do crazy. [ __ ] not that though mmhmm. um but this guy's let me. get this straight because he's talking about. you that's what you do. yeah you talk about having fake. arguments for people to. like get it out like get out. of your way yeah like well no not. even necessarily but like i'll be [music]. like okay take something that your friend. does like take like say you have a friend. that's always late okay. and you're you'll be in you know. he says in the car. but you can do it. anywhere right you're just daydreaming and you're like okay like say my the guy i bring on the road. with me michael noche say he's always late. he's not but [music]. we if we have a gig. say this weekend in atlanta we'll be like oh i'll be thinking about it. and i'll be like oh they better. not be [ __ ] late right and then i'll be like because he's always [ __ ] late and then i'll be like in atlanta in my mind. he'll be showing up. and i'll be like it's [ __ ] late and in my head and i'm driving i'm in the car. and i'm just like i can't. believe you're [ __ ] late again. now it's me all of a sudden. i'm saying it out loud. i can't believe you're [ __ ] late again. and then i'll do his part. in my head and then i'll be like you know. what if you and i'll come up with ideas. of how the conversation is going. to go if it happens. in atlanta and then i'm all [ __ ] riled up. yeah and then either it. happens or it doesn't that weekend. in atlanta and if it does happen. if it doesn't happen. it's [ __ ] [ __ ] i shouldn't have got all that out in the car anyway yes because now i'm feeling angry. at him or it. does happen in atlanta and i think i know. what to say but he's not going. to say what i think i s yeah. exactly because conversation he's a different. person yeah so it's but so i you know i don't know if it's good. or bad that i do it. but i'm in my car. having these conversations and i'm really. sticking it to. him man and i'm doing real. good you know i'm doing real. good in my head i'm winning. the argument but mostly because it's in my head. and he's saying the things that i want him. to say that i know how to. come back well if he says this. i'll say that if he says this i'll say that. right you need help. i'm getting it you need. help getting maybe you need a little bit more. help but i think that maybe a more like controlled. way to do this. one that doesn't increase rage. is to like write. it out as if it was a letter. and contain your thoughts. in a way that is like a persuasive argument. thoughtful and you think it. all the way through and then you never send it. that's what a lot of therapists. would tell you oh really. yeah i actually have done. that and let me tell you it. actually works you'll start to. like forget about it but because you've gotten it. out it's a weird mind trick. i'm not saying like it's like some actual woohoo. [ __ ] it doesn't nothing actually changes yeah. except something about writing it. down walking through the whole part. of like expressing it as if you were gonna. export to that person it. even makes it like easier. on you become easier on that. person my therapist always tells me to. do that i never do it. do it but it's like i don't want to. write an essay you know. i'm not you don't write an essay you. write an email and you don't. send it you don't send it. i mean obviously you don't send it. back it seems a little risky writing an email. you don't put your name in the [ __ ] thing okay. but if you just by mistake. hit that one button dude. then you don't write it off. to mike linoche subject. later you're always late and then save it as here's why you're a [ __ ] one two three four five seconds exactly yeah well all right look i mean we we have more videos and we're not going to. stop yet but i do want to. say since i forgot to. do this i will be in atlanta wow. wow

and then we're done hey guys first. time caller long time. listener love the new show. today i'm going to. be using missed. connection lingo as a way to. describe this scenario also this is completely hypothetical. not saying this has ever happened. to me um so let's just say. a 24 year old male plumber. has been on this web. okay a hundred percent happened. yes okay we know that. yes also let me explain if you haven't. seen my podcast congratulations. i do a segment called. miss connections where i read. miss connections from craigslist. and i just go through. them and they're always about [ __ ] sex and they're trying to. um like what do you call. it they're trying to. not they you they like i don't know. why i guess they get flagged if they talk. about like blow jobs so. they'll be like i want to. eat your corn on the cob. no yeah it's really funny. wow people are so [ __ ] i know crazy. and weird man they'll be like mexican. chub what is that like a fat. mexican i want a fat mexican. to come over to. my house and clean my pipes. it'd be like mexican chub. come clean my pipes. that sounds like a way. to get real crossed. up oh well somebody comes to. your door with plumbing equipment. they should if yeah well not just go. to a plumber i guess. if you were gonna true. yeah all right so go. ahead hey guys first. time caller long time. listener love the new show. today i'm going to. be using missed. connection lingo as a way to. describe this scenario also this is completely hypothetical. not saying this has ever happened. to me so let's just say a 24. year old male plumber. has been on this website. where he is looking for prospective female. clients uh also interested. in plumbing and pipe cleaning he's been messaging. this one female client back. and forth and she finally invites him. back to her place. and they start to. do some plumbing and during the pipe. cleaning the male plumber's part. or tool stops performing or malfunctions. what would you recommend. the male plumber to. do in this scenario. what could he say to. the female client in order. to assure her that it's not. her fault thank you looking. forward to what you guys. have to say uh and yes i recorded this in a bomb. shelter dude how weird is that that that was the [ __ ] thing that i said and then he did that very weird. i'm psychic dude are you. know what it is i'm great. you know obviously it's like the funniest. version of it or the hackiest which is why. we both came like a professional. comedian i am and that's the one i went now. you guys are hacked. he's a plumber you're right. you are happy no. so all right so he is obviously. talking about himself the answer. is make a [ __ ] joke. about it no you go. like this it's your fault. do a spin move and [ __ ] move he just said how do i make sure that to. tell her that it's not. her fault it is okay. no it's not i'm kidding. it's not dude i'm joking. we do jokes here um yeah. well i mean yeah make a [ __ ] joke. about it dude. make a joke about what you could. say what this is for real. because it's happened to. me what if you say you know. this is true this is well for me. it's been true in my life. i'm 42 it's happened but i'm like you know. uh i i actually like you and i'm like it's not that. i'm nervous but like i i want. you to like me. and i want to. make sure that everything. is cool and that's why. was that true yes for me. oh well if it was true. i like the girl the first time. a lot of the times it's like um i don't i'm not fully you. know what i mean it's like you're ripped. up a little in your head. you mean i guess like a little i mean. like i guess so butterflies. i don't feel nervous but it's like it's like but it's a nervous. system thing yes yes but the thing. is i'm not a [ __ ] dude. oh and if you're thinking that that's not true. at all okay right. again thank you one. more time relax yeah but i would say that. that's a and i have said that. to the girl that's good actually. because it's it's honest. and endearing and it makes it clear. which checks this box which this guy's concerned with. which is actually very thoughtful he wants. to make sure that the woman. knows it's not her fault. right or not her. not fault but like not. because he's not attracted to. her let's say uh but uh so yeah there's there's that but i think there's also when i say make a joke. i don't mean like about her obviously. like a joke about like a selfdeprecating joke. about yourself about something faulty. hardware [ __ ] whatever the [ __ ] but uh yeah dude it's so [ __ ] obvious the thing the things not to not. do are so [ __ ] obvious yeah you know what i mean like you don't want to. [ __ ] make anything that's even remotely possibly misconstrued. as you were blaming her. that would be sayonara. to you for the rest. of your [ __ ] time on earth with this particular woman. yeah or you could be like some guys. like some guys like uh but you remember in that. movie um the one with the [ __ ] ben stiller and the guy who goes with my baseball. and cameron diaz oh something about mary. yeah um he jerks off. before he goes on a date. right yeah yeah yeah you know. you could just say you did. that oh but that see that. here's something sometimes there. are dire situations. where you really want to. save someone's feelings where the only thing. you can think of in the moment. is to lie. yeah i don't think that you have to. do that in this situation. because true the truth is not. only endearing but uh also the truth and the truth is always a little easier or a lot easier because you don't have to. remember the thing you [ __ ] like oh man but then it's like [ __ ] if it happens the next time dude then you're in your head you know what i mean right but then at least it would be like a the last the previous case would be true and then that would be like a rolling truth. i guess like it's just perpetuating itself. and then it becomes its thing. i get what you're saying. about getting in your head. but you don't want to. lie yeah yeah yeah or you could maybe you're gay. you think he's gay no. i mean he might be just be like you know. what i haven't decided if i'm into. dudes yet or not but this is really good. though thank you sorry we'll see you next time. that would be the worst. thing to say i'm. gonna [ __ ] a guy next and then when i come back. to you we'll see what. happens yeah yeah i mean that's an option. i wouldn't recommend it. but you could go that way. um yeah tell her what i said. dude that's good because that's probably how you feel i'm a psychiatrist. oh okay uh if that's the truth. then definitely do what he said. because that's good yeah. um all right cool well. that was good that was great. um that's it we'll wrap. it up we did like eight. videos uh chrisleya dot com for tickets. i got i got a bunch of cities coming. up i read them. about 10 minutes ago. uh so go get your tickets. now still some seats. available and uh and that's it. did we have anything oh did you pull up the the the [ __ ] home screen or no if you have a if you have a uh a question go to. uh what do you call. it um what is it. anthony do you know it. did you ask matt. and chris oh um yeah send in a video. uh the link is in the description. below or go to. watchlifeline dot com and another thing. that we like doing is looking at the uh. comments and seeing what advice. you have for everybody. so go ahead and drop your advice. for the people because they're also reading it. i heard it was [ __ ] going. off in the comments on our last episode. oh really yeah yeah someone wrote to. me someone someone who had her. we we used her video. and her advice and she wrote me. and was like so many people in the [ __ ] comments were like yeah so that's good because they read. that stuff too so you could be like if you're watching yeah. right you know don't want to. get over inundated with that [ __ ] though there's nothing worse than too much. advice like imagine somebody giving you like a hundred people. giving you advice and they're all different. yeah you'll be overwhelmed i guess. so yeah you're right. well don't make it sound like you disagree. with me i mean i'm right. about a lot of stuff. dude oh okay uh all right. you guys thanks for watching um chrisley dot com. for tickets and uh that's it. we love you thank you. you guys are good i love. you all [music] hello. hello
