microwave. that [ __ ] pops put it on a pan and it pops you put it dude popcorn. is so good it's kind of like the and why. don't we only eat it. when we watch movies what's the deal. with that dude if i saw a dude. out in public. eating popcorn i would think he lost. his mind but it's so good that's on me. bro that's on me. that's how good it. is you should eat it. out in public. people eat chips people eat. pretzels the [ __ ] don't people eat popcorn. you know we'll be the [ __ ] sandwich shops if they if they give you sandwich. sandwiches and instead of [ __ ] chips they put a handful of popcorn on there if they did you'd think they lost our mind but that's so much better than chips you know what [ __ ] chips how about that i'm not talking about tortilla chips here's the deal here's the deal tortilla chips good all right if you [ __ ] double them up though and you know some mexican restaurants like to. get real fancy with their tortilla chips. don't if it ain't broke. don't fix it you know. what dude and all of a sudden were in the podcasts. i had no game plan. and all of a sudden were smooth. sailing into the podcast we're on our way up. the planes like this and we're putting our [ __ ] chairs back. and we're relaxing when you put your chair. back by the way right. when the [ __ ] wheels come. up because you know. they can't do [ __ ] cuz you know they can't get up. and do [ __ ] i [ __ ] put it up as we're taking off and if i can see the [ __ ] person because you know sometimes they face you the stewardess or the stewart they face you i i look in their eyes as were as were drive as we're not at all off yet and i go and i look in their eyes while i move back. because they can't do [ __ ] and guess what that. three inches of glorious kickback. may give me won't. do [ __ ] if the plane can't do [ __ ] if we're gonna crash we're gonna crash alright tortilla chips are good period. when people look in my eyes. and tell me that the dark. blue tortilla chips are better. than the beige tortilla chips i want. to [ __ ] piss all over and leave it on my [ __ ] and thighs when when they're how about when they're multicolored multicolored like when they're multicolored when they bring the [ __ ] red and blue and like it like we're in a [ __ ] mcdonald's commercial oh [ __ ] off i want them all beige i'm racist when it comes to tortilla chips i want a baby [ __ ] i want them all looking like donald trump that's how i want them i don't want a red one i don't want a [ __ ] blue one they're normal and that's it and when you double them up dude when you fry them up and they stick together go [ __ ] yourself people try to. act like ooh i like them no you don't you like it. because you think you're a bored. [ __ ] that's what it is you know what i get every time i go to. a sandwich shop a goddamn turkey sandwich. that's what i do that's what i do. cuz i know it's what i like when you're the kind of person. i had another x every time. we'd go she knew what. she liked but she'd look at the menu. like it was a goddamn jk rowling's book. is that who the author. is i always get her mixed. up with jk simmons hey don't initialize your [ __ ] goddamn name by the way. what's your name if your name's john. knowles or whatever the [ __ ] it is that is john. knowles it's not jk what's your name just kidding. just kidding rowling's. just kidding simmons you know. here's the deal you're bored. with your life if you think the [ __ ] double fried tortilla strips are and most of the population thinks that the double fried.
