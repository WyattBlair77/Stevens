 i gotta show you guys. so okay so here's what happened. so i was watching my son. play and i was in one. of these moments where i caught myself. just kind of watching him. play and not only did my heart. feel full my heart just felt like it. ate brunch and breakfast do you know. what i mean just full of [ __ ] like my heart. got up early had breakfast. and it was like you know what i'll meet the friends. for brunch too and ate brunch. too and just it felt. like it was swelling. you understand like i had eggs in there. and then i all also had a little bit of a [ __ ] i had some athletes buried on a salad. you know and it was just swell as [ __ ] i felt love and the cool. thing about it was sometimes. you feel love when you're looking. at either your partner. or your mom and your dad. or your son or your daughter. whoever the [ __ ] it is and then sometimes you feel love and you think about how you feel the love right you process it you realize wow i'm a human or as neil degrasse. tyson would say your billions. of dust particles billions. and billions of dust particles. and billions of years. it took billions of years. to to say to. do to make you and that's how you exist. on these billions of years. when wolves became dogs. and dogs games and then billions of billions. and billions and billions of years. billions of particles of dust and particles. um and and i felt human as [ __ ] i felt so. human i felt jackson human. but i felt human okay. and i was looking at my son. and i was like wow we're all billions. of specks of dust and my heart. seems full of billions i went to. brunch and i ate billions of billions. of eggs and then i went to. and then i had breakfast before. and i realized i had billions. and billions billions of sundried tomatoes and billions. and billions of eggs but i had billions. and billions of particles of. love and um and i was looking at him. and i realized that not only did i feel that. way but i was laying and i was comfortable as [ __ ] and i was relaxed for the first time. in a very long time. i you know what i was. i was do you understand. it's like when those chicks. think they're [ __ ] creative. by saying like i'm human being right. like it's like saying i'm not business. man i'm a businessman i'm not a human. being i'm a human being and um i fought it. i'm lactose and um so i was just being i was a human. being and i realized i was smiling. and the interesting thing about that. was it was a i didn't know i was smiling. you know sometimes hey get together for a picture and you just pose. and you're like here comes. a smile or you're having a good. time and you're like [ __ ] is a good time. and you're laughing and you're like wow. i'm laughing real. hard this is awesome but every now and then it doesn't happen. often you have a smile and you actually. check in with your body. right you check in like it's the dmv. you just go to. the front desk in your head. and you're like hey i'm smiling. aren't i and the rest of your body is like yup. so i'm like what an interesting. thing i don't normally feel this. way or check in with my body. and experience this in this. way and i'm holding my phone. as i do this. so i'm like you know what i could. do i could easily just swipe my phone. to the side and have the picture the camera. come up which a lot. of people don't know kristen doesn't know. wifey she has no idea you can do this. and i tell her this all the time. and i hand her my phone. and i say take a picture of me. and my son and she says what's your code. and i say you don't need a code. just swipe it to. the side and she says you do it. and then i got to. do it and by then. i'm pissed off and the moment's over. so i know this and since i'm already checked. in and i'm smiling and i realize it's a genuine. smile and i've never really seen. myself give a genuine smile coupled. with the information that i could just slide. this camera over and it's already. on selfie mode because your boy he's conceded. and he takes lots of selfies so i slide. it to the side. and i got this and i also know guess what i also know. you can take a picture by. just pressing the side button on your iphone. so you don't have to. guess where the button is in the [ __ ] thing so i'm not [ __ ] so i'm just here i slide it. over and i take a picture in selfie. mode by using the side of the button to. see what i look like with a pure 100. percent genuine smile this is not a joke. at all at all this is not a joke. but this is the picture. of me 100 genuinely dripping. with purity smiling it. looks like i'm daniel daylewis. in my left foot it. looks like i can't move. my body at all except for my left. foot and the only thing i can say. that is like intelligible is like oatmeal like that. you know what i mean. like that's what i want dude. i don't know how i look so [ __ ] up and i'm not making i'm not like doing this. this isn't a joke. my smile looks so [ __ ] bad if my kid were to. have looked at me. like even though i was looking at him. if he had looked at me. it would have just he would have been like what. the [ __ ] we got to. get dad to. the hospital i'm trying to. find this picture right. now so i could send it to. everybody in the just [ __ ] insane uh it's so bad i'm looking at i'm trying to. describe it to the people who listen. um i look like i'm like you know. what i look like actually i look like i'm thinking i look. like i'm you know what i'm i look. like i look like a racist. guy that's watching the race. he hates win a bunch. of money at poker and i'm just like these [ __ ] persians like that's how i that's how i look this. [ __ ] that's my smile that's my genuine smile watching my son. play and be happy dude. i i looked at the phone. i was like oh my god dude. i [ __ ] don't get it. i don't get it so i got to. get a new smile one. time when i was younger. my mom said you should walk. different oh it hurt. me to my core. she said you need a cool. walk oh but that hurt. me to my core. you should walk different i said why. she said i don't know. you know how some guys walk. cool oh it hurt. me to my car. i was 16 how could you do. it mom you need a new. walk never forgot it think about it. too much my mom doesn't like the way. i walk that's bad it's bad. to say to. your son all good dude. you know what i need that. walk i need that [ __ ] beginning of the [ __ ] song [music] with my [ __ ] collar so high it's scraping ceilings
