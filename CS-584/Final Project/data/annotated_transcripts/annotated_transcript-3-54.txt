person. i saw when i was out whether i was at a mall. or turned a corner whatever. that i should be able. to see and know what he was going. to look like and of course i never did. it but i always tried. but voices i'm good dude. one guy guy one time a guy walked in a room. uh and i was at ccd communicate. commun communion and i was with my brother. and uh and he came in and i was like oh that

breath right like guys who are super. positive and do yoga if you don't have bad. breath something's seriously wrong with you. you're not doing it right. right you got to. have bad breath if you do. yoga and you're always positive. right so um so he comes up. and he's just like dude. i'm so happy to. be here man he's one. of these 55 year olds one. of these 50 year olds that talk. says dude a lot

you. guys that you'd like and i said oh. dude well we we saw your video. and your demo real it and you killed it it's amazing this is why we hired you i didn't tell him we hired him because of his face cuz you're obviously a wedding singer. and this is the guy. i want sing at my wedding. because of his face because of the aesthetic. of his face right. this guy goes move. over adam sandler with

is classic rock we play. the classics if that's cool. and i was like absolutely and he was like so you don't want anything. specific you don't want to. lead me in a certain direction and i was. like like nah dude. you do you is why we hired. you and that's something i believe in dude. it's something i believe in we had a wedding. planner and she said we were the easiest. couple that she ever [ __ ] worked with because you delegate right. we delegate my babies. we're all about delegation. that's why when you join. the cult and you share. ideas what do you do. dude everyone has a [ __ ] thing to. do in the toall grass or they're working. on the cabin they're putting out. wheats trimming some [ __ ] hanging up curtains. we got to live. baby but we're all about dting this. is delegating central right. and uh so we're so so i say you do you and he says all right. well if you change your mind. if you think anything i'm your guy. just come to. me and i go all right. cool and then he walks away. and i see my beautiful. bride so i say hey you know. what guy who has that. face why don't you ask. her she's she would know and i see him. and then kristen just goes like this.

that. but come correct i don't. hate that at all but this this. is a transaction let's get it. done in fact i don't hate it. i love it but i'm correct right. so i got this mircat looking at me. from

was just thinking about the world man. while i was going. to the bathroom you know. sometimes i like talking about news. on this on this. podcast you know i like doing a little bit i always kind of try. and do a little bit of stuff. that happen to. me and then also like some news. and [ __ ] and i do like doing misconnections. and stuff but like i don't like talking. like politics and [ __ ] and so much of the [ __ ] that's happened lately is politics. like ukraine and the [ __ ] kids dying on with the with the gun. control and all that [ __ ] and like i don't want to. talk about that [ __ ] you know you come here for real issues you know you come here for the hardhitting [ __ ] like what pants to. wear and how it feels when somebody is waiting for the outside of a [ __ ] zucchini pasta place and um that's why we say [ __ ] npr you know so like every now and then there's a political thing that happens that i got to. talk about and this week it's biden. f falling off of the bicycle. dude this is the whole thing. i always said when i was a kid. i said there should be one uh more uh rule on having your driver's. license you should and this has nothing to. do with the biden thing. but it kind of does. in at the end of it. you have to. be able to. catch a ball that's it. if someone throws you a ball. and they can underhand it but you have to. be able to. catch it if you can't. catch it you can't operate a car. you can't operate a bicycle. you just can't you got to. stop doing that right okay and what this. does is it weeds. out the people who are going to. [ __ ] kill people by mistake it weeds out people that are going to. crash in you it weeds. out people that are going to. [ __ ] drive off a cliff. for by a mistake they're going. to be oper opa in a forklift and spear. somebody right this is the thing. after 60 there has to. be a universal test across. the whole planet and it's to. throw a ball test it's. to throw me a ball test. you got to stand. there and you got to. somebody's going to be you know. five feet away from you. and they throw your ball. you get two chances. if you can't catch them ball. two times that's it you got to. walk everywhere or be a passenger and you can't operate heavy machinery. joe biden there's no way. this [ __ ] would pass. this pass the ball. test so he shouldn't. be on a bicycle. this guy fell harder than dogecoin. this guy d it let's watch him. i got it on instagramit not moving. at all so nervous. can't get his foot out. of the pedal dude. a [ __ ] when you're coasting and you're not moving just like this [ __ ] with the helmet has to. do it cuz he's president. needs to be a [ __ ] role model. [ __ ] with the helmet now. all good you're 80. get off the bike not. like that get off the bike. don't ever get on the bike. promoting health promoting safety.
