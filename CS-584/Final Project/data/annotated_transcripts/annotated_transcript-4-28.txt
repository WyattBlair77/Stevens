wrong. and let me tell you why. because that's just why it's so great. blueberries that's why blueberries. are so great because the tasty ones come at you and explode. in your mouth while sometimes you get some bitter. ones and that's like a special treat it. makes the whole experience better. bye. sorry. guys my friends were having an argument what were the best. fruits and it's blueberry. and that's it. i don't want to. talk about it. you guys ready. or what dude. i have a white. claw we're just classing this. whole thing up. oh god all right. hold on. let me get my guys. hold on one second we're just setting up. you know. i honestly think bananas. are better. oh bananas don't even. enter the chat dude, bananas. don't enter the chat. i don't like any fruit. i don't like any fruit. with casing dude like pineapples and pineapples. are great but they lose. because it's like oh what's in here. and it's just pineapple not [ __ ]. cash they have a spiky [ __ ] thing. like it's [ __ ] but it keeps it. fresh. if anything it's like you're getting a fresh bite whereas the blueberries. are already kind of sitting out. in the air just like picking up. particles and bacteria and. stuff. but that's what all food. does anyway right. i don't know. yeah. well what. i'm saying is that the highlight of a banana is that it's in the casing. the highlight of a banana. yeah. if that's that's a highlight the highlight should be how it tastes. and it's a really good. food like if i'm really hungry. in the middle of the night. it's a good food. for that, good food in the morning, it's healthy.
