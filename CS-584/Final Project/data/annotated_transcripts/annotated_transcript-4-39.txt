[ __ ] me up enough. to where i couldn't be. at a party and listen. to some dude. talk about his lawn. you know and i remember my exgirlfriend one of the reasons. we broke up she said. hey do you want to. go to lunch with me. and my friend and i said uh nah. and she was like well why. not and i said i don't know. it's just your [ __ ] you go and she was like well i would want to. go have lunch with you and your friends and i said [ __ ] no [ __ ] my friends are will sasso and [ __ ] david off you know and i was joking but i was serious too and i used that as an excuse to. compartmentalize like my [ __ ] behavior and um i realize now that it wasn't that it was i i didn't feel good just being just being i always felt like there needed to. be some sort of safety. or there needed to. be that high octane [ __ ] mach 11. lifestyle and through this past year. of sobriety i've just realized i'm trying and it's a it's a work in progress. but um and i hope this helps people but like i'm trying to. be i try to. find that middle i want to. get to that middle and be okay. with that middle like i i was talking to. my therapist once and i think i've talked about it. on my podcast before about. how you know um i always felt like i had to. do something to. make people like me when the truth. is i just like calvin. because he's just here you know. and um i don't know you don't have to. do something you know. what i'm saying you don't have to. walk into. a room and be something you can just be and being comfortable. in that being is is really hard. for me and um i don't know. i hope what i'm saying is. is i i hope it i hope it. helps people and um you know all the shame. and the guilt and [ __ ] that uh that comes with all of that. um if you if you feel it too because you have your uh demons or whatever the [ __ ] um i uh i know it's a struggle so you can do it and anyway i just figured i should talk about that because it's been a year uh i guess now we can talk about [ __ ] uh you know dumb [ __ ] like we do on this podcast but uh i i didn't even mean to. start out like that and i didn't even know if i was gonna talk about it. but i did and so now we can talk about other things. uh like uh [ __ ] buzzfeed articles and [ __ ] oh actually you know what i [ __ ] was uh reading this article here oh wait let's talk about this fight man i watched the fight the floyd mayweather fight with logan paul um logan won before the fight it just you win man you did it you got there also that dude is like you know it's it's so cool to. watch him become a man. because he was a kid. you know we people just expect so much. of [ __ ] you know this kid filmed a video in in a forest and i know this is old news. now and nobody even talks about it. anymore and and and and you know not even that we should or we shouldn't but like it. it's it's so cool to. see what he's become and he's so obviously learned. how to grow up. and be a man. and um you know after the fight. when he was just like man. i hate being a dick. this is just cool. to be here and it was just cool. to to see that um and uh and it was wild. he went eight rounds with. [ __ ] floyd mayweather i mean of course there was a size difference i mean i'm sure if logan went up against what's that guy dante dante wilder or is it dante deonte i mean whatever it is you know i'm it's like i'm just a white guy but like it's either dante deontay or devonte dude black people will just like add one letter you know like a name will get or be around for like five years and i'll just be like i'll let's add a v you know and you're like krebs yeah my uncle's name was craig i'm kraev um you're like all right krebs because i saw a [ __ ] guy on was it the bachelor's name was his name was courtney and it was quartney ah courtney you know that's like an alien [ __ ] killed his parents and then dressed up as his parents and were like let's name him courtney no one it's it's regular name no one will know and then they just uh oh on the birth. certificate i don't know it. sounds like quarter quar courtney. and uh so yeah so anyway it was [ __ ] cool. to see i watched it. with my parents and um and uh you know my dad's always like who so who is the it. doesn't matter who the [ __ ] if somebody's under 50 my dad's like who is that it. doesn't matter it could be like [ __ ] ryan gosling. he's like yeah so i know and my dad's in the [ __ ] business dude. and he's just like no. i he was he was he the one. in and you're just like dad. you know who [ __ ] ryan phillippe. is you know yeah i think i i and then sometimes. yeah i know him because i worked with him. when he was five like it. was seth green he's like i know he did a chips ahoy commercial. with him or some [ __ ] um and so he's like so this guy's a boxer now. and i'm just like yeah and we did. it and the [ __ ] my mom was saying during the fight just like oh oh when when see oh he needs to. punch him more like yeah no [ __ ] you know he's only landing. like 10 percent imagine my mom. as a boxing announcer oh. look at him he's so much. bigger he's so much. bigger why isn't there. a weight difference there's a different club these are different. classes right this is my mom. during the this is the [ __ ] these are the things that she was [ __ ] saying oh we missed. him like just [ __ ] oh we missed. him we're all watching oh. he's got no skills that's what that's what. she said oh my favorite. one was oh no don't do. below the belt that's who you need to. announce boxing matches because boxing is. look let me just say logan. paul went [ __ ] eight rounds with. the greatest boxer alive boxing is. done do you know what i mean. floyd needed to. knock that [ __ ] out. in two rounds otherwise. boxing is they're gonna offer why. the [ __ ] oh i know he's a boxer now. and he's a talented. athlete logan but he's trying to. shed his youtube image it's like. dude youtube a youtuber went. eight rounds with [ __ ] floyd mayweather that's it. boxing is done turn on. the ufc do you understand. what i'm saying it's like [ __ ] oh no don't do below the belt my mom talks to.

jimmy this. one yeah he seemed like such a [ __ ] regular guy so buzzfeed how guys are sharing men's secrets and they're surprisingly really hilarious. and wholesome here we go. last week i wrote a post. about guys sharing men's secrets. well our buzzfeed commenters came through. with some additional examples. of men's secrets and they're also pretty. entertaining to read all right. here's what they said number. one losing your hair is extremely distressing. it makes you feel unattractive old. and insecure not everyone has the face. head to shave off remaining. hair get the [ __ ] out of here. seriously guys don't like to. go bald come on dude you've got to. be joking hey dude. you're going bald hey man. you're losing your hair i'm not that's a [ __ ] crazy. crazy secret did you guys know. that i mean i know. it's on buzzfeed and they broke. this news but i wanted to. put it on a platform. also to let you know that. it's coming from crystalia guys don't want. to go bald. here's another one adjusting the bits. oh i i don't like when just say balls. it's just like when somebody says call women. think it's funny oh the twins. are talking about their boobs the twins. are just they're not twins they're all. twins twins are twins because some people are twins. if everyone's twins they're not twins. so you can't call your boobs. twins because they all look similar. if they're the both of them. always look similar it. makes sense if you [ __ ] think about it and i'm not explaining it further adjusting the bits. is second nature to. men and it isn't something we even do. consciously for the most part true. all it takes is accidentally sitting on your balls. once and you will do anything. to ensure it doesn't happen. again okay sure so please. don't overreact if a guy adjusts. his junk he probably needed it. and it probably didn't even. and he probably didn't even. realize he was doing it. i mean okay okay sure you know. secret no sure though. how about this one. number three i love cuddling. next to my wife as much as she loves. doing it to. me it's the feeling of being wanted. and protected that is just amazing. what the [ __ ] [ __ ] dude dude hey sh ah
