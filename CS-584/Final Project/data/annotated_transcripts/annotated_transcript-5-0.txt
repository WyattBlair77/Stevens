anything like things okay let's do some questions bro we haven't done this in a while let's do some questions oh interesting on episode 36 is by wade not 9 8 1 0 on episode 36 you answered a twitter question about wearing sunglasses indoors and said it was terrible did you change your mind or did your future just get so bright. that it became a health hazard. and you had to. so i understand mm futures too. bright future so bright. so ya wear sunglasses indoors cuz i'm a future. but here's the deal man. you can kind of do anything. as long as your attitude. is like [ __ ] [ __ ] you you know i'm saying like i was thinking about this the other day if you wear tevas or birkenstocks or doc martens like my point is if you wear some real corny [ __ ] [ __ ] okay and if you're wearing it because you're not thinking about what you're wearing and you're just like oh someone gave me those or i'll wear them or okay cool i'll put them on because they're convenient or they're comfortable then you're a [ __ ] dork but if you legit think whoa tvs are the [ __ ] and you're like i know they're not in fashion but [ __ ] y'all because i think they're the [ __ ] then more power to. you most guys who wear sunglasses. at night or indoors they're wearing them. because they're insecure and they want. to show you how cool they are but if you actually. are like [ __ ] y'all i'm gonna wear these indoors because i'm a [ __ ] [ __ ] then dude that's some serious jeremy renner [ __ ] if your word a long coat in the desert just because someone made you think it's a good idea then straight up but if you're wearing it because you think long coats are the [ __ ] and short coats can go suck dicks then honestly so there's no mind changing babies now that doesn't mean that that it doesn't change his mind daddy changes his mind cuz changing your mind is all about growth. and the world changes. so you have to. when people are like [ __ ] change that's crazy. to me for life to. continue to. rip you have to. keep changing we grow every cell in your body. wasn't in your body. about ten years ago. they're all new cells and i think that that's true. probably because neal brennan told me. so anyway yeah that's some real.

[ __ ] quoteunquote tell it like it is and that's becoming really increasingly. annoying like any reaction to. something that's so drastic. is also annoying so like there's this thing where it's like some some comedians really good. at it like bill. burr chris rock dave chappelle they do the telling it like it is at the it meets the funniness but some comedians are like bro i just got to. keep it real and tell it like it. is and they do it. so hard that they're not being funny. as well like that should never be the forefront i've been thinking about this. man so many comedians are trying. to tell it like it is. that it isn't being funny. and then there's enough people in the world. that will like you no. matter what if you have some sort of fan. base because there's [ __ ] 7 billion people out. there that some people will just be like a man. props to you for keeping it. real no not props to. that person for keeping it. real stop keeping it real be funny. i don't want to. keep it real even though you know daddy's got to. keep it real because it's a comedy. but really be funny that's why. i always say we're down for a silly goose time. in that set man i don't want. you to mistake me. for one of those [ __ ] that's always telling it like it is bro. keep in mind always underlying [ __ ] you [ __ ] but also on stage silly goose time [ __ ] you gotta mix the [ __ ] with the because if you just have that then you won't have enough but what we're really looking for is you know what i'm saying does it make sense for hearing. it for a hearing. aid for an audio aid is that make sense to. you it's not enough to. just keep but we'll be funny. and that's all i have to. say about that and i still can't believe that. [ __ ] six people were in the netherlands and a basement for nine years. and the seal i think i've been thinking about ever. since i've been talking about it. this podcast and it's all good. but dude let me also say something. else to you guys i want. to thank you for listening. to this every week. and being and supporting me and coming out. to the shows it's just [ __ ] awesome. and it's really cool to. be able to. share this podcast with you and it's also really cool too what. do you call it be. able to do what i do. and i'm glad i get to. make you laugh and i mean that man. so look download the cash app for free on the app store or google google play market and you could text me at the number i told you go to. my instagram and just click the text. button and you get to. get the merch at chris. d'elia calm subscribe to the youtube. channel rate review the show and tweet me by using. the hand between me whatever. video podcast go up a day. after the audio podcast and very cool. anyway thanks for coming to. see me san diego i'll be. there in a little bit and you guys. are awesome thanks guys i'll talk. to you later [music].
