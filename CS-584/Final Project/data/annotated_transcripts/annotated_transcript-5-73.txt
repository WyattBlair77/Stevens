[ __ ] people who want to. learn english and it's cool. and he's there all day. and it's you know it's it's almost like he should rent out. space super nice guy um but he says hi. to everybody that comes into. the coffee shop because he knows everybody. and he knows me and i know. him of course and i saw him. today and it was like [ __ ] 11:00. a.m. and uh you know know. he knows people that come in and when he comes. in he's he's one of those guys. that just talks so loud to. people there's like there's like 23. people in the coffee shop. and he'll just be like hey how's your day. going and and and this girl's. like oh you know pretty. good you eating a banana. she's like yep and he's like she's like i'm trying. to talk with my mouthful but oh yeah and everyone everyone hears. what's up with these loud. talkers dude talk quieter everyone. can hear everyone can [ __ ] hear we can all hear we got ears. um but uh so i'm like i got to. leave and i'm trying to. not make eye contact with him because i don't really have much. time and i don't want to. [ __ ] so i'm i walk over to. the trash can and throw something. away and he says hey man. i say oh what's going. on and i talk quieter when someone talks. loud to me i do. it quieter so cu. i want them to. know how goddamn loud they're talking it's like the scene. from [ __ ] heat when aluo was like oh boy oh boy oh we're going to. take guns oh boy. and robert d was just like you know what i mean. and alpacino is like [ __ ] i'm killing. it oh boy i'm killing. it i'm killing it. and then robert nero's like no but really i'm killing. it you really realize what a [ __ ] ass la pino's being when [ __ ] robert doo comes in and does the right so i'm [ __ ] doing the robert dair to. his alucino and he's just like um uh so he says uh how's the country. because you know he knows i tour. and [ __ ] which and i'm and in my head i almost say if it was a normal guy that talk not loud i'd be like oh actually i was out of out. of the country for about 3. weeks i was in australia. but i don't want to. so i just say oh it's good. oh [ __ ] man it's good and he says oh oh great and then i leave and it's embarrassing cuz like now everybody knows in there that i i'm all around the country and they know my business and i don't really care if people know my business at the coffee shop i don't give a [ __ ] but it's just like is what are we doing a play you know what i mean what are we doing a [ __ ] play and everyone's an audience member hey man oh those shoes look comfortable he'll be like that oh yeah they are yeah what are they and now i got to. [ __ ] tell everybody oh they're they're ultra boosts you know yada yada and now everybody knows i [ __ ] you know what i mean ordered ultra boosts online or some [ __ ] that's just embarrassing i i get i get like here's the thing i um i i i never get like embarrassed really because i always said like when you bomb in front of like 400 people which i've done before um like that's the worst part of embarrassment that that's like there's nothing more embarrassing than that like literally you can walk into. a classroom in high school. with your dick out by. mistake and you even if you. have a little [ __ ] penis. that has a little bit. of discoloration on it it's less. embarrassing than [ __ ] bombing in front of 400. people so i've done that. that's the scariest thing what oh so what's what. what's less what what now i'm going. to talk to. a girl and fail. who gives a flying. [ __ ] [ __ ] i've bombed in front of 400 people at the irvine improv. after sadiki fuller went on. and murdered so um so i i [ __ ] went on and uh so i didn't go. on so so i getem i i i don't get embarrassed. i don't get embarrassed and i don't get nervous. really because it's hard. for comedians to get nervous. check sidiki fuller out. by the way he's funny he's a [ __ ] great guy um but uh but uh there's a few times i do get a little weird when i have a i have to. have a loud conversation. with somebody and there's other people around. um and but here's another thing. that i i i actually wrote this. down because i i don't know about this. um uh here look so i feel like i just got over. this by the way i used to. feel like uh some sometimes i feel [ __ ] embarrassed. and like a [ __ ] at restaurants. and i wonder if you guys feel this. way too or if this. is just a me thing when i'm when i have to. order food i i i feel [ __ ] like a [ __ ] not not like a a mean [ __ ] like a [ __ ] like insecure [ __ ] when i when i when by the way whenever i say [ __ ] i mean insecure i don't mean like you know um but uh i feel like a [ __ ] whenever i have to. order a food from a restaurant. because and this is so weird. because especially if it's like a [ __ ] rootin toot and cob salad. because they made it first of all i won't say. that if i'm at the [ __ ] denny's and it says moon's over my hammy and that's what i want. i grab the menu. and i look at the waiter. and i say that's what i want. and i and and if if there's no picture i say this. and i and they have to. read it cuz i'm not [ __ ] going to. your establishment and saying moons over my hamy okay. i'll say it here to. let you know that we don't stand. for that in the congratulations. cult but dude you're going. to you're going to. make me just cuz i'm hungry. sit down at your restaurant. and say some cute [ __ ] like moons over my hamy uhuh dude. i ain't saying it now i hate. to say it like this. but dude i ain't saying. it dude i ain't saying. it i'm no [ __ ] cuda dude you're not getting me all lost up. in the sauce dude. no [ __ ] way okay so um oh by the way not ordering. moons over miami cuz don't want cancer. okay the reasons why because i don't want a heart attack. oh and they come in it. for sure no doubt and at denny's. they [ __ ] jerk off in the food. i you're telling me that. nobody's ever jerked off and [ __ ] come in the food. at denny's [ __ ] short order chefs do it all the time and you know they do hey uh want to. f by the way don't ever send. some [ __ ] back on a short order. chef there's no [ __ ] way they spit and come in it no doubt. there's no [ __ ] doubt if you're at a nice classy. restaurant cool but if you're at some [ __ ] thing like the uh the greenwich [ __ ] diner. or something in new in new york. they'll come in your [ __ ] on your plate. no doubt um yeah i never send food. back when it looks like a janky ass. place but uh i feel like a [ __ ] when i have to. say especially i used to. i just got over this. at uh at the at sushi when i sit at the bar. and i'm alone and i'm like yeah. can i get two salmon sushi. i feel like a [ __ ] even saying it now i don't know why yeah can i get two two uh i would like to. get two orders of the salmon sushi. and i hate here's the thing. too man when you go get sushi. every time you order two orders of the salmon [ __ ] sushi or whatever they always say so that's a two piece or a two two order. two orders that's a four. yeah i know two comes. in the [ __ ] one two piece or two order. two order okay so and it's because of all these [ __ ] people that [ __ ] it up yeah let me get a two and then four come and then they're like oh i ordered two and you're like yeah but two come and two look at the [ __ ] menu they have pictures of the goddamn thing oh i just wanted two that's $8 how expensive is sushi you know what the [ __ ] fish is expensive man um but i do i feel like a [ __ ] when i ever have to. order some [ __ ] i don't really feel like a [ __ ] whenever i have to. order something on um um like a a cafe but uh i do when i when i when i have to. [ __ ] go at like a a like a a ni a little bit of nicer. restaurant i don't know what the [ __ ] that is dude. it's weird but anyway this guy was talking about talking louder. and [ __ ] um surround about um but god damn he was just talking loud what what is up. with that people that just [ __ ] talk loud. sometimes i straight up tell them. i say hey man. you're talking too loud bro. i'm right here it's all good. i try to. do it in a disarming. way you know um i was at this. [ __ ] other coffee shop the other day and i went to. go back out of the space. it was after they were closed. and i went to. go back out of the space. and i almost hit the [ __ ] chain. that they blocked the parking. lot off with which is like why. you know why wh what what. someone's going to park. there after hours who gives a [ __ ] who cares you're going to. put a chain across your parking. lot for for what oh cool. now in acura camp parked there. uhoh hey guys what if a [ __ ] acura parked there for 3. hours i'm [ __ ] annoyed with myself. right now talking about that. i don't if i if i was listening to. me right now the podcast. i'd turn it off at. this point but um no the uh and i almost hit it and i decided in my head in my fantasy. you ever do this. [ __ ] in my fantasy i hit it got mad because cu i was still there at the at the uh coffee shop so in my head they shouldn't have put the chain over there yet. because i was still in the establishment. and then because the other exit. didn't have the chain on. it and they wanted everyone to. leave that chain on that. that way but in my head. i hit it and my fantasy. and i parked this car right. where it was where i hit. it and walked back. in and i yelled at them. and i said i'm still in the [ __ ] parking lot why the [ __ ] would you put the chain on obviously my back. up and hit it what is up. with you [ __ ] and then i and then i like felt good that. in my fantasy i i i i stood up. for myself even though none of it. happened you know i did. a whole larry david episode. in my head and even though. it didn't happen i felt vindicated i drove. home like yeah that'll [ __ ] teach them didn't happen. you you guys do that [ __ ] too i know you do how [ __ ] crazy is that the [ __ ] you think of you ever think of [ __ ] crazy [ __ ] like that and then you're like oh god this is [ __ ] up like i'll f i'll straight up think sometimes i'm hanging out with somebody and i'll think what happens if i just stabed them up their [ __ ] neck what would happen it would be all [ __ ] goofy and real you know just like they'd make that noise you know and then they'd fall down dead and i'd be a [ __ ] criminal i'd be a [ __ ] criminal and then i'd have to. run or turn myself in if i just [ __ ] found a sharp fence and then went and just [ __ ] talk about gargle gargle dude and then just bleeding all over their [ __ ] mimo shirt or sometimes i [ __ ] i mean i here's the thing i think about that [ __ ] i do i don't care and and and and i think a lot of you guys do too one time i was hanging out at [ __ ] uh some mexican restaurant with my friend morgan daki dude i was always the friends with the [ __ ] weirdest kids man when i was in high school my mom would be like how come you can't hang out with people who have parents i can hang out with morgan daki who was just japanese the only [ __ ] japanese kid by the way the only asian kid in my [ __ ] high school that got d all asians got a pluses they got new letters whatever is above the a zap they got the letter zap that was that's before a that's how good they were and i was friends with the only [ __ ] asian guy that got d's morgan doak and his mom will be like every time i call you say and i say hey is morgan there morgan okay co dude and and one time we watch we went over [ __ ] morgan's house and we watched faces of death on vhs dude remember that [ __ ] faces of death remember that [ __ ] thing where they would be like some in some of countries people eat live monkeys and they would put a [ __ ] monkey in a in a in a [ __ ] device and like the people who were at the place to eat would just bash the monkey's head in until it died and then eat the monkey brains and then some guy just it would just show people dying where could you get you you had to get it like a [ __ ] you couldn't get it at blockbuster obviously but it's called faces of death and it would have videos of real this before the internet and they'd have like uh it you you' have to get it at some place called like [ __ ] odyssey video you know or like extreme something and you'd be like do you have faces of death and they would always [ __ ] say no but we have traces of death there was a ripoff traces of death there was faces of death which is the one and then. they'd [ __ ] rip it they had traces of death. i how could you have [ __ ] trac dude. if there's a thing called faces of death. and it's popular how could you have a [ __ ] thing called. traces of death what a. [ __ ] dick all for the cash man so we would do it so so i would [ __ ] so one time i was at a mexican restaurant so anyway my mom couldn't be friends with a [ __ ] japanese lady who couldn't speak english obviously there was another kid mike whose dad was greek as [ __ ] dude i don't even remember michael's last name but his dad was greek as [ __ ] and one time i said oh mom there's my cuz we just moved from new jersey and i was like oh mom there's my friend michael and we were at the [ __ ] pick and save parking lot and and and i waved and my mom waved at michael and the dad was in the car and he was all russian and he was oh no he was russian and he was like hey hello k. and he almost [ __ ] hit the god damn poles. that they have for no. reason in the parking structures. why are there [ __ ] poles. for no reason sometimes in parking. structures just for us to. hit him and [ __ ] anyway he almost hit the thing and he had to. stop and my mom [ __ ] laughed so hard dude and then she told me. eater i'm going to. get sick oh hello. my son is nam michael. even though it's obviously mel but we moved to. south southern california. even though it is m he it is michael now. and uh so he almost [ __ ] crashed into. the yellow pole at. [ __ ] pick and save oh [ __ ] he's probably dead now you know it's [ __ ] 25. years later he's [ __ ] dead. you ever think about that. [ __ ] [ __ ] die you ever watch movies in the 80s. and somebody 60 in in a movie in the 80s. and you're like a that motherfucker's. dead now least didn't get stabbed. in the [ __ ] neck and just drop down [ __ ] dead as [ __ ] dead is a [ __ ] doorknob you hear that [ __ ] cracking my neck because it's real so um so anyway uh so morgan so anyway one time i was by the way man that's one of those names morgan it's like dude you male or female morgan you gna have a [ __ ] name you male or female you [ __ ] male or female dude pick to. name [ __ ] kent okay if your name is going to. be morgan if you think about naming. your kid as a guy. name him kent all right. if you're thinking about naming. a kid morgan as a girl. name her [ __ ] mary do you understand. kent or mary not morgan anyway. um so one time i took one of these fantasies. for real man i wanted to. do it i put a bunch of salt. in my [ __ ] hands in my hand and i said to. morgan oh man there's so many [ __ ] stories about morgan dude so i said hey man you want to. feel my ninja dust and he said what the [ __ ] is that i said he would always every time he said what the he would always run it. together what the [ __ ] is that and i'd say uh you want to. feel my ninja dust and he oh i don't know what the [ __ ] that is what the [ __ ] is that and i said well do you want it's yes or no dude if you don't want to. [ __ ] know feel my ninja dust then just say no and we'll drop it and we won't talk about the ninja just ever ever again. but he was too curious. see that's the thing man. curiosity will [ __ ] get you i said you either want. to know what it is or you don't. and he said well no you know. sure yeah his curiosity got the best. of him and i took the salt and i [ __ ] i threw it right at his face and it went in his eyes. and that was a shitty thing. to do and he goes like this. oh what the [ __ ] is it. oh the [ __ ] is it the [ __ ] is it what the [ __ ] is it he [ __ ] was waving his eyes and i and i was laughing dude i was laughing like a [ __ ] and i said it's salt man don't worry about it like what did he think it was dude [ __ ] cumin what do you think it was ninja dust oh the [ __ ] is it oh the [ __ ] is it oh the [ __ ] is it and then one time i i played soccer and we were on the same team dude we were [ __ ] horrible he was goie he was goalie and i was [ __ ] defense cuz obviously i wasn't offense cuz i [ __ ] sucked cuz soccer sucks. oh hey run around and never stop no. uh but it's soccer say yeah. hey by shin pads. no never would i [ __ ] ever do an ev event. where i had to block. my shins from getting. hurt se you so i knew about bicycle. kicks and i thought those things. were the [ __ ] [ __ ] dude bicycle kicks bro land. on your back and [ __ ] kick the ball. out of trouble that's got my name written all. over it dude i don't give a [ __ ] what i did in soccer i was going. to do bicycle. kicks that was going. to be my specialty bro. you know in video games. when you [ __ ] have to. make your team or whatever. or it's a race. car game and you're like well. this car is good at accelerating. but the traction is. shitty and it's so fast. but the [ __ ] uh the the the uh the the other thing is good or the [ __ ] wheels are great. or whatever the [ __ ] i always where people pick the [ __ ] uh one that's best at all of them the average one that's best cuz you can't get good at everything unless you're like on level 100 which is [ __ ] but you'd have to. get pick the one. that's like good at like [ __ ] accelerating or good. at like traction [ __ ] that. i didn't i didn't pick the. one that was at the best. at you know average the best. i picked the one. that always had one that was boners. good at something like the acceleration. and then i just [ __ ] kill it in the acceleration. and then lose in the long. run and then they say this game. sucks so uh [ __ ] i don't know what i was talking about what oh yeah so the [ __ ] bicycle i was like dude i'm going to. be horrible at defense. offense st stamina and everything. but bicycle kicks were going. to be my [ __ ] so i was like whenever i see a ball coming high i'm going. upside the [ __ ] down and bicycle. kicking it out of trouble. okay now i play defense. all right so sure enough. games in this is into. the season i remember we were the green. team ao soccer morgan was the only other guy that i knew on the team. and he was and he was the goalie. so it was me and [ __ ] morgan doak chilling. in the defense all. the time getting scored on okay. now we weren't a very good team. and the reason why is because me and morgan doizaki. were on it if you got two of us. on your team it's probably going. to be bad okay. unless you got [ __ ] p on it too but here comes the ball. high and i and and it's and i'm and i'm and it and and it's coming. and i don't want it. to get i don't want to. get scored on even though. i secretly don't give a a [ __ ] but not secretly also the coach. knew but because that's why i i i [ __ ] was defense he had to. put me in so the ball. came high and here it. comes my chance to [ __ ] bicycle. kick it so here. daddy goes [ __ ] upside down and i'm going to. go kick it and i connect and morgan's. there too and he's like well i'll just grab it. he's like no no. no chris what the [ __ ] you doing what the [ __ ] you doing and i kicked it and sure enough by mistake i [ __ ] kicked it right into. our goal no no christoph what the f. you doing what the [ __ ] you doing no. no no no no what the fck. you doing and we [ __ ] and i scored. on our team and the other team. got the point and i don't give a [ __ ] and i didn't give a [ __ ] then either i went ah [ __ ] oh what the fck you doing no chris no damn dude we're we're looking at morgan do right now he looks like a stud dude he turned into. a stud oh is that his sister. or his mom oh that's his mom. wow oh man of course they got pictures.

look like a bro while you're working. you need to. look cool this is what it says. i believe that fitness in itself. can be viewed the same. as that of religion first. of all it's so annoying. that he says that of religion. like we like just talk the way. you talk why do people got to. be dramatic they think they got something. to say i believe that fitness. in itself like you could just say i believe i think fitness. is like religion right. why does this [ __ ] guy say i believe that. fitness in itself can be viewed the same as that of religion he's never said a sentence like this before in his life but he's writing it like that because he thinks he's got a platform and you know what he does which is annoying now granted he's probably only got how many followers he's got seven oh not even 700 followers but it's like dude if you were talking in a room with 700 people that's a lot of people like religion now here comes the awful analogies like religion it can be depicted in both a positive and negative light i mean i guess you know who really thinks of working out as negative nobody therefore strong analogy already those that don't understand it often mock or disregard it entirely who [ __ ] disregards working out like i understand if you don't want to. do it but who's like nah. nobody should nobody's nah some feel they need. it but are not ready. to fully commit the time. okay both communities in a way. have saved people from depression suicide. drug alcohol addictions etc sure yet that often goes unnoticed okay i guess. you're not really go unnoticed now. the
