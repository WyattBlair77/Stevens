[ __ ] left and right. like because i had a club or the club. the promoter was like hey man. we set you up some stuff. i was gonna go to. like the animal reserve don't wan. and then i was gonna do a bridge climb. in sydney don't one. and i'd wake up and be like hey man. now i'm not gonna go to. that thing and the thing is i let you know. here's something man i want to. talk about we got to. stop letting people [ __ ] talk into. stuff now it's fine. to be openminded. i get it and this is gonna sound a little narrowminded. but i didn't want to. do the bridge client and i know i don't do stuff. and my buddy joel was texting. me is like dude. if you don't do stuff in australia. i'm gonna [ __ ] kill you you're in another country. you got to do. this [ __ ] and i was like you know he's right you got to. open up yourself to. new ideas maybe i'll get new material. and so i was like okay. maybe i'll do the bridge class. and the night the day. before the bridge climb i was like i don't. think i want to. do the bridge climb and i was in the apparently. there's like this bridge and sydney you climb. and it's beautiful when you get on the top. of it and of course it. is but guess what you don't. really have to. do that stuff anymore. cuz google and also i that scene always comes to. mind the the [ __ ] scene in what is the the good. will hunting where matt. damon is like talking to. robin williams on a bench. of course cuz it's s his. cinematic but hey who talks to. anybody on a [ __ ] park bench when does that ever happen. have you ever had a conversation. with anybody on a goddamn park. bench no how come in every movie there's a scene. where somebody's talking to. somebody else on a goddamn park. bench hey i've got an even. better question where's a park. where's a park dude. if somebody said to. me meet me at a park. i'd go like this uh where is it. that where's that park what. are we in a [ __ ] romantic comedy. what are we in that. [ __ ] david duchovny mini driver one that came out for some reason. returned to me it. couldn't be more of a [ __ ] romantic comedy. return to me return to. me sick [ __ ] return to. me what was i talking. about oh the yeah so oh yeah when they're like when they're like you know. you know what it's like you. know how they made the sistine chapel. you know all about the thing. but have you ever been there. and looked at it and felt what it. feels like to be there and when i was a kid. i was like damn did. robert robin williams has a good point. but also google wasn't that. big then and now you can pretty. much go anywhere and do a 360 you know you can pretty much. go anywhere and do a 360 i can go to. [ __ ] zimbabwe if i want to. right now mmm a living room. and do a 360 and see all sorts. of [ __ ] whatever it's like in zimbabwe zimbabwe that's a crazy name ah so high did you ever think about how zimbabwe this is a [ __ ] word so anyway so so so so i didn't so i was like i don't think i'm gonna go to. the bridge climb and then there one. of the other promoters on the tour. because i was on my show. and she was like oh you gotta you gotta it's beautiful. you got a guy and i was like yeah. right okay and i'll let her make me think all. right i'll go and then i woke up in the morning. i didn't want to. [ __ ] go i should be true. to myself dude true. baby i should be true. to my god to. himself i didn't want to. go she's like no you should go. and you get [ __ ] talked into. it and then i wake up. in the morning i don't want to. go and i texted i you know what i'm not gonna go. and i felt guilty about that. i felt like i was letting them. down [ __ ] that first of all i didn't [ __ ] set up the tour the the bridge. climb i'm gonna do it. i don't want to. my producers 3:16 zimbabwe and it's like yyou know it. just looks like philly just looks like [ __ ] philly so so yeah so i i i i i didn't do the bridge. club and i didn't do the [ __ ] animal reserve and i didn't see a [ __ ] kangaroo and i don't give a [ __ ] how about that dude i didn't see a kangaroo you know why cuz i've seen that [ __ ] a kangaroo flexing on instagram i've seen that [ __ ] you seen that [ __ ] kangaroo with shoulders for [ __ ] sake kangaroos have shoulders naw i don't care i want to. see a koala [ __ ] my medicine. man i got dogs at home. they're the same [ __ ] thing you know so so i didn't do it and i [ __ ] you know what i did i walked around the cities took it in my mom was like you gotta sightsee make yourself to. it so i went to. that [ __ ] bondi beach everyone my buddies. who are musicians were hitting me. up and they were like dude. hottest chicks ever bestlooking people in the world. went to bondi beach. guess what thug lee's were out. there was zero goodlooking. people zero now i understand. it was an overcast. day but what's that mean. the troglodytes come out bondi. beach you know i went there. the uglies were out walked. around and then [ __ ] hopped in an uber back and i touched. the water because i felt like i should touch the water. because i wanted it. was so far away and then i went back. to them and i just i wanted. to drink by the way. the coffee in australia. is so much [ __ ] better it's unbelievable. i know i think i said this. in my last one. but it's like dude i don't understand. what the [ __ ] is america. doing pissing in it hey america. you wiping you [ __ ] with the ice. cubes they've got better. ice cubes they've got better.

objectified like a woman is i'm not you know i don't live with that fear of being raped everywhere i go like like women do so it's different for me 100% sure of course understand george bush what he did was it was a [ __ ] it was shameful and it was stupid and it was mostly not funny and offenders david coppafeel but to. call that sexual assault that's that word. needs to be looked at that. word needs to be looked at. assault you know what he was doing. pervin that's what he was doing. he was pervin and pervin is not okay. but also it's not assault. he was pervin if your night hey don't perv. and the older you get the easier. it is to. perv because you start. getting to that creepy. territory like i'm a 37 year. old guy if i check a girl. out at starbucks is it pervin i'll tell you what not if she's [ __ ] 32 if she's 20 is it pervert. it's a little bit more. pervin okay but if your [ __ ] 93 and you're checking out a 20 year old girl your pervin dude i just would the with the assault word you know what harvey weinstein did was assault what george w bush did was straight pervin dude and i'm not saying it's okay i would not do that but i also wouldn't think it's funny to. say hey who's your favorite. magician david copperfield oh god that's so not funny but come on man i want to. know if that scarred her. for life because somebody made a horrible joke. and [ __ ] felt
