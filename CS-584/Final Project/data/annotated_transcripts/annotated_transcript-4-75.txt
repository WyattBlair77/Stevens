chest. thug life terrible mobility that a bumboat. anyway come see me in houston and come see. me and all why can't the same. and see me in paso. dude i was thinking about this. i was when i was a kid. i was terrified of the dentist. like a basic kid. like just terrified of the of the dentist. which is stupid and i started. think about kids stories i told the freddy. krueger story again on on my podcast. about the about [ __ ] my pants. on my friend and my friend sleepover. [ __ ] my pants and and so i was thinking about the time my dad brought me to. the dentist and i don't know what my dad. did i think my dad. did it because my mom. was like chris is so scared. about going that design. i want to. deal with this [ __ ] so my dad stayed home from work and brought me to. the dentist and i remember when he brought me. i was like that i'm so scared. i don't want the dentist to. do what he does and put his [ __ ] tools on my mouth. and he was like you're gonna be fine. it'll be okay don't worry about. it you'll be fine. got to the dentist's office. and the dentist was like a really nice guy. my dad was friends. with him and [ __ ] i think but i don't think he was like friends first and then then became the dentist i think like it was like friends because he was a like a fun dentist. anyway so i got there and the guy was trying. to be so that this. was gonna be so good and like showing me. toys and like you get a prize. if you do this and and i was just scared. out of my mind and i was crying. i think to be brutally. honest with you guys and i was like i don't know about i don't know about this. i don't know i don't know and he was like trying. to get in my mouth. sounds really gross. and so and i couldn't do it. and i just couldn't bring myself. to do it and i got up. and i walked to. another chair and i sat. down and minutes went by. i mean a lot of minutes. went by and my dad. was like i gotta get to. work buddy i can't do this. so let's leave we'll do it. again another time and i was like okay. and and we left and i didn't do. it and driving home i was like he was like i know. you're scared but it's really okay. like it's not a big. deal i promise you. and something like clicked in my brain. and i was like okay. is there still time. to do it if i go. do it now and he's like i guess. so sure yeah yeah if you don't do it. now we could do it. and i said okay i can do. it he said okay. but if we go back then. you got to do. it for real and i was like no. i can do it okay. i'll really do it and i went back. i walked right into. that doctor's the dentist's office and he clean. my teeth and i remember as a kid. feeling so good about the fact. that i had to. overcome my fear granted ridiculous. fear but still i was scared. and it made me think about how fear is. just you know especially if you're scared. of something where nothing's. really gonna happen like a dentist. or talking in front of people. some people are scared of that. so we've got her scared. of you know playing the big. game or whatever the [ __ ] it is or her or running for office. whatever the [ __ ] it is you know like it's all that. kind of fear is all made up like fear. you know being in the middle. of a jungle and not having food. obviously is really scary. or something like that or being your or going. skydiving or whatever the [ __ ] but fear where nothing is really gonna happen nothing is really on the line like like it's all made up dude like you just made it up you're scared of not a thing going being scared going to. the dentist isn't really a fear you. know and if you're six years. old that's fine they can't. explain that to. a sixyearold now that. i'm a [ __ ] in my 30s. so young still but like you can just do the things i remember the first time. ever did stand up. i was scared and i was thinking like it's weird. it's just going up in front. of people and talking to. them and i remember taking my cell i was like if i just moved. my legs if i just take a step. toward the stage one at a time. i remember breaking this down. and thinking like move my right. leg move my left leg move my right leg move my left leg just keep doing that that's walking once i get on stage i'll then i'll be on stage and that's and then i just have to. start talking and that'll be doing standup. you know and it remember just breaking. it down like as a as a kid. too if i just do it. if i go walk over and get to. that dentist chair i'll. be in the dentist chair and then there's nothing i can. do i'm already halfway. done base i'm already done basically if i decide if you decide to. do something that's all you're done. if you decide to. do it you're done. if you fully decide to. do something you already did. it because it's gonna happen. do you understand take working. out you're you're fat or you want to. lose weight or you're not in shape. you say you know what i want. to go work out today. but i don't want to. go work out today but i've already decided i'm gonna do it so you know that it's done. because you're gonna do it you create the [ __ ] [ __ ] you create your day you create your destiny right i hate when people say [ __ ] like that but it's you know you don't create you all of your destiny but you create those [ __ ] things it's done i already got my teeth cleaned it's done when is it tomorrow. well it didn't happen yet. yeah it did because i decided for that [ __ ] to. happen my sunglasses are on right. now no it's not no they're not. i'm looking at you yeah. but i already decided that they're gonna go. on so that means there's good as on. the futures tube ride i'm. telling you dude. once you get that mentality. man and i'm no life. coach but i'm a [ __ ] life coach. dude once you get that. mentality of it's done. i decided that this is going. to happen it is so whoever needs. to hear this rivers listening. to the [ __ ] whether you're in your cubicle you're driving to. work you're at the beach. or listening to. this [ __ ] at the gym. it's done if you decided now but i want to. go home now okay then that's what you decided then that's done. yeah but i should do one. more set then you already decided. it's done you know oh that's how i get [ __ ] done. i decide to. do it it's really as easy as that dude. it really is you didn't decide to. do it if you didn't [ __ ] do it it's about the decision. anyway dude that's annoying that i said all that. what's kind of true. my dad would always say you know. people would say how did you know. you wanted to be a director he's a director you. know and he would say well. you decide you're a director and you'd be like what. it's not that easy and he said yeah. but he would always say this. he was like popeye doesn't walk. around saying i'm gonna be popeye he's [ __ ] popeye and i was like yeah even though that sounds so dumb it's so true. i love simple [ __ ] like that popeyes. popeye dude um by the way he's on before the calamari. story i told ya last week. he was like i know you don't have guests. on your podcast but i want. to [ __ ] call in um maybe i should call him right now i wonder if he'll pick up let me see if i pick up bill d'elia. let's do it here let me. make sure that even they've been but he's not doing. anything i'm calling my dad. what are you doing yo. you want to. want to i'm um i'm on my podcast. you want to. talk about your calamari thing. here i'll put you on speaker. go ahead state your [ __ ] claim ok so my claim is you can't slam a guy for the way. he eats calamari first. of all you're wrong you're wrong. go ahead incorrect ok because because because first of all you your claim is that. somebody eats calamari should. know how they like to. eat calamari should know that. they like that's [ __ ] no because you can like to. eat calamari with sauce and without sauce. yeah i know but each calamari. you eat you should know. how much sauce you want. it for that calamari no. your each one you eat if you like it. with sauce or without sauce. you should be able to. decide ok i like that's crazy. dude in the way you eat something. but but but it if you have listen. if you have ok so here's what happened. you had the [ __ ] calamari. oh you had to. calamari's on the thing you poked one. good good through and then you poked another one. and it was dangling off. ok and i and i knew it. was gonna fall off in the sauce. and you [ __ ] it fell off in the sauce. and then you ate the one with half. the sauce on it. and then you just dip your fork. and got the other one. put it in the fit in your mouth. and you liked both of those. the same amount of ways. yes no you're lying ok so then you don't care. you don't allow for. the for the fact that someone could like both versions. of that you don't allow. that okay okay so if you were gonna order. calamari alright if you were gonna order [ __ ] alright so okay okay okay so if you were gonna order calamari and they said okay but just so you know we ran out of sauce you'd still get two calamari yes okay what if they said okay just so you know just so you know we got the calamari but we we dropped them all in the sauce and everywhere and we just basically have a a plate of calamari but it's all got sauce all over it you'd you'd say yes to. that too like way. better it was all in sauce. okay so so you're saying that because you dropped it. in the sauce it doesn't matter. that much but you still like it. that way and it and yeah. see that's the kind of thing. where i just it's like if a guy like that. you can trust less than a guy. who knows how he likes. his calamari that's what i'm saying. you like me less no. i don't like you less. but it's like you're the guy. in the movie that like doublecrosses. someone but no you aren't that guy. but if you were in a book. if your character was in a book. and like they were like and he was eating. calamari and one dropped off. in the sauce and he still ate it. just like he ate the one. without the sauce you and then that. guy went on page like 600. 700 and he like [ __ ] took the the the the hero. of the of the story for a ride. and was like a dick. about it he'd be like oh okay. i get it the foreshadowing was the [ __ ] calamari. eating okay bottom line bottom line. yeah i accept your apology. there's no [ __ ] apology dude you're the guy i told you this but you're the guy who gets the [ __ ] truck with the flatbed and gets the top over it because he doesn't know how he wants his [ __ ] truck yeah i get that all right i love you and that's where i kiss you on the face every [ __ ] time it's in my eye it's in my eye about whatever it's too high mom knows you make it be about your eye but it's on your cheek whatever man you know where you want to. kiss [ __ ] and that's the id. you should know how to. have your calamari all. right all right i'll talk. to you later love you. it's a wrong number all right. you guys there you have it. you wanted to call. it in status claim and that's what's up. with the calamari [ __ ] and that's it. dude we're done
