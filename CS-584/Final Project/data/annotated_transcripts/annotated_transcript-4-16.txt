[ __ ] npr so uh yeah so i was at complex. con and they went to. go get the shirt and then whatever dude. it's just like ups had an installation. there where it was just like a ups. truck was there and then they just had a bunch of boxes. and then you could [ __ ] wait in line. and have a bag they would stamp. the ups on the bag. and you could take the bag. home and you could purchase it. sucker okay i mean dude. sucker dude first of all you're a sucker. if you go to. the complex con fine. whatever i bought some shirts. i went for some content and it was fine. was it too hot. yes was the food too. far away yes was a parking lot even further than where the food was yes when we got to. the food place was the line. too long yes was it. healthy food no well what was it fried food is that good for me. no did i wait. in line a little bit and then get out. of it when i realized that. yes did i spend time yes but did i [ __ ] put the video up. on youtube and did it. go bonkers viral yes so it's all. good you know i keep it. dummy viral right okay so anyway. we went to. complex con and um you know. there were just [ __ ] guys with weird boots and then of course there's always the thing at any convention. where there's just the naked. chicks that are painted instead of wearing clothes hey selegel like why. is that okay just because we're in a [ __ ] dude i swear to. god they do the craziest jankiest [ __ ] in in in conventions and they get away. with it just because it's like no. it's part of it dude. you could [ __ ] walk up and have a booth. called the stabbin booth and anyone that walks by you. just kind of slit them. a little bit just on their side. as they walk by you poke them. in the abs they'll be like oh on the side. oblique oh and you'll be like hey dude welcome. to stab and con this. is the stab and this is the stab inside. of stab and con and they're like jesus. christ you're making me bleed. and they're like that'll be 250. and they just give it to. you and they're like my god actually. can you get my brother. he's coming by soon to. be a good prank and they'd be like oh i gotta go. to the car and get another knife. anyway dude um so yeah so complexcon uh we did. that and uh it was what it. was dude i don't know how to. [ __ ] be at that place. took a lot of pictures. of people they you know. it was really nice to. see some fans you know i really liked that a lot. um and then i saw people that are like like sneakily. trying to take a picture. and i'm just dude. when i see people dude. when you're when you're like [ __ ] when people know who you are and then you see people like this like trying to. take pictures like this like anyone ever holds. their [ __ ] phone like this like this is my favorite when they're just like this. when they're just like this. and you're sitting next to. them and you're and you're like okay. i gotta i think most [ __ ] celebrities are like i gotta pretend like i don't see this. and just let him get away. with it or tell him. to stop but i don't do either. of those things right. you know i'm you know i'm an original. right i'm not a carbon copy so i say hey man. why don't you just ask. for a picture that's what i do. and they say oh what oh what every time. the same it's the same. thing oh what that's what they say. every time i say why. don't you just take a picture. with me and they say oh okay. okay and then they do it. and they say nope yo. buddy have a good day. and then they walk away. because nobody's ever holding their. phone like this do you know what i'm saying. we all get it. everybody who [ __ ] by the way people who are on tv or [ __ ] have followings we this happens all day to. us right so you know what you do. when i see somebody [ __ ] uber famous. even like way way famous like way. more famous than me. um i walk up and i just go like this. right to their face. if that's what i want i go. like this because they think well there's no way. he had the audacity to. just walk up and snap me. gave away my secret it's all. good right now is the time. where i would hit that. runner's thing but the [ __ ] key. map isn't working ah yes dude. it's not working at all. oh dude i quit out of it. and i [ __ ] turned it back on and now it's [ __ ] working and yes dude it's loading to. hit him up it's loading the back. in black it's loading the [ __ ] make my dreams. come true and the one thing. it loaded at the end. was [ __ ] [music] yes dude the timing is everything but we move on you know what i mean we move on dude. that was a late runner but we move. on man so we were at complex. con and [ __ ] ups had an installation. and then of course i had to. leave we were uh we were uh yeah. we had a good time. so it's okay it's okay i woke. up the next day dude. actually you know what's been happening. to me lately. [ __ ] this is the biggest idiot [ __ ] ever this is hilarious this. is so stupid but um so if you're a fan. of the podcast and if you're all caught up. by the way one of my favorite things. to do is to. walk into. a group of people. and say are you guys all caught up. on my podcast i do that. when i go to. [ __ ] shows like my shows and i see people in the green room and i say is everybody caught up. on my podcast to. other [ __ ] famous people and then we all have a laugh dude. but that's just like a [ __ ] that's just like you know what i mean. that's just that's just like a little taste. of what i that's just like a taste. of humor you know. what i mean for you. guys but um uh so yeah so i you know. if you're if you listen to. the show you know i take gabapentin. to keep you know. to for i guess it's for anxiety. i don't really feel like it. does anything to. my anxiety but also it's supposed. to keep my restless leg syndrome. a little bit at bay. now it did in the beginning. and then it stopped so the only only thing that helps it. is busting you know. that that's the only thing that helps. my restless syndrome because when you do. busting it provides a nice. dopamine shot inside your brain and then it releases inside your body and then you could conk out at least for me that's how it works um and you know it's legit because i googled it and it was in an issue of cosmopolitan in 2012. so bustin helps rls anyway um i still take the gabapentin because i think that i should be taking it because it's a good thing to. take to keep my anxiety. at bay as well so i take 300 milligrams or whatever. the [ __ ] before i go to. bed now uh that's pretty much what i i don't really go. to i don't travel to. zanny island too much anymore. i don't take xanax i do. have them but i don't really take them. right um anyway uh i take also lexapro to. keep my ocd in check yes. i actually have ocd i'm not just one. of those [ __ ] chicks that's like oh my god i'm so ocd. i love to. have my room clean and i love jackets. but um so i do actually have it. diagnosed um but um i also have a bite plate. that i use for my uh tmj. disorder so basically all i'm trying. to say is yeah boy. he's falling apart um so sleep. is necessary now i got a bite plate. does it help my tmj. no all right did it. a little bit in the beginning. yes that's the whole thing. with medications and also like crutches or whatever. the [ __ ] you're doing with ailments. you're trying to make it. better and keep it good. and it works for a little bit. and then it doesn't and then the problem is you tell the doctor hey it's feeling. a lot better and he's like good and then you're like oh [ __ ] it's actually not you go back. and you say actually it's not helping and then the doctor gets a little bit of a you. know defensive vibe and he's like okay well you said it was and you're like yeah i realize it do it but not for the long. haul and you know that's what i mean. so stop trying to [ __ ] do you're a doctor don't be defensive. right so i realize now i'm sleeping. on my side and i can't [ __ ] sleep. on my side because when i sleep. on my side even though. i have the bite plate. and it makes my jaw even. it pushes the bottom of my jaw. to the left and it [ __ ] makes that little soft. part unhinge and [ __ ] stay there and now i wake up. at my jaw not only feels like it's in pain. but it's off to. the left so i'm up. pissed off i wake up. now you know when i wake up. i wake up sometimes at 7. 30 or 5 30 or 6. or 8 8 a.m right. but then i go back to. sleep right i wake up. where a normal person. would wake up and be like you know. what i'm gonna wake up. and start my day i can't. get back to sleep. but it's my body and i get pissed. and i want to. sleep more and even though. i'm awake i wait it. out and sometimes it takes 40 minutes but i still wait it out. and i fall asleep and that's when i have the hardcore. vicious dreams okay now and then i'm like oh maybe [ __ ] 10 30 or something like that right. so before i fall asleep. and i have the hardcore. vicious dreams you wake up. what do you do. you wake up what's one. of the first things you do besides pissing you. take it you're parched. right so take a sip of water. so i take a sip of water. and it's very bitter and i'm just like what the [ __ ] gross. so i'm like ah whatever fall asleep. do some hardcore sleeping. wake up forgot that it. was bitter thought maybe i was dreaming. that it was bitter. took another [ __ ] sip of the water. sure enough it's bitter so i'm like ew. gross so i so i walk downstairs. and kristen is with calvin and i say to. her babe did you [ __ ] mix up the drinks. because sometimes she has medication that she just puts. half of it in the water. and stirs it around i'm like you mixed. up the [ __ ] drinks you know like it it got all bitter i got yours. and she's like what do you mean. was it on your side. you take it did you take the one. on my side and i'm like nah. i was on my side. she's like i didn't put it on your side. i was like what the [ __ ] is it i don't do that. [ __ ] right and she whatever the conversation [ __ ] devolved and it's fine i wrote it off a [ __ ] week or two goes by and then i wake up in the middle of the night parched and sure enough the [ __ ] [ __ ] is bitter the water's bitter and i know now that i'm in control of this water. because it already happened. to me once and for once. shame on you fool me. twice shame on me. right that's how it goes that's how the saying goes so i know i'm in control. of this water so either. either someone is breaking into. my house and drugging me or kristen. is secretly putting stuff. in my drink or it's my fault. and i don't want it. to be the last one. at all i'd rather someone be breaking in and [ __ ] with me. or kristen b to. be doing a prank and you know. how i feel about pranks. i hate him that's what unfunny people. do so so i oh by the way. [ __ ] i i did have an uh prank show on in development. and netflix i just want to. say that's what they were saying. it was it was never supposed. to be a prank show. i don't know why they [ __ ] put that in the news. by that so don't be all coming at me. like oh yeah you don't like prince. well would you do prank show. it was never supposed to. be a prank show anyway. so uh so i i'm like what the [ __ ] i it's bitter again. and not only that it's bitter. and i realize there's something in my mouth. so now i immediately think oh a spider. went in my water and i don't know why i think this but that's what i think and i'm it's it's the amount. of certainty that i have that. it's a spider that went. in my water the amount of certainty. was was like oh well chris are there. clouds in the sky oh well. yes right and even if you can't. see them well certainly they're there. somewhere right that's how i would so i get up. because there's something in my mouth. walk over to. the bathroom like a zombie. because i'm half asleep and then i spit. out in the toilet bowl take a tinkle and i don't have my glasses on so i'm trying to. look at what's in. the [ __ ] toilet bowl i'm trying to. see the spider i see nothing. so now i'm like you know what i dreamt. it i'm like you know what i [ __ ] dreamt it. [ __ ] it i'm going back. to sleep i'm having dreams. of of like waking up and tasting. water and it's [ __ ] tasting the way. it's tasting because i'm half. asleep so i go back. to sleep and then i wake up. and i drink it and it's [ __ ] dude yes it's bitter again. [music] two of those because it was bitter. twice and as a matter of fact. the first time and he did it. again yes dude the water's. bitter yes do i have a brain. tumor right because water's just water. water tastes like nothin [music]. hey there you know. finding the right supplements to. fit your lifestyle it can be hard. all right in a sea. of marketing and hype. brands often skip out. what's important quality ingredients right. hrsupplements dot com provides pure and lab. tested products at an affordable price hrsupplements dot com. offers a wide variety of supplement. brands for all lifestyles muscle. empire for the muscle conscious. gym goers harvest naturals for the immunity focused. and for those needing to. add that extra bit of edge. to their focus uh the bottom line. is no matter what your lifestyle. hrsupplements dot com has you covered. with over 150 lab. tested products i like the uh preworkout powder it. gets me in the mood. for a workout i you know. i take it and then boom all of a sudden. i'm working out and i'm more shredded. it goes by it's fun. i'm into it you know. what i mean sometimes you're not into. the workout but you are when you take this. and then i go in and i'm just pumped. and i'm having i'm having a good. time and i'm keeping it shredded. you know me uh with hr supplements. wide variety of products. and brands i can be the healthiest. version of myself and so can you their website. makes it easy to. browse and build my ideal supplement stack and they even have prebuilt stacks available so that's cool you don't have to. do the work if you don't want to. that's why i love hr supplements. and it's why you love them. too so treat your body. right this holiday season head. over to hrsupplements dot com. to get 20 off your first order. by using my code. congrats at checkout [music]. so i get up and now i'm pissed. i'm like how the [ __ ] is it i mean i'm so 41. what the [ __ ] is a [ __ ] goddamn water. tasting all [ __ ] and i go back. to look in the toilet. bowl again because i'm like i'm gonna find this.

[ __ ] yeah man you know he keeps getting the right dosage of gabapentin and it still doesn't help. his rls and he results to. boston yeah dude oh my god return of the mack. [ __ ] yeah dude he tells stories too long but the babies. are with them dude. because this is a cult. and we'll be in high grass. sharing ideas wearing all white or maybe all blue. because all white is [ __ ] synonymous with the kkk. outside of a log cabin in the daytime. and inside of that. log cabin at night dude. you're with me dude. oh man [ __ ] yeah man it's so awesome. dude life right it's so awesome. that sometimes you're driving. home from a place when i was driving. home from a place recently with kristin. and uh this guy's just driving next. to us and he looks at me. hi as a [ __ ] dude. hi the [ __ ] and uh higher. than the [ __ ] did i make it up who knows who cares. and um what how about the song. that goes my gun wait. my whip talked to. me watch talk to. me my god my gun talk to. me blow it up homie. where's translator um so i was so we're driving and then this guy drives by and he's higher. than a [ __ ] do it and he's in the passenger. seat and this chick is driving. and he looks at me. and he's laughing and i'm like oh this. guy is blasted out of his mind but also maybe he recognizes me i don't know i mean. this guy could think i'm [ __ ] chris angel for all i mean he's so high [ __ ] it he's so high he could think i'm jeffrey rush right um i mean i look a little bit like chris angel but this guy's so high i could [ __ ] be uh christian bale when he was playing uh the vice president. dick cheney i i don't know what he's seeing but he's laughing. and his face are she's so red. uh and he's like what's up. dude and i'm like hey man. he's like nice car i'm like cool. thanks and he says wanna. buy a dog and those are the weirdest two. sentences together to. say to anybody nice. car and then wanna buy. a dog okay because of course i don't wanna. buy a dog right. because who wants to. buy a dog first of all. if you want to. buy a dog rescue a dog. right but if you don't want to. find if you want to. buy a purebred okay but then you go to. the place right you don't just have a guy. in a ford explorer drive. up with his tongue hanging out of the window. the guy and then he says want to. buy a dog and i say what are you. talking about you have dogs. and he goes like this. and lifts up his arms. he's holding three french bulldogs little puppies and i'm just like oh [ __ ] and kristen is so she's just already starts thinking oh this is something is like her mind immediately goes to. oh they're breeding them for. cage fighting that's what they are. they're bait dogs they're bait. dogs for the cage that's what they are they're bait. dogs like literally like i look over at kristen and her eyes. are welling up. and i'm like maybe it's fine. they're probably fine he's just trying. to make some money and i was like what what do. you have three french bulldogs for and he's and he's like oh dude. i'm going to sell him. for 5 000 each but if you want 3 000 for you and i'm just like hey man. don't negotiate because i didn't even want. it in the first place. anyway i got two but um no yeah so weird. la is [ __ ] crazy bonkers dude. it's the end of the world. is my point it's the end. of the [ __ ] world guys are outside of [ __ ] ford. explorers just hawking french. bulldogs the most sought after [ __ ] dogs. that you could possibly. get by the way french bulldogs go for like you know you could buy a [ __ ] lamborghini. eures for the price of a bench. a french bulldog i'll say i'll say french. bench uh french bulldog foghorn leghorn. been doing a lot of [ __ ] watching this. documentary the toys that made us and i

undeniable. pete found the side he was like i'm hilarious. but also i'll just [ __ ] figure out how to. be nutella to. these chicks amplify amplify double it. double i'm gonna keep doubling until. they kill me i can't. say the real quote because it's got the n word in it. but that's what tupac said. yeah man um it's so weird. man i was watching like the hollywood. thing is like when you meet somebody and you date. somebody it's just like you you get all. this press about you. and then you become in the system. and then all of a sudden you're one of those guys and like i was looking at a [ __ ] video of kevin hart. who seems like a [ __ ] fantastic. dad by the way. and he was on the court. the basketball court and and he had his son. with him and he was like the players. was all like they were all talking to. the kid and the caption on the thing. was kevin hart's the father. of the year because his son. was like hanging out with these guys. and um i'm just like looking at it. and i'm like they just had they have it. all wrong like kevin hart. isn't father of the year. because that like his son. he has access to. [ __ ] these things it's that he's literally hanging out with his son and he's being a good dad because he kisses. him on the forehead. and [ __ ] like that but like you know just because mellow anthony or whoever the [ __ ] his name is i don't even know anymore. but i think that's a guy's name. gave him david's son. to the shoes it's like that's not what makes a good. dad right we glorify. these [ __ ] things and like here's the other thing. too like after everything. that i went through like all these [ __ ] who just like backstabbed me and just turned on me. without even asking me. any questions about it right. who just didn't even call. me up and say hey what's going on they were all of a sudden just like [ __ ] them we don't need [ __ ] them right like friends people that i thought were my friends like it's just like this this [ __ ] is just it's so fake dude it's so fake like that's not the important [ __ ] man and i was like how is how is i said to. my therapist i was like how is calvin gonna know. uh that like the [ __ ] that was said about me. is untrue and my therapist said you're he's just gonna know. because he's gonna know you and i was like sometimes. you say the most simplest [ __ ] dude. a therapist sometimes says the most simplest. [ __ ] it puts everything into. [ __ ] perspective and dude you're like you know what you're right. he's gonna know me. dude what am i worried. about something that's gonna [ __ ] just be the best. dad you could [ __ ] be and that doesn't involve what. you have and what you get and [ __ ] like that i don't want. to get all [ __ ] serious. but speaking of me i don't not wanting to. get all serious the travis. scott thing uh 11. people died dude or something. like that which is absolutely. [ __ ] crazy this travis scott thing at astroworld yeah. it's really [ __ ] sad i have a lot. of [ __ ] i want to. say about this i don't know if i'll say it. and i don't know if it'll come. out right but i was in the shower. the other way talking about. it by myself and i was absolutely killing. it i was just washing my armpits. and another thing you know. you [ __ ] [ __ ] don't get it you know you're saying this and it's that you ever be in the shower just besides say [ __ ] singing i'll be in a worldclass debate people are like yeah you sing in the shower like that's the funny thing [ __ ] singing bro i'm [ __ ] killing. it i'm on npr telling all. those [ __ ] i'm tupac on those brothers. and your [ __ ] don't actually it doesn't actually matter but this stupid [ __ ] that you're talking about doesn't matter and they're all like turning like oh man he's kind of right. dude i got the whole npr [ __ ] quitting. their jobs in my shower. but this travis scott [ __ ] happened um apparently there wasn't enough security. i don't know they didn't have. enough you know what the whole. [ __ ] thing is for me. i don't know what happened. we don't know what all. we know is the end. result 11 people died or whatever it is we don't know what happened you don't know what happened you don't really know how it happened and you don't know who did what and guess what you also don't know you don't know that travis scott saw people dying and kept performing here's the thing that's driving me nuts dude everybody is saying they're trying to. cancel travis scott because he should have. known his concerts are toxic. his concerts are dangerous. and he knew what he was doing. and these are old clips. we pulled up now somehow we're just [ __ ] showing them. for they're just seeing the light of day. now even though we're all saying. we always knew he was toxic. and he always knew he was toxic. and now and now this is what happened. and see what happens. if we could have prevented it. when it's like you were holding on to. the video anyway what the [ __ ] were you holding on to. the video for were you waiting. for somebody to die. oh but it's travis's. fault everyone's saying it's travis's. fault he needs to. nike should chill. on travis he should be banned. from [ __ ] coachella oh because it's travis's fault. because why because [ __ ] uh niall horan. who i [ __ ] love did a concert. with the guitar and stopped in the middle. of it and said hold. on they're acting up and people we have to. make sure that they're safe. why because because he's a good. guy and because [ __ ] that absolutely makes sense. when some guy's strumming his guitar. and because you could stop and be like hold on guys. i see something in the front row. and this is unsafe but astroworld. travis scott literally there's a [ __ ] phoenix coming out of the ashes. on fire pyrotechnics [ __ ] uh uh clouds and smoke. and loud ass [ __ ] hip hop music and and you think that travis scott saw in the crowd somehow 10 different. people dying and and saw that. and then thought you know. what [ __ ] it this next one's about my rims. you actually think that these [ __ ] on ticktock are going viral. like i was a medic i was in emt. i was at the concert. and you know what it. was so hard to. breathe yeah it was hard. to breathe and travis should be stopped and travis should stop yeah. oh travis should stop oh it's travis's. fault it's travis's fault. it's his fault travis is. a singer dude travis is a singer. and as a matter of fact. he was the only one that. wasn't in that crowd the dude. was 900 feet in the air. on a [ __ ] pole like he's david blaine with cool. shoes on and you think he's busy looking down at somebody who might be by the way what about the people. who were passing out. pills for [ __ ] saying. there were one thing that weren't there was a whole. article about how other people were passing. out pills and [ __ ] this [ __ ] was was making people overdose what about the security what about the [ __ ] police what about what about you what about you you were at the concert. it's not your fault. at all yeah it might singularly not be your fault. you might have stood back but you know. what else that means you don't. know what travis saw you. don't know it's his fault. everyone wants to. blame the [ __ ] on top it. all trickles down travis shows. up in some cool shoes. and some dreadlocks and [ __ ] rap some songs it's a travesty. and it sucks and it's horrible. man and my heart [ __ ] breaks for those. kids there was a 10. year old kid that died. but you're gonna put a video on tick. tock here's why i think travis. should be canceled you're using. this [ __ ] for your agenda. you were in the crowd it's more. your fault than travis's. fault i'm [ __ ] sick and tired of people just blaming the powerful. people you came up everyone. got a participation trophy. everyone got a [ __ ] mr hustle. and because of that you're now. 20 years old saying hey look it's that guy's fault miles and miles and scores and acres away. when you're right [ __ ] there when security's there the police are there the medics were there the medics are there yeah we shouldn't have been that way what about how you're the medic you just [ __ ] up that's what happened. it was unfortunate and terrible. learn from it but trying to. get [ __ ] nike to. not make a [ __ ] travis scott shoe everyone's on tick. tock i was there. and you know what i couldn't. believe it like they're the [ __ ] goddamn uh uh uh the new woodward and bernstein. cartoon on fox kids you don't know. what the [ __ ] happened everyone thinks they're a goddamn investigative. reporter dude you were just there you bought a ticket you don't know what happened and then i saw this and then i saw that no you saw what you saw it was harrowing and it was horrible and guess what you're not going to. be able to. articulate it in one minute on [ __ ] tick tock to. a [ __ ] lacroix ray beat or whatever the [ __ ] that rapper is leroy craig lacroix bray lacroix i don't know i like lacroix so i just [ __ ] say lecroy it's just so [ __ ] backwards dude you think travis saw people dying i mean people really think oh he he knew this thing is toxic and he's [ __ ] and he [ __ ] knew you think that this [ __ ] was up and i'll say it dude people are [ __ ] and they won't [ __ ] say it it's soft. as [ __ ] man gen z [ __ ] the [ __ ] up man [ __ ] up sometimes real [ __ ] happens and it's not that person's fault. you were there you all. [ __ ] up everyone [ __ ] up gen z a lot of you listen to. this podcast i'm [ __ ] telling you man i promise. you travis scott didn't want. people to die at his [ __ ] concert. it's laughable dude it's like the wokest. of the woke you're a [ __ ] cubanon it's the same. [ __ ] thing you're believing [ __ ] you might as well be s uh at the [ __ ] in dallas waiting for the real jfk to. show up he's dead [ __ ] you think those q and out. [ __ ] are are out to. lunch you think they're lunatics you're doing the same [ __ ] thing oh well travis scott always knew and this and that he could have been more like a [ __ ] other you know you don't know it's like [ __ ] woken on it's the new q anon. q anon got [ __ ] when trump didn't no. okay all right well [ __ ] it uh okay fine now there's like eight guys. out standing next to. a highway waiting for [ __ ] jfk to. reemerge that's what q. anon is and these work [ __ ] are like see dave chappelle he hates everyone and then also travis scott needs to. go to jail because he was singing. a song while people died. you don't get it dude. and guess what you know. what i don't either i don't either. but at least i shut the [ __ ] up and i'm just talking [ __ ] to. you and i don't know what the [ __ ] happened. let the police do their [ __ ] goddamn thing let security figure out where their flaws were and where their holes. were i'm getting so [ __ ] heated dude let's just throw one of these in for [ __ ] good measure i'm queuing. on i believe that [ __ ] jfk is coming back. and he's that guy who's got the long. hair and the weird beard whatever. the [ __ ] that guy is just all i'm saying dude. travis scott i know. you're listening and just keep your [ __ ] head up man. you ain't [ __ ] unless you have 10 000. haters and you got you got more than that. so you're doing a lot. better that's that 10 thousand. hater rule dude that i [ __ ] always think about i put it in my i made it up it's in my head i've never spoken out. loud but dude everyone's if you got to. you know you ain't [ __ ] until you got 10. 000 haters man that's when you really. know you're doing some [ __ ] right so when you got ten thousand [ __ ] on twitter yelling at you that you should die. that's when you know. you take a breath. and you know you're the [ __ ] man. dude got way too serious. everybody knows right everybody. knows you all know you're all. woodward and [ __ ] bernstein okay anyway this [ __ ] is hilarious. following the this is a this. is a moment a top. moment on twitter that my producer. sent me this is a moment. on twitter following the release of a new. trailer of for the film. being the ricardo's first of all. that name sucks being the ricardo's. starring nicole kidman as comedy. icon lucille ball some continue to. share their disappointment that deborah messing wasn't cast in the role. instead all right first of all i can't. believe there's even one person. that thinks that but there is there's a bunch of people okay. i just how do you not how do you not. go immediately after even if you think that you don't. think oh well but nicole kidman's one. of the most famous and they want the oh yeah. they want the movie to. make money that's right. i forgot how i don't know. how you like these people don't get how it works. you just need someone who's going. to [ __ ] drive ticket sales. debra messing was famous for his show 105 years ago all right man and uh i just so there's a bunch of people i guess talking about this and it's a top thing on twitter this is kind of [ __ ] sucks okay and i'll tell you why it sucks it's just so negative like why is the it's so irresponsible of twitter to. put this on as a top. moment it only makes everybody. involved feel bad do you understand. what i'm talking about let's just break it. down okay uh nicole kidman. reads oh everyone a lot of some a bunch of people want. deborah messing to. do the part and not me. okay well good that makes my day. that makes her feel like [ __ ] deborah messing reads. this and think oh that's nice but of course i can't. get the role because nicole kids. are gonna do it [ __ ] hollywood all right. and it makes the producers think did we make a mistake. it's just so negative dude. the fact that this is a thing. like just twitter just [ __ ] talk about how somebody had a kid or some [ __ ] or somebody bought balloons i can't wait till [ __ ] the [ __ ] changes who knows if it ever will oh man i didn't mean to. get [ __ ] this podcast is turning into. a drama it's turning. into [ __ ] like some serious. like li liking speech [ __ ] where you're just. like whoa oh god. yeah it's kind of funny. but also it just makes you feel weird. and like it's funny that he's stuttering. but like also it's sad. you know that's what it. is i decided to. cave i'm getting a haircut. i'm i'm not gonna just get my i'm not gonna do it. i haven't cut my own. hair for like a year and a half. i'm caving your boy's caving all. good things come to. an end that choppy [ __ ] thing with the hair. was cool it was nice but it was just you know. caught caught the back of my head. in a few videos. and thought okay time. to sit down in that. chair i'm going to. go back to the to. yeah i'm just going to. go back to the place. i used to. go to and then i'm going. to do it they're going. to cut it i'm going. to get mad but then in like three four. five days it's going. to start to look banging. right because that's when haircuts start. looking banging they're really. bad and then they start looking banging. i'm sweating and that's that. while we're done
