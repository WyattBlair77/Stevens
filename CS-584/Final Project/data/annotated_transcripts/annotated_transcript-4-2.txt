[ __ ] and like worlds. and like lettered like her mom would let kristen do crazy. like there was like do whatever they want. day they had to. do whatever they want day. once a year and she would be like what do you want. to do and kristen would be like i want. to swim from [ __ ] 9. a.m to 8 p.m and her mom. would be like okay and they'd just be in the pool. the whole time and it's like bad. mom but good mom you know. because she turned out to. be a great person but she would be like i just want. to eat cake for breakfast. and mom would be like okay. bad mom but also good mom. you know once in a day. you got to let your [ __ ] you got to. let the people do that right. it's why they it's like it's why. they give [ __ ] uh convicts uh you know uh uh [ __ ] a workout place. when it's like you know they don't really need to. get stronger what are they doing. because beat the [ __ ] at each other but it's how they get their aggression out. right so um yeah she'd be like what. do you want to. do and she's like let's go. into murdering spree and she'd be like okay. today's the only day. bad mom a good mom right. it's like the purge so. um so anyway uh you know she took that with her. and made her you know. it made her you know. want to be a good mom. which is great and so so kristen now. is like wanting to. do all the [ __ ] for calvin. which is awesome and i got to. be like they're also thinking like about. about how awesome. it is but also i want to. be like you know like life isn't always going. to be like this man. don't get like [ __ ] so don't think that you're you know it's always going to. be like this right. people aren't gonna always be happy. you walk into. a room right like i don't wanna. tell him this yet because he's only [ __ ] two but like when he walks into. a room it doesn't matter who's in that. room plus he only knows like 25. people still because of covid. the first year of his [ __ ] life he knew like 12. people and that's it. and every one time he walked into. a room everyone would be like oh my god hi. like dude like he's a prince. or some [ __ ] and so he's gonna grow up and i gotta be like bro. you know just i don't know. when the right time. is to be like yo bro. it's not always gonna be like this. you gotta you know you're gonna walk in a room. sometimes and people are gonna [ __ ] hate you i don't wanna. be like that because that's what i always thought i don't know. what it was about my childhood. but like i have this thing where whenever i walk. into a room i think everyone's gonna [ __ ] hate me i think either what they think is oh that guy saw me on stage and doesn't like my comedy. or knows somebody that knows me that. doesn't like me and heard about me. that is and thinks i'm a piece. of [ __ ] or something and i've always thought that in my life. i need to walk into. a room and win people over. now am i working that. out in therapy yes does it is it. some deep cedar itches yes does it come. to do my childhood. yes was my childhood great. yes but did i have microaggressions. probably is it okay. learning about it right. okay and it's all good. my babies because i'm becoming a person. i was born the same. year my son was so um so in a way we're both. too but uh yeah so we she was like kristen. was like you take him. to the tar. pits and when you do i'm gonna redecorate his whole. room he loves dinosaurs calvin loves [ __ ] dinosaurs and so she was like okay her mom came out and they both got to. [ __ ] like it's not even like they just paint they painted it they [ __ ] cut out dinosaurs. she drew dinosaurs on wood. she cut out dinosaurs and dude. she [ __ ] like literally like cut out wood pieces. of dinosaurs and then took those wood. pieces out and glued them. together to make a trex it's like unfucking. believable anyway you can go on it. you can see the more crystallia. channel uh surprising calvin and dude. she turned to her. uh uh turned the calvin's. room while we were at the tar. pits seeing dinosaurs by the way. and the [ __ ] security dude. ruined it man i was like kevin. wanna go see dinosaurs. he was like more dinosaurs. and he was like there's no dinosaurs. in there and i was like what's this. guy talking about what do they just have what. are they at the tarpon. and i walked in and i realized they have woolly. mammoths and sabertwo tigers and [ __ ] like that and they weren't technically dinosaurs like there's no trexes and no [ __ ] stegosauruses or ankylosauruses. but i'm like this security. guard is gonna [ __ ] like like he's gonna like [ __ ] bigtime me and be like actually you know it's sabertoothed tigers a different. time period they they actually existed. with uh peop humans and dinosaurs. didn't just makes me laugh. how you saying dinosaurs. when in actuality they're you're going. to go in there there's going to. be there's no diplois hearts. in there to be brutally. honest with you and it's like dude. okay but i'm with a twoyearold. right and i grew up. my whole life thinking that. there were dinosaurs at the [ __ ] la brea tar. pits and guess what it's fine. i'm 41 and i'm still kicking right. and calvin walks in he's just more. dinosaurs and now calvin's. pointing to a [ __ ] sabertwo tiger saying dinosaur dinosaur. and i know it's not a dinosaur. because of the security guard. and he's saying dinosaur dinosaur. and now i'm like should i interject and be like well dude. actually and so the security. guard tried to. ruin my day but he didn't do. it because i looked at my son. and i only realized that [ __ ] the only thing that matters is love security. guards can't ruin [ __ ] not for me. not when it comes. to love my baby. not when it comes. to bringing my son to. the [ __ ] la brea tar. pits dude okay and so i [ __ ] looked at the la. brea tar pits and then we went. to go watch a 3d. movie about ice age thought. it was going to. be cute and then realized there. were rabid [ __ ] direwolves trying to. [ __ ] take down woolly mammoths and [ __ ] going for their jugular and calvin. was watching it in 3d. so we left all good. but we left wasn't really something. that a twoyearold should. watch so we left um and then we went to. look at more dinosaurs. in the tar pits dude. it's crazy how there's just like [ __ ] tar. pits in hollywood in the middle. of hollywood is where like dinosaurs. died i guess is what they're saying. ah dinosaurs died in the middle. of hollywood like seriously. that's what you're trying. to tell me like dude. there were [ __ ] brontosauruses just chilling in waihou gay. ones you know just like roar. two gay brontosauruses just [ __ ] each other sucking their brontosauruses dicks dude. brontosaurus on his back no. a brontosaurus on his back. and then another brontosaurus doing it. missionary and the brontosaurus dick. flopping all over the place. upwards ah that's the stuff. i think about got probs dude. i never really realized that. when like gay guys have sex. like you could do it. i always imagined it was. doggy style but you can actually do. it when the guy's on the back. and then you're facing him. and then it's crazy because his dick. is everywhere right you don't ever really. think about that just flopping all. around if i do it i'd be in trouble. man i'd be knocking out [ __ ] chandeliers and [ __ ] my [ __ ] is large and in charge but it's all good dude that's not what we're here to. talk about right i'm talking about my son. in the la brea tarp it's great. cool great great um so yeah. so we went to. the [ __ ] la brea tarps and then it came back. and calvin [ __ ] took a nap in our room. they finished up and then we [ __ ] let calvin in and dude it's so cute. when he gets excited he goes. like this he's excited i want. him to only be doing that. for a little bit longer. though because when he gets a super oh if he gets older and he doesn't and it's like okay well does he have a problem okay anyway but it's awesome. that he does that dude. it's so cute and he goes right. to the dinosaur book it's like dinosaur. book and he goes out. of blue he just says ted. dactyl and we're like how did you even learn. that you don't have to. teach kids [ __ ] i didn't. know that i didn't know that. they'll just pick [ __ ] up i'm a firsttime. dad i didn't know that. they'll just pick [ __ ] up like he just was walking. around and saying oh [ __ ] i didn't know like i never taught him. oh [ __ ] he just goes oh [ __ ] and then he also [ __ ] was trying to. put something together and he couldn't put it together. and then he goes like this. dad i'd do it and i'm like how do you even. know that sentence so that. i did it anyway. dude talking about my son. too much um but yeah it was his birthday. he's over two now
