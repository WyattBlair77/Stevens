[music] i can't wait till this. podcast is ai honestly. and i just don't really have to. do [ __ ] uh it'll be a while though i think we've been doing this podcast now for how long has it been it's been 17 136 years. uh so uh and that's just how quick i am. at math right it's just how quick i i'm with math. um i bought a new scale. i bought an ey massager and i bought the other rent those are my amazon. purchases um amazon's crazy. kind of it's going i amazon's crazy. my son's 3 and a half. and he just will see something. on tv and he'll be like ooh let's get that. on amazon and i'm just like all. right you know i just realized actually. i have this here and i i don't know. why it must be because i was blowing. my nose but every time i um i have this. next to my bed. and the reason why i have this next to. my bed is because i wake up. with a dry nose. and i need to. blow it so i can. breathe that's why and i always think in the middle. of night when i do that. i wake up and i think man got to. get kleenexes because this seems like i'm i'm i'm squirting. right this this next to. my bed seems like i'm i'm i'm i'm in the j. files right i'm i'm i'm i'm i'm i'm going. spanking right i'm not though. dude it's for my nose it. really is for my nose. i don't use it for spanking. and every morning i wake up. 3:30 in the morning. i can't breathe take this. blow my nose and and every time. the cleaning ladies come over. i'm like dude they probably think that these are. for my spank files and they're not dude. and now i'm like why why is this. here i must have been blowing. my nose but anyway those you don't know what i'm holding. if i'm you're listening to. it i'm holding a roll. of toilet paper i just have it. next to my bed. like i'm some college student. you know but really i'm a 43y old. man with two kids sleeping. next to a wife i don't do. it okay yeah now do i sore. yeah but do i you know. i don't you know. i don't use that to. clean up i just kind of like rub. it on my underwear. and then go to. bed and roll over disgusting. but whatever dude it doesn't matter. you know it really doesn't matter. it does well it does matter. honestly because lately uh i have to. kind of i don't want to. talk about this okay honestly because it's disgusting. to talk about the pocket. to to start off with the squirting. monologue right um i mean for for christ's. sakes my parents listened to. this podcast great dude. and also it's immortalized forever. my son are going to. hear it great dude. billy just got his shots i don't. know what they vaccinated him. for something they put one in one. they dipped it on his mouth. and the other one on his leg. and i was holding him actually. kristen was holding him and i was right. there holding two kind of but she was doing. most of the holding i don't want. to take credit for it. and they just poked him. and he go he was smiling. dude he's such a smiley. baby he was just like this. and then he goes that's it. dude my sons get through. their emotions very quickly um and that'll probably uh probably be help. for them later uh i keep my walls up. i've kept my walls up for a. long time but let's not get into. it but yeah but then anyway the floods came crashing in and it's all good. my babies um yeah leave a message uh under here uh when's the last time. you cried i'd love to. know it when's the last time. you cried leave a message under the comments. uh leave a comment on the in the in the things. you know we say leave. a message and that's absolutely ridiculous. but um yeah cuz i'm a i don't know. boomer or whatever post posted. some clips going dummy viral. on some tik tok and instagram.

anger subsides cool all good anger. subsides that's how angry i get i'm also better. with my anger now okay now that's fine. the clip's over there it's doing. great so i'm thinking about my anger. i talk about my anger. on stage a little bit another. guy chimes in and i i get mad it's all. clip online but whatever i'm here talking. about anger so i get through. the whole weekend i do my hamilton show. holy [ __ ] it's gang busters. is all good he keeps his seats. warm but not too warm. because they stand up. you know what i mean. so um and we're going back. to the airport to. leave the airport in toronto. my driver is one. of those races where you're like i don't know. what race that is do. you know what i mean. like as a white guy. i'm i'm pretty sure all white. guys we know there's this. race out there where we're just like you got me. right like asians you can tell blacks. uh indians you get. it right now we can understand. samoens after like the last 10. years the rock and all that [ __ ] even though he's you know i don't know if he's samoan but like we get it right. whatever my driver is that's the white. guys we know what what i'm. saying he was that race. the race where you look. at him and you go what. the [ __ ] is that guy like a filipino or something but why does he not have the eyes. that they have right. okay whatever that race. is that's what the driver. is and i i i don't i'm not the kind of guy. that's like i don't see color. dude i see color. i recognize color i appreciate. it i respect it so i see the driver. on i go don't know what race. he is see it check it. respect it let's get up. in this suv we get up. in the suv all five of us. all right we're in the suv driving. to the airport now toronto's got one. of those airports that's in tonto. and then they've got the airport that's a little too. far and it's so annoying. that they have it there. and that's the one i'm getting. it out okay it's like pearson or something. i got to go. like 40 minutes but really it's 50. minutes and i'm [ __ ] driving out. i'm in the freeway in the car. whatever race the guy. is who's driving is driving all. of a sudden sam my videographer. working on my [ __ ] sam's computer. comes flying forward why because the driver. is screeching okay meaning we almost get into. accident meaning i'm like maybe the guy is filipino. right because asians always be crashing. but he's not though. i still don't really know. what a race he is. okay we almost screech i hear cuz here's the thing. when you're about to. get into an accident it's not the almost accident. that is going to. make you get in an accident. it's the afterwards right. because you're like i can handle this. i can handle this. i got this i got this i got this we stop and then after that it's up. to all these other knuckleheads behind you. to navigate and see what the [ __ ] is going. on to avoid you right. and those people aren't you and that means they're idiots. so you go like this and then you go let's hope for the best. there's nothing you can. do at that point you know. it's like in horror. movies when that [ __ ] stupid shot that they do where somebody opens the fridge. door looks in the fridge. and the music is happening. and then they close the fridge. and not and you know. either someone's standing there or they're not standing there. but they've done it so many times that you're like oh [ __ ] they're going to. close refrigerator door and it's going to. show a guy right. that's the same thing as waiting. for that accident you just kind of hope. for the best hopefully the guy. isn't there from the fridge. hopefully we're not going to. get hit in the back. so i hear and i'm like oh it's coming. closer [ __ ] brace yourselves and they just drive by okay. so i'm like wow we made it. out all good we continue driving we are at a zero. mile m hour thing then we start going again. then i hear more honking. then i look to. the left and then i see three people in that car. going like this to. my driver just [ __ ] flipping them. off like this like like big ones too. not you know how some people do it. like that they had their full fingers like that. just being like red as [ __ ] craziest thing. was no clue what race. they are okay so now i've got a fullon race. war with two races i don't. know what they are which is fine. but also the guy's super red because he's so mad so i don't even really know what color. he is so they're doing the thing. where they're like you know. trying to to the suv and my driver's going. like yeah yeah yeah yeah sorry. sorry whatever his accent. is my tour manager. in the back like just let him. go let him go guy. lets him go okay. so now they're in front of us. so now i'm like okay. it's probably over we're behind them. all good in front of us. window driving just like this. guys just driving like this. flicking the flipping the dude. off behind us my driver. goes like this the guy in the front turns. around i mean i've never seen. red like this and he goes. my driver goes like this. could you i would have if some body did that. to me i would have shot myself. in the head that is the most disrespectful. thing to do when somebody's mad. is to look at them. and go and he did that. the guy gets out of his car. walks over to our car and is so mad. and then spits on our. car walks back and drives away. and i was just thinking about it. man about how long that guy. was angry you know. he was angry for minutes. and not just angry. blood curling angry so i guess. what i'm saying is i'm pretty proud of myself. for just getting angry. and then letting it go i feel like that guy. was in a bad place. though you never know what people are going. through right like what if that guy just found out his dad you know got uh you know stabbed. in the [ __ ] eyes you don't know dude you don't know you don't know but the shows. in canada were awesome. hamilton is on fire right. didn't stay there obviously because it's hamilton and it's 50. minutes away from toronto. and why would i stay in hamilton everyone. says it smells like piss didn't smell. like piss it's actually very nice um but toronto. is crazy awesome it's just crazy. awesome it's just crazy awesome. they got great shops and then you. know why they're awesome. because they have really good. shops next to. really shitty shops and you're like. you got to find them. so when you find a cool. place you're like oh yeah this is kind of extra. special just coffee shops you know. we stayed at that one. hotel which was really cool really nice i mean. they do this annoying thing. where it's like a lot. of is sustainable and we make stuff. furniture out of [ __ ] trees. and all that which i know. they do anyway like a lot. of furniture is made out of trees. but they make it a point. to let you know that. they're made out of like trees. and [ __ ] because they got like you know their unfinished wood. and like their bench. has like [ __ ] you know the like brown you know it'll be like a nice like uh like this color. desk but like they'll have the really brown. hole in it because there was a branch coming out. of the tree and you got to. be like oh this is great. and it says something like sustainable. on it and you're just like dude. i don't give a [ __ ] is it comfortable. you know ecofriendly i don't know. i don't think we should be ecofriendly if i'm honest. just live it up. you know what i'm talking. about live it up. we're on earth one shot no. yeah you got to. make it better for the generations to. come but here's the deal. everyone in the world is going. to [ __ ] it up for them anyway. you think the trees give a [ __ ] you know what i'm talking about you think think we're going to. get to the trees. getting back at us you think the ozone. layer is going to. deteriorate before some guy. hits the red button you know. what i'm talking about you think you. think that the co2 is. going to deplete. before some guy in some chair somewhere. just hits some [ __ ] button that blows up. half the world nah and then we get some dark. skies nah dude drink arrowhead bottled water. use lots of hairspray. don't buy electric you know. what i'm talking about we're all. going to get shot in the [ __ ] face anyway i'm a nihilist. but that's it whatever it is dude. i hope that calvin and billy are okay. here's the other thing. too we got other planets you. know you think that it's you think that we're not going. to be able to. move to one. of those planets [ __ ] you think we're not going to. be able to. go to mars i know it's real cold. or whatever whatever saturn maybe. it'll be [ __ ] up or what about that. ring i have a picnic legs. off you know what i'm talking. about like the
