know. it's like people are turning. this off because you look great. don't you worry you look. great thanks you know. what i i wore. this shirt because um i thought that uh i thought that uh it. was a good shirt to. wear and then i realized i think that i wore. this shirt on another time you were here. and i think that's the reason. why i wanted to. wear it and i think it subconsciously. messed me up in my heads. brains are weird huh. hey you want to. be uh you you brains. are weird right you're a therapist you're going. to be a therapist that's crazy. you don't want to. start me off immediately with some brain. talk let's talk no i don't let's let's talk some funny. stuff first the brain. stuff will come naturally because it's me so right. you'll start talking about your feelings. and stuff oh oh yeah hey and i'll make you take talk. about yours um okay. that's good sounds good and we're back. sorry i had to. take care of some family. business so um yeah you talk. about brains a lot yeah. and and and you don't need to. but you do you want to. it's all i can think about to. be honest so we were watching. a show the other day. about it's called dark. matter okay by the way you finished. it right yeah and did you love it. loved it at the end it. wrapped up really nicely. right i thought so i still didn't. like the thing yep i get it. i get it still and you said that. you were going to. give me an argument for it. i was but i'll do yeah. i don't want to. ruin it for everyone but uh i'll give you an argument. best you should just like it. you should just like it but anyway it. doesn't matter uh what what does matter. is we were watching the show. and in the show uh a there's somebody that gives somebody. else uh a certain type of ice. cream that they're allergic to. it because they let's just say. forget that they're allergic to. it right goes to. the hospital the wife comes. and it's like you forgot or so what. happened is he okay. she comes in is he okay. and he says yes and she says well what happened. and he says i just i forgot. i forgot about the allergy. and she says you just forgot. okay well okay you just forgot. that right like that's kind of how she does. it and then they sit down together. and we both thought the same. thing yeah okay why. don't you explain what we. thought and then i'll explain. what what what we thought. even though it's the same. thing uh i thought wow this. is he should blame her that's what should have. happened he should have blamed. her and uh or she should have blamed. him right she should have blamed. him is what i'm saying. right she should have blamed. him i said oh wow. that's what a healthy person. does in a crisis. they they come in and even though. someone made a mistake and in this. case the mistake resulted in. someone getting pretty sick mhm almost dying. the wife still wasn't like what. the [ __ ] yeah she was like okay and she was just there for her husband and they could deal with the problem. together but that husband was an idiot for doing that. well that's but that was like the least. idiot thing that he needed to. do okay so you think that was the least. idiot thing that he what that he did. what just come on the micophone me. yeah talk in the microphone. turn it so if you're going to. look at him like this. like it i'm so sorry. are you evil i. did not mean to. do that i'm really sorry. it's okay you can keep in that. he's evil people need to. know but the directional needs to. go okay i'm so sorry. i how's your how's your finger. babe how's your finger it's fine. you don't want to. give guys ammunition to. pop boners off by doing that. guys are going to. do that no matter what guys going. to be guys huh. well if if there's a thing some guy is sexually attracted. to it true butterflies. in a forest well now guy. jacked off to it. one time okay well um the butterf um so uh that's something i'd like to. talk about i got to. walk home well but what about how what about how hold on before. we can talk about remember that. but we could we can talk. about how you think mistakes. just happen like weather yeah yeah honestly. [ __ ] my mouth that means i disagree hard. disagree dude mistakes she'll be. like hey it's a mistake. somebody made a mistake that's where you're just. like nah but you think like mistakes. are a thing in the ether. that just happened i don't think that. i think that okay okay. we we here so i think that we all. have it out brains some are really good. at some things and some are not so good. at others and i think that we're generally if we're good. people trying to selfreflect and better. ourselves are trying to. better those parts of our. brain that are not doing so hot. and in my case because of add i will. leave things and forget um i have to. go to great lengths. to organize and manage my life. which you're actually good at i put systems in place. put system place but if i make a mistake. i don't think that um blaming and yelling. and so when i getting upset. is the way to. and then when i make a mistake. you don't even really care a. lot like or you you. care if it's a you you don't. care if it's like whoops. i spilled this no i care. if it's like intentional like if i ask you to. do the dishes and you say yeah. and then that's not a mistake. though to me that's just fault. period okay sure i said i was going to. do it and i didn't do it. right but like for instance. the other day you in fact. here we go you had a cup. of iced coffee on. the rug with our kid. kids mistake number one yep. cuz obviously we have a oneyearold. and it's spilled and i just hear oh god. and i was like it's okay. i'll go get a a it was so dumb. but who but okay i'm mad. at it i'm still mad. at me for doing it. i actually think i have the solution. oh jesus christ you should know. this because you're an addict okay. is the way to. correct behavior shaming and yelling. at people into oblivion no. dude for instance my therapist said that. she didn't start or she didn't. stop smoking cigarettes until she was like she had like a moment. with herself that she was like honey it's okay. i'm with you and you're better. than this and so she's two people she's an insane. person no i i'm kidding. she's great so uh all right. fine um now should we tell everyone. what happened with the with the reason. why we brought this up. like the the spoon it i mean. that would be the third. time that we' have gone. over it we've gone over. it i don't know maybe let's leave that really why. you tell a short version. of it and i won't interrupt you or do. you want me to. do it this seems like a trap. it's a trap it's a trap. i real i didn't even realize it. it's a trap for either. of us no matter what happens. we're going to rehash it's but we but i think we dealt with it. and it's okay mhm you can. go ahead and explain this. why i have this tattoo cuz billy has a morning. spoon that she drinks her. coffee and then stirs it. gives him the spoon. every morning and is you know sometimes. the spoon is somewhere we find it. inside oh yeah look this. is a spoon and it's cute. we have a balcony uh under that. balcony there's cars okay so i say well. hey make sure that billy doesn't bring anything. out on the balcony that you could throw onto. the car and make it dent. which i have been yeah. no she says yeah i get [ __ ] happens well i'm in charge of making sure that none of the little cars. that he likes to. bring out aren't out there. and i feel like i've been doing a pretty good. job well i mean there's always cars. down there but that's just going. to happen that's just going. to happen exactly it's just going. to happen sweetie this. the the car the cars. don't make a d well this. one made a d the cars. don't make a dent on the cars. cuz the cars. are plastic and they're just hot. wheels now silver spoons. on the other hand when they hit a windshield. can can actually dent can actually crease crack. the crack the windshield. right crease the crack the windshield. yep okay now did it. yes okay uh now it i will. say she took care of her spoon. already but this was a spoon. from another day that she that. got out some and i i get that happens. we have big chairs and so things. go under the chairs we the biggest chairs in the world. i've never seen bigger chairs they're so expensive. every couple days i look under the chairs and i find two. colored pencils a spoon. some goldish um her long lov. brother treasure yeah and so uh anyway uh i couldn't think of another. thing it was too. late to say that. what i was clown toxic. crusader anyway um so you hear i'm not there. she hears you hear kink. you go oh no but i say oh no. not my windshield's broken i say oh no. chris is going to. be star raving m all right. so so it happens. you steal my own. upsetness from me okay because your emotion. is so elevated no. i'm like [ __ ] what's his name from the from the avengers. that takes that pain from you. and you're welcome i take the pain. i don't know no i mean. thanos could i don't think it was thanos. yeah thanos could probably do. that but i was talking more. about the red guy. but whatever it doesn't matter. what what i'm saying is um so she tells me that. it happens later on that. day and and and it was very the way. she said it she says hey just billy dropped a spoon. i know it's annoying i'm sorry. the the um it hit the windshield. it and there's like a very tiny. crack i go like this. oh okay you could barely notice. it and she say yeah. it's at the bottom it's all good. dude i i take that i take it. to the bank i don't even i don't. even go i don't even. go look which is crazy. for me i i just go. okay you said what you said. all good all right now. i uh 30 minutes later i say. to you right no. the next day no no no no no no no. no before that 30 minutes. later maybe 30 minutes later right 20 whatever doesn't matter i like to. be specific go ahead who cares. okay that's a that's how many a certain amount of time. later i say to. her you know what i'm making a. lot of progress with the way. i i deal with things like you told me. that there was a crack on the windshield. and i didn't even really care. honestly i'm not mad i'm really. dealing with it great and my immediate. thought was oh [ __ ] he is going. to absolutely bring this. up again and not. only is he going to. to be as mad. as usual he's going. to up at a notch. and guess what folks. hold on no no. no no no no no that's not true. the second you said that. i was like oh god. i got to the second. i said that here's how well i know. you the second i said that. the second i said that. i knew that she thought that and i thought so now i have to. be on my double best. behavior because i know she's ready. for me to absolutely. bring the rain down the next time. we come up so hopefully. it doesn't come up again. okay so she said you know. what you don't deserve extra. credit for that all good. who cares you know. keep it to. yourself but not not in a rude. way what yeah i mean. a version of that. but really like like okay. yeah and so the next day. uh a new day. right as uh who's that selen dion would say or whatever. um i'm just on the patio. just cuz it it just because i happened. by happen stance in boxers and glasses. for all the neighbors to. see you're welcome for that. too and whoopsie i looked. over a scratch is someone. knocking yeah common sense. because it wasn't a scratch. it was what the [ __ ] did somebody put a did somebody put a a one of those bullet. hole stickers dude it was you. know what it was they shot the unbreakable. poster on the on the [ __ ] on that windshield. that's what they did the unbreakable. poster it just it. was this okay and i say i'm shocked because she said a small. thing so and and now by no. means is this a small crack. i mean by zero means. nobody ray charles could be a block. away and be like what's up. with that big crack on. that windshield okay helen keller would be in the attic. somewhere like you know what i mean. this crack is large. so i say that's a little crack. like i'm so confused okay. and he said it in i said it. in that way yeah okay. so now she looks uh over the balcony and she sees it. and she says oh no that's not the crack. and i say what and she says that's not. the crack and i say okay. she says that's like a like a cobweb or something else like that. i don't know whatever. we saying and i and she said cuz i had driven the car. the day before and i knew that. that was and she says wait. a minute uh oh the crack. got much bigger yeah now. that's fine that that now. let me tell you what some. a not fault that's no. one's fault the fact. that there was a crack and then it got bigger that's you. know you can't you assume that's going. to happen but a little piece of you. thought she lied no. i didn't think you lied. actually es well you you cleared. up quick you're like it must have gotten. bigger i didn't think you lied. i i i knew you. were telling the truth. so i say like oh oh oh well that. got that got really big and she looks at me. and when she looks at me. i know congratulations it's over. because it's i can't i've held all. i can hold and the levies. just like the blood from uh the the shining in the ele. in front of the elevator sh. here it just like this. tea kettle and she and i go. oh oh well okay well we got to. get that fixed then god. okay well all right are we going. to drive that now can we can drive and and and it's it's off. it's off it's off it's off the rails. dude and she was right. i did get mad again. and but i didn't get mad at it. happening hand to. god i got mad because i saw your face. and i knew you thought i was mad. now that's so deep dude. that is the inception of madness. like we are like so levels. deep and we discovered all. this today in couples therapy. yeah and we can't get out. of it y we can't get out. of it no i'm not. saying we can't get out of the argument. we just can't get out. of that intricacy of dude. it's so insane man and then and then you got upset. and then i got up more because i was bracing. because i've had seven years. of like the smallest things. making you so so angry and i should clarify. the anger is never like directed. necessarily at me i've never called. name never yelling. but it's like he's this. tornado i'm also a guy you're a woman. so it's different like if i come in and i'm like what. the [ __ ] happened here it's like it's not the energy that most women have so it's like yeah it seems combative. and [ __ ] you also like to. drag it on and like continue the conversation and get really specific about we're talking about it now on a podcast. right but uh we did get we did. get for sure pasted it it. was great in couples therapy. and um oh my god i want to. tell i want to. tell them something all right. so before coup's therapy i probably. don't want this that's fine. you can cut it right. no it's fine before coup's. therapy chris gets really nervous yeah. and a funny thing that i've noticed is every time. that we're about to. go to coup's therapy. he's like why am i so anxious. this week it must be because i'm like going. to the he says that every single time. and i'm i just realized that today. actually because we have couples therapy. in like yep but he sat. down and he was like cracking his. knuckles and like breathing deeply. and so i just put on i put on a celtic music [ __ ] relaxation um uh it's celtic it's larry bird. isn't playing the [ __ ] mandolin it's celtic music celtic music and it was of this like fairy castle. and it had all these birds. flying and little butterflies. flying around and i was and he like closed. his eyes and we both. just kind of i did something. that i didn't even want to. do i don't normally breathe. through it i i i imagined. i was like all right. let's get center let's center. our i don't think about i don't even think this way. but anyway go ahead. yeah so and we're both just waiting. for our therapist to get on zoom. and i look and these little butterflies. are like floating around. and i was like i was like imagine this unbelievable. imagine now that you're just. one of those butterflies floating. around you don't have to. eat eat or drink or think. about anything it was a little more poignant. than that you said i said just butterflies. yeah the only thing what isn't that. crazy about a butterfly like the only thing. they think of the only thing they have to. do is just fly around. and be butterflies and just yeah have fun. yeah i was like imagine you're one. of those mhm and i don't think much. of it cuz i'm i have my eyes. closed and i'm just you know. breathing and then i look over. and just water works. dude i couldn't the celtic music okay all right. fine i don't want to. listen to it period. but if you're going to. put it on fine. i can think this stupid music. but also i get it. it's music is nice a little bit. you're going to start. talking about like the lifespan of a butterfly. during that dude i can't so i started. crying so congratulations you did. that to me yeah. and normally normally i feel like i'm like oh baby. it's it's okay and today was like jesus. she laughed at it. i couldn't i couldn't i couldn't dude. it's you can't do the both. of those things before coup's. therapy while i'm anxious we're going. to talk about uh uh uh you know. the life of a butterfly and how how how how they don't have any responsibilities. and then i got to. start thinking about how like i have responsibilities. in no way is my life. like a butterfly i have i have calvin. i have billy i have you i have my parents. they're getting older i have you know other problems. going on that i never even. mentioned on the podcast ass. that nobody [ __ ] knows about and i'm like you know about and i'm i'm like okay we got to. [ __ ] deal with this [ __ ] and then we're at couple cy i'm like what should i bring up. we only have an hour. and then so i'm all these things and i'm looking at this. [ __ ] goddamn butterfly just flapping its wings around. uh a castle that. doesn't exist and i'm like well. [ __ ] man this that would be so don't mince my words. that would be so dude. don't mince my words here that. would be so gorgeous if that would if that. was my life in a way. right okay instead of oh we're moving oh we have this. oh uh i have to. worry about that oh the you know. uh health scare this almost hit that. guy on the freeway you know. what i mean and it's like dude. some jackass butterfly is just no. not jackass well whatever it's only alive for like 6. days right so [ __ ] it and don't touch them or else they can't ever fly again. it's a raw deal but i'm just saying you. know what it is it's butter. fantastic get out get out and don't ever come. back to this podcast. you can't say that you can't. say butter fantastic jesus. christ shame her um yeah so that was what our day was and it was nice it was it was good it. was our couple's therapist is like a magician. because he has a really long twisty. mustache and it's uh and a top hat. and um and and a sparkly. cake [music] uh but yeah i don't you know. yeah it's good he's good so anyway. that's what happened today. and it's fine and we're good but uh you. know you think mistakes just happen. like the [ __ ] wind and they don't there's somebody somebody's at the root cause of that. and we got to. figure it out do we cuz at the end. of at the end of couple's. therapy that was pretty much the opposite. of the conclusion the guy's always going. to lose no matter what because of his dick. and balls right because women's got lumps on. their chest bab he's a guy. he's a guy he wasn't the one. giving you the advice and he gets it. dude he goes like this. well which was one one with the lumpy chest. uh you in and that's what i know. dude but he's i got this big dick. and balls we can't. win so let's dear jesus. please help our couples therapist never see this. amen i love him. so so much please don't let him. drop this i highly doubt. that we're in his algorithm. on youtube you never know. you never know um so anyway. so i we already said i we didn't want. to talk about brains but you did. talk about brains we've been talking about brains. well you asked me i. did and you were the one. that said you wanted to. tell the story mhm deeply about brains. so who is the who is the lumpy chest. now no hong kong no that's assault. that's assault so um yeah so then uh all right. okay so i i go to. australia tomorrow okay uh and i am going to. be gone for two weeks. okay and then you're gonna come meet me. there in a week that's cool. it'll be cool to. have a vacation with no. kids just us um yeah i'm renting kids. out there so we're going to. have them with us you know. what's so change his diaper. ridiculous is like i know that. that's what a ridiculous thing to. say still the piece of me. like i had like a pit on my stomach like oh no. we had to tap it's not. going to be did the mother. thing kick it and be like oh okay. i'll take care of it. kind of yeah oh wow. dude that's crazy they don't exist. those kids i know um so yeah grandma. kiki's coming uhhuh your mom to. watch the babies she's gonna be so excited billy looks. like her yeah it's really weird. it's really cute uh calvin. looks like my side and billy looks like your side. whatever uh and it's all good. what you know did you come prepared. or did you want to. say something yeah i want to. talk about the sex industry dude. everyone turn this off this. a private conversation with me. this is what i've been thinking really deeply. about oh god so we have this. giant sex industry right please and. obviously women are a part of it. in the sense that men. are paying women to. get sexual favors men. are paying men to. get sexual favors check please. but here's the thing and this is like when people say. that men and women. are basically the same and it's just like all a bunch of fooy mhm. women just straight up don't participate. in the sex industry in terms of being like the customer women. aren't just like going on skid r. like night after night. cuz they can't stop and like getting getting guys. to like sleep with them. they but isn't that crazy. that there's this huge [music]. that was a good dinner. huh yeah check please but you know. what i'm saying oh yeah okay. see okay honey babe i i would think that you would think this is really interesting. let's have some breakfast that's how far gone. this conversation is you know. what we could do instead. oh check please let's have a fist. fight oh well me and you yeah. no no no all right let's go. back to what you were saying. so women don't really participate. in it but your but it's just this. crazy like undercover it's like. the drug industry obviously like both. genders freely use like cocaine. and all the other stu. girls do coke off. a guy's dick sometimes. not me didn't happen. to me i never did. it right but it's happened. mhm it it has happened. yep and women just straight. up don't participate yeah. no i know isn't that crazy. it is crazy yes it is absolutely. crazy and it is wild. and uh but like okay. so you have this thing what does. that say to. you about the differences in genders women. will never understand so there's no positive. from this of like well that's good women. don't they aren't drawn to. that like well if women were drawn to. that if women were drawn to. sex like men were drawn. to sex yeah i pro. you probably wouldn't be with me. you know what i mean. you'd be with like a brad. pit or something why because of how brad pit. looks oh you're saying it's a visual. thing it's the only fans is a visual. thing baby you're so handsome. thank you thank you very. much no but it's just it's just i mean. i'm i'm i'm you know. in in the right lighting i kill. but in the wrong lighting oh my god. i'm uglier than the worst. person i love you in the wrong. lighting i like you when you look that's beautiful. thing to say the. way that you think look. bad i love you in the wrong. lighting i love you. even when you think you look. bad um yeah i just i think that uh okay. fine that's fine but but but sex. is so weird it's so weirdly different. between men and is as it. is in women i want to. know so bad i just want. to be in a male brain. for one day i want to. know you don't i just check please. i want the insight it's so baffling to. me because there's so many different. personalities of men yet. when it comes to. this one subject they generally. all have the same feeling yeah. no but it's like generally like yeah. we want it like way. more than girls do and it's a whole other thing. that you guys just don't really understand. no there are there are levels. to it though like i you know i remember i had a conversation. with one of my buddies. and this was god almost a decade. ago and who uh i i don't know if i should talk. say it no i'll just tell you after david sullivan. so i was talking to. him and i said um oh he snorted. bab and i said that's okay. and i said uh and i said uh man. it's crazy how much like i think about sex. all the time huh. and not crazy that we do that. and he said yeah and i was like you think about sex. all the time and he was like no. and i was like you you uh well so like if you meet a woman. you don't think uh of her as like i i look i know. she's a person but also you're judging her. looks and he was like uh no not right. away and i was like i'm sorry. he was like yeah i don't i was like so you don't immed immediately. think i wonder if i'd have sex. with that woman when you meet her. and he said no and i was like i'm sorry. and uh he's such a good. guy that was when i that was when i realized that. well first of all number one. i had a problem and number two it's way. different from guy to. guy cuz i didn't know that. i thought men are just walking. around like gth what's his name. halgar swing swing like with [ __ ] uh wayne's world yeah yeah is it halgar alar algar okay wow pretty close wow um
