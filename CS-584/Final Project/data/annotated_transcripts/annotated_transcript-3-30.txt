you saw this i know this so listen this. is crazy a canadian. go ahead a canadian. school board is quote standing behind a trans. teacher who sparked protests after turning. up to classes with giant. prosthetic breasts big round processes. uh some students have been skipping. classes as students and parents. alike don't think it's quote normal. and expect the school to. step in and put a stop to. this now i can end this. right now tits are too big. dude prosthetic or not make them. smaller this is unbelievable dude. talk about the down step. sloping i mean you take a down. step this [ __ ] hits planes yeah. well the thing i uh here's what when i was reading. about it i didn't really it. didn't really land in my mind. the way it seems to. be landing in other people's minds. it's become like a trans activist. thing but like trans or not. it has nothing to. do with trans or not. them taters are way too. [ __ ] big and the nipples are too pointy at a school. that's just kind of like inappropriate. yeah you dude also trans. people right now see this. and they're like this oh my god. right it's not a good it's not. good for them and they know. it you know this is this. is just a bad stupid. thing that's like a side. show it's actually a south park. episode i think also they're prosthetic you're like you don't even. really have them like you definitely take them. off when you get home. are they not implants they're prosthetic. it says which means that they're he puts. them up she i don't know. she puts them on if they're prosthetic then they're not they're not implants. right the best is they probably ties them. around the neck you know she teaches workshop. and they got woodwork and [ __ ] i saw videos yeah it looks like she's gonna [ __ ] cut her titty off because it's so big yeah you know she got two of them too so it's not even just one um but yeah i i it's not a trans issue it's not a [ __ ] uh sensitivity issue in any way it's just a plain bottom line let's be real about it them taters are so funny that like her cut me off at the very end well the taters are too big okay but it's so funny that like she's like at her desk and it's just like she's knocking papers over and [ __ ] and like knocking over like [ __ ] there's a compass sticking out of it and she doesn't even feel it because it's a great [ __ ] she's got a peek over her dick yeah she's like let me guard your paper she goes like this with her titties double d yeah yeah [laughter] uh all right well get rid of it and saw him off my wish. my issue with this is that the school. board is being so careful. of course they are and they're missing. the point yep you don't have to. be careful like if this. was a cis woman that would also be an issue. yeah hey excuse me uh ma'am. cis woman your real titties. they're too big no i'm saying. if someone came in with the big giant vest. of titties on okay yeah the vest. of titties vest of titties starring bruce. willis uh it's just not. it's school yeah it's not. yeah it's it's not it's beyond. normal it'd be great. it's just [ __ ] like such a distraction. it'd be great if it like a a a a guy had like such a large. [ __ ] and it was like so big in his pants and he was like and he was like drawing on a chalkboard and [ __ ] it was so distracting and then he would turn around every time he turned around there was like a little bit of chalk. on it because it rod though. against the blackboard why are you talking. about me in front of all. these people so dumb i had it. locked and loaded the whole. time all right um all right. so yeah so cut your titties. off whoops oh just leave the vest. of titties at home and just be a regular ass. teacher yeah dude all right also i love how all the students. they interviewed a bunch of students. and they were like oh we don't really care. yeah that was the best. part yeah so but if the students. don't care leave the rest. of titties on i guess. who knows you know yeah. all right all right yeah cool. i think we have another one. uh oh we got another one. the new monarch king charles was. shown signing a visitor's book. in front of cameras at hillsborough. castle near belfast he reacted uh after. the he reacted after the pen. he you he was using. leaked on him he was seen. saying quote oh god i hate this. end quote i can't bear this bloody thing dot dot dot every stinking time. he had problem with the pen. oh yeah i saw this. video did you see. the video no it was so [ __ ] the way he was being well of course it was i mean i know god i hate this. how do you not know. you're being there's a video being taken. if you're in right well here's the deal. there has always been cameras on him. but now especially so he should have been ready. for this moment and the whole excuse. of like well he's just like getting his bearings [ __ ] 73. dude right he's been waiting. for this for the last 30. years just waiting for his mom. to finally die. yeah and in the first week. he's just like this [ __ ] pen [ __ ] you know what. i mean this is why. i like him now i know i like him. honestly whatever to. the whole monarchy thing everybody's so up. in arms one way or the other people. either love the whole thing. or [ __ ] like are so angry. about the whole thing yeah it. has no power anymore. it's a [ __ ] figurehead position. whatever the guys get brought so much money. i mean charles specifically has brought so much. money to charity and [ __ ] whatever dude get off his back. but anyway it was so [ __ ] so be less [ __ ] so [ __ ] about this [ __ ] cameras are always on you if a pen malfunctions just laugh it off dude yeah yeah exactly don't blow up in front of cameras yeah all right okay cool all right well let's take some [ __ ] let's do the videos that was great the real things yeah the real videos that videos that people call uh send in to. do this [ __ ] remember lifeline live we're going to. be taking your phone calls and zoom. in with you guys uh get tickets. to that under this video. go ahead october 19th it's a [ __ ] [ __ ] hey man thank you belly. here i am from the netherlands. and i noticed actually you never had a video. from the netherlands before but i want. you to know here also we are very. big fans of the podcast. yeah and my question is i have a girl. that i've been seeing for a couple. months now and i love her. and i want to. say this to. her but here in holland. it's more tradition for the girl. to say it the first time. wow okay um but she's not from here. so i don't know uh how i can kind of look. her into burns movie. um saying it to. me and then i say it. back obviously so any help would be great. thank you a movie make up. a story about a friend of yours. that is from holland and he started. dating a girl who didn't know the customs and he and he was like what she didn't. know was that she because the custom here is that. the woman says i love you. first and then pause and then say what do you think about that. isn't that crazy yeah yeah. isn't that crazy what do you think about that. and then say do you have anything of your own. that you want to. say about would you like to. add anything to. our lives yeah um i think no way. dude yeah just say you love. her no listen you're gonna. dry it up what you. got to be cool. you gotta be sexy you got to. be assertive and you got to. be like i know i don't know if you know this but in holland it. is very custom for a woman. to say to. the man they love them. first uh i know you are not from. here i also don't give two.

[ __ ] some serious trouble. uh including wars you know. there you go uh but it doesn't tradition. doesn't directly lead to. the war automatically you know what. i'm saying you're actually killing people. if you don't tell her you love her. but the truth the bottom line. of about the advice is and we agree. we don't always agree just. tell her you love her. yeah also that guy's [ __ ] handsome handsome. i think it was hand. okay all right there's a beautiful. good looking guy in hand. all right next one big fan. of podcasts love you guys. um so me and my man's. recently got married. because he's a military man. and he got orders somewhere else. and in order for us. to be together we needed to. be married or else he'd have to. live on a boat wow. so okay long story short we're also in love but long story short. we're married and my parents. have been very supportive and loving. and my mom told me. that my brother said that. i'm not making the right. choice he's older than me. and my sister told me that this is a mistake. and i'm too young and she's younger. than me and it just really sucks. not to have like my full family. support and i just i don't know. if i should reach out to. them or if i should just let it. be and just live my best. life what do you guys. think oh cute cute uh was that coming. out of her that dog i i think she was giving birth. i think that uh your parents. gotta be that's the thing. about love man it's blind. whether you like it or not. this may be the greatest idea in your life. it may be the worst. idea in your life but your family. has to support you through. it they have to. support you they have to. say look if this is what you're gonna do. this is what we think but if this is what you're gonna. do i'm gonna shut up and i'm gonna [ __ ] just be there for you and you know you married. you gotta remember who you love. and i don't know how young you are to. know how old he is you can't. not marry someone because your family. doesn't like that person though. no not something right. you do yeah okay. yeah i thought you were saying. that that no need to. support to be able to. marry no no no no i'm saying. the family this is advice. for the family oh you got to. support her got it okay. yeah um what's the boat. thing i don't know about that. i don't know but something it. made it she made it sound like the married. men yeah can be all nonboats oh well i don't yeah but yeah thank god. also made him a [ __ ] salad also how about this dude say this to. your sister your sister says you're too young. to get married say well. you know what you're younger. than me you're too young. to even know what the [ __ ] i'm doing in my life. how about that you're too. young to make a decision. if i'm too young to. make a decision guess. who's even too younger and too. young to make a decision. you and you're also trying to. do it on my life. i rest my case spin move. out of there dude. is her sister younger she just she said. the sister was younger yeah. what the [ __ ] does she know. dude uh yeah man i i think uh you got to. do what you want to. do it's beautiful you're in love. it's hard enough to. find somebody out there. especially these days during these weird. times um it's great you're doing it. right yeah don't have any regrets if it doesn't work. out it doesn't work out just it's not like you [ __ ] up though if it doesn't work out you tried it you're in love that's the most important thing she said in that video yeah we're in love you're in love [ __ ] try to. make it work if it doesn't work it's nobody's fault. it's just [ __ ] life yep next one. hey chris and matt mouth. doesn't move my name. is joe not moving on i'm calling in today. to ask for advice. strapped in and things to. say to a friend. who thinks every girl wants to. [ __ ] oh the worst you know he says it about girlfriends of our friends no dude it just makes me feel like whenever i get a girlfriend what are you gonna say about her you know is this guy calling about me. it's just kind of weird. and no you know. it's a hard thing because there aren't many things. you can tell to. a guy like that without hurting. his feelings yeah that's true. fragile ego any advice. would help i'd love to. hear your guys take on it. you know i love the show. and uh yeah wow thanks. i mean you know all right. dude well first of all you're right. that not every woman wants to. [ __ ] this guy so all you really have to. do is say hey you know. like if it bothers you enough. i mean it would bother. me i've had friends like that that do that and they definitely don't realize they're doing. it they don't think if you ask them. point blank does every woman. want to [ __ ] you they would say no right well every time someone yeah shows up in their life they say it so in effect. they do face by case. basis but every case. yes yeah exactly yeah so uh i think what. uh you would want to. say is like hey you know. like you say that a lot. almost about like every woman. that crosses like comes into. our life like you know. like women have taste like why. do you say that. about every woman like one of these women. at least is bound to. not actually when i'm sexy. so what's up hmm that the format. is a question don't be like hey [ __ ] you know. what you do yeah no just be like yeah. no it's actually agree with them. every single time agree. with them yeah i'd be like dude. yeah it actually is crazy. she really did want to. [ __ ] you and what's what's crazy is i'm realizing is that every girl that we run into. absolutely wants to. [ __ ] you and then he'll be back on his feet and he'll be like so what do you think yeah he'll know secretly he does it. too much and he'll stop doing it. you think so i do i don't know if i'll stop thinking it. but it's also he does. here's the thing biological biologically men. have to think that because that's what makes them. pursue women no nobody pursues a woman. more than a guy who thinks that uh she likes them. because and that's biological you have to. think that women like you otherwise you wouldn't. try as much and we need to. perpetuate our species nothing. is more important than correctly reading. the room that that is true. but not when it comes to. perpetuating our species specifically then. you don't want to. be a creep that like hits. on every [ __ ] woman because he thinks every woman. most rapidly you don't but when it comes to. humanity and moving our. species forward that's what we need yeah maybe he knows it [ __ ] cavemen but it's 20. 22. i know but we still have. that midbrain activated like. hey man ah yes he's smart. and figured it out. dude wow so unbelievably annoying. it's annoying but it's true. you are being not what you were. saying even when it's cold. in a hard way you are. being is so annoying and truthful. annoying truth continue okay. continue so i think that uh uh i think that yeah i think that you should just completely agree. with him about that all the time. that's a lot of work though. not really it's also you're gonna have more fun with it. you're pissed off and it's so annoying. yeah and you're gonna if you just agree. with them at least you have like an inside. joke with yourself what's up. with this friend though like i remember when i had a friend like that. i was like i don't like this. guy really and then i would stop being friends. with them i like them a lot. and one of the reasons was because of that. because it was so funny. to me really and i'd be like bro. you always think i'd be like no i don't but like all right. all right but he's uh yeah different. strokes you know yeah takes all kinds you know. what i'm saying um it's pretty. vague but yeah yeah all right. cool so next one so close. so hey chris and matt what's up. greetings from germany love you. guys i hope you guys are doing. well oh yeah um there's this thing i've been thinking about for a long. time now and it's the fact. that i'm 21. look at his eyes. and when people ask. me if i want to. have kids in the future. my answer is always no but not because i don't want. to have kids in fact. i would love to. but i just feel like the world. is kind of shitty man. yeah and it's not life. because life rips of course and it's beautiful. but um i feel really good oh man. kids are just addicted to. their phone they are having all these mental. health problems you know not to. be dramatic also but the rainforests they are dying. the oceans the animals man. i don't know what's gonna happen. in the next hundred years. maybe wars because of clean water. man i don't know yeah. and it's not like i'm planning. to have kids anytime soon. because like i said i'm 21. but i feel like if i keep this. mentality um not many women. in the future will want to. stay with me because what if they want to. have kids yeah right. you know so since of course um chris you had a kelvin pretty recently. i'm wondering if that's something you guys. have ever thought about absolutely if this. fear is reasonable yeah would love to. hear your answer love you. guys bye you're the most. attractive man i've ever yeah. he's so beautiful uh inside and out. too not has nothing to. do with his looks well he is beautiful. i know but besides that okay. you want to. go first or what i've actually thought that. uh recently a lot. because you're responsible to. not think that at least. think about it yeah yeah i mean i see calvin. and it brings me such joy. and i would i of course wanted. to have him we planned. on it and we had him. and he's the love of our lives. um uh no offense. to matt you know because i've known matt. much longer but you know no it's all good. you know it happens well life goes. on and what are you gonna. do yeah yeah so um i just think that uh it's it's it. i i do i think be careful. feeling that because you know. it's such an overwhelming feeling. if that's what you decide find decided and let it go. but like that's a tricky thing. that could lead you into. all sorts of like uh emotional. turmoil i mean that's the world. is [ __ ] but the world's always [ __ ] the world's always been [ __ ] it's actually right like in a lot of ways it's better. than it's ever been so uh you know. every generation if you talk. to them they're like oh this. is [ __ ] i thought about it today dude. i'm over there i gotta i gotta i got a coffee. and i go to. the thing and there's i was like where the straws. is over there and the goddamn paper. straws and i'm like this. is so [ __ ] annoying that we got to. deal with this [ __ ] and then i'm the old guy saying this about this generation. and or and it's it's always that. like my parents did it his parents. did it hey the world's going. to [ __ ] um and i don't know man. i mean like deciding. to not have a kid. because of that reason is a pretty if that's the reason. i'm not saying it's not a reason. but just quite the hard. line to take yeah i mean. it's definitely i think it's it's a sign. of uh more responsible person. the person who thinks this through. as a consideration as an as for having kids. or not i think a lot. of people choose to. not have kids and that is one. of the big reasons and if you so choose. then that is fine. everybody's everybody their decision. to have them or not is. [ __ ] fine i hate people who are like you have to. or like it's so there. are people out there. who are like you are being so irresponsible. to have a child and that is such a first. world thing is responsible to. what to happen the future. because of the [ __ ] environment i mean birth rates. are down for the first time. ever but i mean in america. no in the world no not in third. world countries it's [ __ ] [ __ ] skyrockets oh okay and like i i uh but birth. rates in america are down birth. rates are wrong white. people are way way way down yeah. uh and the the the thing is though. none of that [ __ ] matters. you you need to. decide for yourself at the end. of the day you can't. make be making decisions. for the world ah yes if you personally care. that much about the environment then it. still is about you though. you can't be thinking about the world. you got to be thinking about yourself. and the things that may come how good you are. how good are you at. dealing with adversity like things like this. like the world may change but the world always changes. nothing is ever the same. from one generation to. another bad things might happen. and good things might happen. too you really don't know so you have to. think about this though. i mean you're 21. now so this doesn't matter but as you get to. be 31 41 you have to. start thinking about what the future. is going to be like for you. do you want children. in that future yeah and so like there's a lot. of different things you have to. think about yeah uh and either decision. is fine but you got to. just think it all the way. through which it sounds like you are. absolutely doing so uh and again. you're 21 you have so much. time so much time to. make these decisions but it it's good. that you're thinking about them. now and don't worry about it. but just keep thinking about it. you know yeah uh that's don't decide anything. yet though is what i would say. right now well you can't. because also it won't matter. like what you decide now when you're 31. you're gonna look back. on many many things and think wow i can't. believe i thought that and this. could very well be one yeah you know. what i mean yeah and also you're gonna have kids. because there's no way. i mean dude you know yeah. we definitely will clamor over. your sperm right because you are a physically. mentally emotionally top of the [ __ ] pyramid. in every way beautiful sexy. empathetic uh caring uh thank you wise. intelligent beyond your years you. are a [ __ ] specimen that every now it's embarrassing

jesus christ all. right next one chris and matt. what's up enjoy the show. very much chris i saw you in dallas. or saint grand prairie grand. prairie which he called it. um my questions about shaving. so i shave my arms because i'm working on. i don't know a full. sleeve of tattoos i think it. looks better when they're shaved. okay so you can seem better. um i also trim. up my chest and my stomach when it's pool. season nope um but people think it's weird. because i don't shave my legs. takes too much time. they're pretty hairy so i kind of have like a half. and half thing going on. not a huge deal to. me my wife likes my arms shaved. and my chest and stomach shaved. i also got to. keep you know the downstairs. trimmed up and looking nice. um but just wonder what you guys. think is it weird. that i shave half and not the other halfway. at all uh let it grow. yeah i guess let me know what you think. bro this guy's a good. looking guy if he just let it. go he would be [ __ ] so smoking let it go i mean the sleeves. i understand because it's like you want the tattoos to. show no i'm saying i understand. okay i wouldn't do it. yeah at least you're shaving. your chest come on yeah. what are you doing chester. is the thing dude. my question is do you want. to be smoking i mean. i he probably does want. to be smoking do you want. to be smoking or you want. to be a good looking dude. you're a good looking dude. bro you want to. be smoking let that [ __ ] go out and your girl bro. she thinks she likes it. bro she thinks she likes it. but when you come in like a [ __ ] beast. let her go away for two. weeks and then come back. and you come out here. just [ __ ] you got just straight up like you know puffed out here and just even let it grow and they'll do it she'll be like oh you're asking her when she's not ovulating. ask her when she's ovulated you know. ask her when she's ask her. when it's that time. when the eggs are dropping. ask her when it's that. time hey should i shave my chest. she goes i don't know me. bro i'm telling you man. keep the hair chest hair is. not a thing to. shave chester is a thing. to value and protect okay you don't get rid of it. to get rid of it. is a is a is it's a sacrilege. it is a it is a it. is a it is a sin. it is one of the ten. commandments if you're religious who's the eleventh. god said do not shave your chest. god said and that was when god came down to. earth and said ask him. when they ovulate him. oh ask him the three days. when they're ovulating sperm. lives for 48 hours i love that fact when they when you when you splurt. your nut batter inside of them. it needs to be a day. earlier than the three days. or the sperm will die. don't ever say nut. batter again okay it's better. than sperm which is what your sperm. is like the actual you're not [ __ ] bill. nye dude not batter is what people in fraternities. say in like the midwest. bro check it out come visit my room. i have a black light. in it when you turn the black light. on you can see the nut. pattern all over my sheets. absolutely not going to hell. going to hell oh. yeah yeah dude yeah all right. well yeah ask him when they're ovulating. leave the leg hair leave the chest hair arm hair. or whatever do your [ __ ] thing that you want. to do about the tattoos but uh also shave this that. maybe it has to. go yeah that's a that's a terrible. yep the soul patch oh no has to. go has to stay has to. stay has to stay. whatever you want i hokey pokey do the hokey pokey a baseball. a third base coach. all right cool next what's up. chris and matt how do you like the show. my name john and uh i'm from south. africa but obviously i'm sure. chris probably picked that up already. with his incredible right. the radar accent skills. um so i have a little thing that i've always worried. about well not worry your penis. just one i was gonna say. um whether i'm actually being a dick. or not but when someone dies. oh and people you know they post. things on facebook or instagram. or whatever or social media. you know that's fine. that's their way to. grieve you know they're it's an outlet for them. to to to release some of their grief. you know and i get but when you get like two. or three years down the line. and you see people posting on social media. saying like writing open. letters to the person. who passed away is if they're going. to read it yeah still using this. outlet like it for me. sometimes it feels like they're using the person's death. as a way to. draw attention to. themselves yeah which i feel is kind of shitty yeah but obviously you know i've had people in my family die. i've never felt the need to. write letters out in public. because i feel like why it. makes no sense you know. but uh if i'm being an [ __ ] please feel free to. tell me and uh yeah would love to. get you guys opinion i. mean thank you very much. love you guys so much thank you. great day people need to. grieve in different ways i get it. if you want to. post a tribute when it. happens but any after that maybe a year after but like when you're writing all. the time it's like dude. hey get over it publicly. at least i mean i don't know if it's a family. thing i get it ongoing. but dude if it's like for chris cornell right. which happens all the time david bowie. [ __ ] like that is just like what are you doing. you're just expressing your fandom. you don't like can't possibly. like grieve their death three four. five years on if it's your [ __ ] beloved uncle or parent or child i [ __ ] get it it's still like too much but like you said people grieve in different ways yeah yeah so i don't ever have a problem with like missing you dad like five years on whatever it is that's fine but that yeah the celebrity thing is not but also like a little thing i don't know though man like i i you know when i see stuff for somebody's like people who die. tragically or pull you know. or like too young. then i kind of get it. you know if they were so it's like oh you would have been this. age today you know. yeah but like if you're like you're people. do like your grandma like she was. like [ __ ] 98 it's like dude you lucked out. yeah that's a good yeah. she lucked out you lucked. out what are you like you know. yeah people are [ __ ] getting shot right. now yeah well but it's all relative they're not gonna like oh there's some random. person that gets shot you know no. i know i know i know i get it. bro it is sometimes frustrating. but you can kind of delineate. the difference between somebody who. actually gives a [ __ ] and then just some like thought that's like oh my god. i love heath ledger. yeah that's like you like the joker you. [ __ ] idiot yeah uh that was funny when you said they're all relatives. yeah i know but it went. on it that's why. i wanted to call. it out thank you you. know all right uh yeah let's do the next. one i guess oh yeah what's up. matt and chris so chris just saw you in dc. shows rad uh we did a meet and greet afterwards. the picture was sick for the review of the picture. afterwards i realized you had a sharpie in your hand. and i was just like messed it. up opportunity miss i got. to send my jordan ones or something but i was too. concerned with chopping it up. with you and having a moment. which i remember this guy so leads me to. my question how do you prefer meet and greets. to go and then matt if somebody rolls up on. you in public or spots. you somewhere because the show is that it's so popular. yeah how would you want a fan. to interact with you appreciate you. guys looking forward. to the advice i feel. like i've talked about this you do. it uh when it happens uh i just as long as they don't want to. like carry on some [ __ ] conversation. about a thing i don't really know. about or or even worse. something i've talked about on either. this but podcaster previous. one uh sometimes people have seen the american. animal i want to. talk about that like just uh that like i don't appreciate it. but like nobody not just me. nobody wants to stop and have a long. uh even a short. conversation with a stranger full stop you. know what i mean but obviously say something. you're happy to see someone. you care about like these people. appreciate that but like the only rule. is never ever while. they're eating and that's what i've always thought. even as a kid like i didn't want. to go up to. people that i saw uh celebrities whatever the [ __ ] while they're eating people do it all the time when i'm eating and with my kid it just seemed wrong. yeah yeah uh i i still take pictures. but it's like just if you're gonna be selfish. be selfish like they'll come. up and be like i don't want to. bother you but i you know. i i know you're with your kid. and i i know you hate this. it's like oh so you're just [ __ ] don't like you don't give a [ __ ] about you'd rather than be a pretender oblivious though. i get that i'd rather than be like dude. can i get a pick yeah 100. less words or what well. no because it's like i'm i'm not a fool. right well do you know. what i mean no but like uh yeah i don't know. there's no i'm not happy. to do the meet and greets. i used to. [ __ ] hate doing them and now i like them and dude i think it has to. do with the cbd and i'm not joking. dude i'm not joking. plugging away dude no i'm not even dude. i i don't know what it. is i'm like generally happier. and a more appreciative person. maybe it's all the therapy but i [ __ ] straight up that but it could be the cbd helping i i straight. up i'm like oh cool. i'm engaged in conversations. i like doing meet and greets. i you know i do a hundred each show. which is it takes a long. time but uh it's also good for my yaper. it's good from my pocket. do what i do a hundred me. a hundred people each show. oh my god but it keeps my pockets. you know fat like a beetle. okay okay well i mean that's good. good for you people. obviously love it i just yeah. i like it i like doing it. and i appreciate it. and i remember that guy. he was a nice guy. just be nice just be nice as long. as you're nice just be nice hey bro. we need to get a pick. none of that [ __ ] that drives me to. do anything trust me. yeah yeah i'm not do you're not doing. me a favor bro. yeah be nice and be uh deferential. yes that's the word yeah. all right cool hey matt. and chris um i'm a big. fan i love you guys. depend on you guys thank you. so much um for this. podcast my question you know how men just seem to. get better and sexier as they age. or at least a lot. of them do my husband is. just getting more and more beautiful. hotter and hotter. and um i'm 45. we are 45. he works at a bar and i can see. i don't go there very often but when i do i can see how 20. 30 year old women are women of all ages. how they look at him. and you know they just wish he would take them. home i've seen them like desperately try. to touch him like as they hand. it their credit card like grab his arm. with both hands and lean. into i'm really insecure. to meet anybody as his wife. because i'm just thinking or they wondering. like there's an attractiveness. gap oh come on use a babe. dude and meanwhile i don't know just the way. i grew up and at the time. period i grew up um i feel like it's always been a priority. to look good and be pretty on. top of being a mother. and having a career and all that. and i just feel like i want to. be free of that. at this age i feel. like it could be my time. to relax and not have to. anyway but it's not uh what do i do. um any advice not necessarily what i do. just any advice um okay thanks. of all people like she's truly like really pretty. but that doesn't matter even. he loves you yeah i mean first of all i yeah. the fact that she's 45 is crazy. she looks way younger than 45. you. wanna do tit for tat. i guarantee more guys would sleep. with you than women would sleep. no questions there's no question. there's no question so he works. in an environment that. lends itself to that [ __ ] you don't we just said people are getting. drunk at the bar it's like you know. so i understand a bartender. i don't know if he's a bartender. but it's like a thing that like has like something. that goes along with it. it's yeah you going to. the bar is like literally go uh going. online and searching for hate about yourself. it's just you're gonna you're gonna find. a reason to. get insecure about it. just did that's his [ __ ] if you trust him great. if you're not instagram about that. great um and if you're insecure. about getting uh uh like worse. looking it actually kind of breaks. my heart a little bit that. you say like you worry that. people think that there's an attractiveness. gap that nobody's thinking that nobody's nobody's thinking that. i can tell you right. now i see you and i see your face. and nobody's thinking that nobody saying that. i mean i'm not saying that. doesn't exist people probably do think that about people. but it's not happening i bet. it happens way less than people. who are in relationships. think it happens because everybody's always down. on themselves and up. on their partner because they [ __ ] love them yeah but there's a version of that. that's probably in his head. too but honestly. you don't need to. feel that way because you are a beautiful. woman and uh he loves you. and and beauty is uh beauty is also something that sort of grows. and changes with age. from the point of view. of the partner you know. they might not be like ah you're like you don't look. exactly like you did when you were like [ __ ] 21 or whatever but you're so many other things now to. the partner as well. uh and it's not like you have a problem. in the [ __ ] looks department. so i get where you're coming. from but uh those women would only be if anything just plain jealous. of you that's it they would want. to be in your position. you are at the top. of the pyramid in these women's. yes because you are the one. that gets to go home. with him think of him. the horizontal mom but you think it. is what's he doing married. to her people thinking damn. i wish i was her you're the one. who gets to [ __ ] you know. back it up right into. his midsection you're the one. who gets back it. up yeah you're the one. who gets to go to. wrong city with him you're the one. who gets to do the horizontal. mambo you're the one. who gets to 69 with him. okay you're the one who gets to. go down i'm in the car. you're driving i had a guy. call in or a session. a session with a guy uh who was like and i'm not gonna get too. into it but he was talking about how he has like a crisis of confidence. and i was like looking at the guy. when he we first [ __ ] went on zoom. and i saw his face. i was like oh this. [ __ ] he's so goddamn handsome. and then he's talking about the crisis. i'm like this [ __ ] guy's like a regular hot. guy yeah you know. uh but people when the when it comes to. themselves they're [ __ ] perspective is so warped do you know who you are on the outside you who you are on the inside and you're on the inside and you don't you know what i mean like yeah but also they judge themselves on the outside incorrectly well yeah well that's what i'm saying like you don't necessarily have the brain of somebody stereotypically or that we would think has the brain that somebody who comes with that outside looks like and i said all those words together and they make sense it seems because they don't make sense yes they do if you took a transcript of it you could read. it and it would all [ __ ] you have to. read it two or three. times but i have to. do that when i read [ __ ] done you immediately have to. say he's a genius what i said made sense. i swear the chances. of what you said. having made sense are tiny. so torso i didn't say that. in any of his books. you're saying tolstar did not say i swear. to god what i just wrote made sense. no in in russian or whatever. absolutely not even in the russian. versions absolutely they translate to. english and they didn't have that absolutely. not okay well i'm saying he's the one. that gets to dine on some fried. butterfly and and when you go home. with them right here no your husband. gets to dine on some fried. butterfly what the [ __ ] is that you know what fry butterfly is i know what a butterfly is and i know what frying. something is but what the [ __ ] is fried butterfly. imagine it imagining it what. it looks like an imagine it. pink but then it wouldn't be pink. imagine a fried butterfly and imagine. it pink okay i'm doing. it what is it you. know what it is right. yeah okay yeah i get it. i get it i get it. i get it okay. i got it i got it. i got it i got it. i got it i got it. so you're the lucky one. you're the winner you win. dude yeah this girl's. a winner she won. you know um i want to. see the guy though i mean i bet. he honestly looks in the vicinity of me. sometimes he's nuts yeah yeah he wants to. no he doesn't just rest his shirt. he looks like something cute. when you think you look. best uh now oh what do. you mean handsomeness oh and my age. your whole life when do you think you. look back what was your peak looking i think i get i actually do think i get more handsome. as i get older you like five six. years ago me i agree. every day is every day. five years ago. dude well you look exactly. the same so i know but i also but there's something. about me behind my face. that makes me [ __ ] incredibly attractive. oh i was gonna say the opposite. you look good and then you look deeper. and deeper deeper and then it's just no. no no no no no um no there's something crazy. about me that just activates [ __ ] all sorts. of men and women but i bet. her husband looks something like me. which is crazy to. do it's not true you know. what i mean uh it's nuts. to look like she obviously lives. in denver because of look at her. and the and so we'll find when i go to. denver which is in november. they'll come to my show. and i'll see how hot he is. anyway okay yeah i want to. know send send a pic of the husband or a video. in motion at the bar. something like that a live photo. yeah yeah yeah okay cool all right. let's do it next what is up. chris and matt hey love you. guys love the show yeah. keep it super short and simple. because i know that's how my babies love it. uh my name is nate. and i'm a real estate. agent here in spokane washington and as an agent all of my salary and pay comes. from commission which means that if i don't sell houses. i don't get paid and most of my family. understands this and so they like to. support me but recently. i found out my brother. listed his home on the market with another age. group and he didn't even know this. agent and also decided not to. tell me and so i had to. find out because one of my clients. sent it to me. to go tour it and i had to. be like oh that's my brother's house. but i didn't know that. was on the market so what would you do in this situation what would you do if your family didn't support. you in your career i also. haven't really confronted them. about it so should i confront him. or just let it go. thanks 100 gajillion bajillion. percent confront him and 100 percent. [ __ ] let them know that that is [ __ ] john malkovich unacceptable behavior what the [ __ ] is that first i mean at least let's assume they're very close but let's assume it's me and you then that's [ __ ] up if if that happened between us i would abs and you were the one that did it i would be like yo dude what that would be doing insane if i did that with you but i would just be like what are you hard on my sleeve just like what why would you do that and i would go like this eating m m's dude don't hate the [ __ ] game i'm just trying to. stack gaper i mean then i would absolutely kill. you dude hey dude i know we're blood but when you're trying. to stack a person that ain't. got nothing to. do with it jerking a guy. off uh uh no i mean you absolutely. i get the heartbreak baby. but yeah not only reserved the right. to uh uh do that you should. do that for your own. peace of mind dude. that [ __ ] would make me not even be able. to sleep at night yeah. go up to him. be like don't call him. don't text him see him. and be like what were you. thinking what are you. doing what are you doing you're my brother. why would you do that. yes i mean yeah yes uh but okay. what about you [ __ ] no hi yes i know this blazer's too blue but why did you try to. you know what i mean. yeah start with that start with something. that is going to. really hook them in right. unite the two of you in the same. boat we both agreed. this place there's two blue. i should get a different. one maybe more muted. so anyway why did you yes but what would fill in the don't. just why did you list a house. and it's not is it. because of my blazer's too blue. do you know what i mean. right this isn't a color. that should be a blazer. right it should be cancer. are you saying lead him. into the wrong answer so it. gives you the right there. we go right right. okay yeah okay yes and then this. blazer is the the color. of something that would be hanging on a christmas. tree or something like that. anyway why did you list your house. not with me for for for instance. we both agree that this. place there's two blue now do we also agree. that it's shitty that you did. this with the listing yeah. it's 100 yeah because they're both. just they're both equally as obvious. let's list ridiculous things the color. of this blazer you listed a house and didn't use me as your real. estate agent do you have any yeah exactly. yeah yeah so here here are the list. of very obvious things that we absolutely. agree on right one this blazer is way. way too blue yes. two yeah you listing a house. with a realtor who is not me. yes very very just three the holocaust. boy hitler did is very bad yes and four ballparks. if my character was a character. movie i would be the aid to. a politician so yeah. let's yes yeah or just in real. life i look like an aide to. a politician yes 100 maybe you thought yes to. give you the benefit of the doubt. maybe you didn't remember right. i'm a real estate agent. you looked at me and thought. that is an aid yeah to. a democratic policy oregon yep. you know what i mean. a woman and so yeah oh yeah yeah um democrats without. question right right yeah so uh yeah man you got to. bring it up it. is weird if you are close. with them it's especially weird. but yeah you just be like yo. why did you do you not. think i'm good at it. because you might say something. like off which is still wrong. but you might be like oh [ __ ] i thought because we were family. i shouldn't have done it. and then at least you could be like oh and he's like i'm so sorry. it might be that but you can also fix. it so so definitely bring it. up just be like oh if it's that. he just be like well of course either. way you should have asked me. though it's super weird why wouldn't you at least. come to me. if you thought it was illegal. or something then like just come to. me about it like it. would be super weird like if you were having a a roast of yourself. and [ __ ] mark norman was i'm seeing it you know i'd be like what the [ __ ] i do like mark norman though i mean yeah he's funny but like you know i'm your brother that's a good idea i might do a roast to. myself but norman host it sounds like a good idea. no no i show up with a blue. blazer all right uh yeah i think that that's bad. dude that dude that's that is top. level shitty that your brother. did that dude you know. i just get confused. um it's you you did it. what the [ __ ] uh yeah dude i mean you are 100 right. all right gotta gotta gotta gotta gotta got it. gotta gotta gotta dude. gotta gotta gotta gotta bring it. up oh god i gotta got it. gotta gotta got it all right. got it gotta bring it. up okay don't do that. i don't want you to. be doing that um isn't that crazy. so
