[ __ ] movies ridiculous it's [ __ ] ridiculous it's [ __ ] [ __ ] dude like don't make it ocean's 8 it's sexist make it ocean's eleven make it a [ __ ] new thing you can't make it ocean's 8 and say here we go women it's less women and so people are i love how some people are gonna be like well you only need less women to. do the job all right. you know what that's [ __ ] so many women that aren't getting. paid that all these men. got paid to. do oceans [ __ ] eleven jennifer lawrence she didn't do it get her in it give her [ __ ] thirty million dollars and do it or get jennifer lawrence don't get aquafina and [ __ ] rihanna oh man so funny to. me it's so funny. to me that they made oceans. eight dude i wish they made oceans. forty forty women and it got down to. like women you saw in some movies. one few times like there. was one woman from a soap opera. and an another woman were you're like i think i just seen. that girl at my grocery store. and she was just like let's do this. in the produce section the fact. that they remade ocean's eleven. anyway is ridiculous but here's the deal. when hollywood remakes like apparently. ocean's eleven the original. version which was with frank. sinatra dean martin sammy davis jr. peter. lawford joey bishop angie dickinson i mean. everybody would these pictures of black. and white you know it. was the worst movie ever. and so at least remake. the worst movie ever that's what movies. should be remade is are the worst. movie ever don't remake good movies. because they're already good like when steven soderbergh. was like i'll make oceans live dude. they would never make that. movie now because of the climate. they'd never make that move. if none of the oceans movies. made they'd never make that movie because it's two male heavy. anyway iii was talking about that i trailed off. and then my producer one fire. [ __ ] started pointing at something on the table and it completely confuse me so i got the room so one fire i'm gonna get a new producer but um he was like pointing and i was like you need to. tell me something he was like man. and he was like i never mind. so anyways a [ __ ] and one fire but um yeah it's a christmas. episode dude oh [ __ ] for [ __ ] sake [ __ ] it's probably good i don't know i'm [ __ ] cate blanchett is amazing in senator bullock it's [ __ ] one of the best movie stars of all time so it's probably [ __ ] good thunder boys. [ __ ] hilarious actually she's how long has she been acting 50 years and she still looks good i want to. be a [ __ ] i want to. be her i want to. be a chick like that that's just [ __ ] badass for. 40 years i mean she was in oldies [ __ ] movies member that love potion number nine. love potion notions nine um okay yeah but it's christmas. coming up and or no. now i'm sorry to. all day coming up

[ __ ] that i can sing like that i don't give a [ __ ] that's good yeah it's good i do ye. t woo it's christmas. we never talk about cheer except for christmas. time um favourite christmas film. i don't know you know. i would say what is. a christmas from a christmas. ohm is a film that takes. place during christmas and makes you feel christmassy when you watch it. but sometimes i play christmas. films in june unlike hbo. which is [ __ ] weirdest [ __ ] but they'll do it makes no sense. but i would say i owe you. know my favorite christmas. movie is [ __ ] what's the one is it called jingle all the way with almost forcing her and sinbad that one they're good to. get the tip a man. on his horse [ __ ] trying. to get dude sinbad is [ __ ] hilarious he's trying to. get turbo man and sinbad. plays a mailman and he's trying. to get the turbo man. the last turbo man. and they [ __ ] basically it's like a fight to. the death it's so funny. dude that movie i'm gonna watch a movie and [ __ ] laugh and then i was watching in june. i also like diehard and here's the thing. it bugs me. when people ask if it's a christmas. movie because it doesn't matter it doesn't matter. that's the answer that question. on the it became a thing. on the internet like one of those. things that people like to. talk about like how good is pizza is. chris diehard at a [ __ ] christmas. movie here's the answer to. that it doesn't [ __ ] matter it doesn't matter you watch the [ __ ] movie and you can watch a movie in march and then also watch in christmas. and you can actually feel christmassy. so yeah it's of course. was what we were watching. it at christmas if not you're not watching. it christmas it's not a christmas. movie but diehard is one of my favorite action. movies of all time. i mean it might be number one. it might be number one. it's great i love it. it's so good bruce willis. is a great action hero. he's a great action here he's also a good. actor but he's a great action hero. because look i love the rock. more than the just as much. as the next guy and i love i love jason. statham i'm a big fan. of both of those guys i love those guys but there's something about the [ __ ] bruce willis. generation where he was like. that he was like fit but he wasn't buff. i like [ __ ] when action movie stars are not the biggest guys. in the movies because it's more relatable and you and it's like you it's just cooler. to me keanu reeves that in speed. was a great one. it was great casting it was. i love that movie but he was just like a guy. and fit and cool and definitely an alpha. and you believed him. with a gun but he wasn't like this. hulking guy who [ __ ] deadlifts 8,000 pounds. you know and that's what the rock. is and that's fine. and that's what semester stallone. was too an honor. for snyder of course but those guys who like in the 80s. and 90s like like kurt. russell was a great one. to me [ __ ] just not overly buff. yeah chuck norris it was ridiculous. but that one you know i mean. it's different when they know. like martial arts because that's more about that. look at the martial arts. films like they don't really make those anymore. they make them but they're not like big. hits like i mean yes jason kind of like that. but not really but like even like they don't like what's his name. on was that one that. didn't move owen wilson jackie. chan like dad those those movies. don't really exist. anymore do they like jet li. and [ __ ] they don't only make those anymore. that are like they're not big. hits you know yeah best present. i've ever given best present you've ever. received by at beasley kelly. i don't [ __ ] know worst gift. i ever gave was my gave. my dad an audiobook once. because i didn't know what to. give him and it was like some [ __ ] i just really liked the audiobook. so i just picked one out. we just have to. wait at the top of the stairs. to uh i used to. have i used to. have to wait at the top. of stairs with my brother. get ready cause he was smaller. and [ __ ] and you'd be like wait for your brother. we're walking down and see the gifts. under the tree let's stand. abroad at the same time. and then matt used to. have a head start and there's one video that we have from like vhs and were like matt's walking. through the doorway and i walk past. him and i bump him. and he hits his head. on the side of the door. and [ __ ] it's so funny because he doesn't stop smiling cuz he's looking at the presence we always [ __ ] that we always [ __ ] talk about that every christmas. when i [ __ ] zipped past matt when i passed matt. and i [ __ ] bumped his head into. the doorway and he literally just went huh. because he was looking at the presents. he was looking at the [ __ ] thundercats layer. that we got or whatever. the [ __ ] mmhmm best gift. i ever got how annoying. is it when when people like best. gift i ever got my family. oh really we're talking about [ __ ] [ __ ] that cost stuff. best gift i ever got i don't. know mmhmm i don't know i always feel like the best. gifts are the gifts that. you don't that you wouldn't get you wouldn't. buy yourself and you don't necessarily need it but somebody gets it. for you and it's like oh it's cool. i have that now because i would never buy that. but it's [ __ ] it adds to. my life like i don't know what is like that. but like like like a [ __ ] i don't know like a like a like i guess thoughtful gifts. are really good though. like [ __ ] oh like i love [ __ ] shoes if somebody got me like a [ __ ] shoe [ __ ] rack or some [ __ ] you know that'd be a good gift for me like i mean i already have all that [ __ ] but i'm just saying like i don't know it's hard to. get gifts man or when people say what do you get the guy. who has everything you know you have to.
