[ __ ] lay it out in the most basic of terms okay. my buddy dan says for no. reason you know what's supposed. to rain tomorrow and i go and i say oh cool and then he says yup. and then we just keep drinking. coffee because that's all. i do is drink coffee. all [ __ ] day long and when people say well maybe that's why you have restless leg syndrome i get [ __ ] pissed off because that's not gonna stop and also that's not why because i've done [ __ ] you know testing for it i've had a control and a [ __ ] whatever the other thing i'm the science but i do testing for my restless leg syndrome you know what helps restless leg syndrome for real bustin or not sensation anyway my buddy do it and here's why man because he [ __ ] goes like this it's gonna rain tomorrow and i said yeah he said yup and then we just kept drinking that coffee alright and then he goes and then and that's it and that's [ __ ] it later on in the night we were walking down sunset going to. get something to [ __ ] eat or something i don't remember maybe we were getting another coffee. because i'll get two coffees. in a [ __ ] row dude. i'll go to one cafe. get a coffee drink half. of it bring it to. the next spot and then drink another [ __ ] coffee anyway i don't remember what coffee. shall be right but we were walking to. another one probably okay and i zip up. my [ __ ] jacket and i say kind of [ __ ] i got [ __ ] cold out didn't it and he said i told you was gonna get cold and i go like this i lean back like a teacher proud of his student but you know there's something else going on like maybe they [ __ ] cheated that's how i look at him and i say oh yeah and he says yeah i said it and i said well when just say that and he said i said it was gonna rain tomorrow we broke the microphone on that one man that was a [ __ ] mic break. that we're didn't even come from. dude over here dan. made me break my microphone. dude dude [ __ ] legit okay now this [ __ ] drives me bananas dude i'm [ __ ] ba na na ass right now and he goes and i said oh well that's different dude well that's different and he said and he was trying to. act like because he said it. was gonna rain the next day. that it was gonna get cold. tonight and he said he said it. dude and he said he said it. and i got so mad at him. and i said we're done. dude we're done you've moved from my [ __ ] like seventh best friend. down to my [ __ ] like 36th best friend. and that's enemy territory because i don't even have really 36. friends i've got like 25. friends and then you know it's like that venn. diagram where it's like oh yeah but you're also my enemy. in a way he's in the middle. there so then i posted up. a [ __ ] instagram video and i explained this and then he come he comments this [ __ ] this is what he comments hey people guess what this is what he says first of all i says hey people like his [ __ ] kevin hart guess what it's [ __ ] rain last night and it dropped 32 group and it dropped 20 degrees like i said it would the first time chris lee doesn't remember this because he's perpetually distracted therefore has the memory of a flea and here goes accusing me of lying i will be okay yeah so he's gonna sue me ha jokes and [ __ ] people feel some dents i get it it's actually funny they says all this and then and then he [ __ ] right here it's some guy says rain can come with a cold front mr. d'elia usually i like a rants but this one was dumb and i wrote way to. make it serious buddy. also that's not he didn't say. it was gonna rain. so that's what's up anyway. then dan writes yeah see whoever this. dan guys remember saying it's gonna rain. and the temper is gonna drop 20. degrees like you're saying too but the chris. d'elia guy doesn't remember the temperature. part because he usually was. only half listening and they gets mad. at people later on for making [ __ ] up. okay dude well fine well then why. then later on that. night dude why later. on that night didn't you. bring that up dude why didn't you bring that. up later on that. night was i not listening. then because then i was in full throttle full throttle heated mode i listen. when i'm in full throttle heated mode so now who's making [ __ ] up. a day later and i know some of you. see here's the deal. this is exactly what the congratulations. podcast is about it's about san chu maine all right. and it's about [ __ ] learning these types of things. now this is what npr should be talking. about why these kinds of things. happen but instead they're literally talking about. like the economy global issues. okay this is the important. [ __ ] this is congratulations podcast to. a tea now i don't remember what i was. gonna say in the beginning. of that sentence and it. doesn't matter that's also what congratulations. podcasters to the tea. but i'm [ __ ] pissed dude and now he's my thirtysix friend and it crosses over into. enemy territory yeah dude it's just it's just i don't know why that [ __ ] is always driving me and driven me nuts those kinds of things that's not what you said but that's not what you said i can't believe how many times i've said but that's not what you said in my life dude i've said but that's not what you said more times than vince vaughn has said it mmm no doubt so that's it we got too many liquids on here we got a [ __ ] ice americano. we got a 40. ounce of water that shout out to. my boy theo rossi with the company. and then we got to. look froy and then we got a [ __ ] anyway i said we have a nicer americano. but that's too many drinks. my buddy i ripped my irish buddy. at drink has so many drinks. on him all the time. he always has a [ __ ] coffee water. and an actual drink like a [ __ ] like a drink drink. with alcohol in it bro figure it out it. got two hands he'll you goro. that's a [ __ ] slam and that's a [ __ ] slam who you goro um anyway man my pitcher sweating so hard it's crazy it's like they film [ __ ] jumanji under my armpits i cannot believe he did that dude that was the first [ __ ] by the way that was the first microphone swing away [ __ ] come back boomerang that i've ever done and he deserved it dude anyway don't get the curve right here's the deal my buddies all so scared about the corner virus he's like i always think stuff is like not gonna hit us and [ __ ] like that but the corona virus is very very what do you call what's the contagious. and then and then i was like oh yeah and he said cuz somebody got it in like northern california. and they weren't even they didn't. even go anywhere on an airplane. si okay so it's very catchable that my babies. so anyway we're those masks. i can't wait to. go to west palm. beach next week next month. and wear the [ __ ] mask for real. and be like one of those asians. the asians been

the fact that the it loops. around the ear it just makes me. feel like we're dumb humans. you know like the fact that they were like that. some like literally anybody was like. have ears and they just effect. i've always thought this that they scoop. around the ears is just so dumb. you know like they're like we'll just put it behind the ears. classic anyways like 3,000 people died. from the corona

together now doughnut sandwich new fried chicken dish don't call it a dish dude you know it's a [ __ ] cancer sandwich the new dish from kfc bro kentucky for chicken a doughnut served hot imagine eating imagine how much for real you gotta [ __ ] yourself imagine eating that sandwich and then also drinking a coffee and then just having it wow you're you would take a [ __ ] and your [ __ ] would sound like colin firth in king's speech it would just come out like do your [ __ ] would just be people from the other room outside of the bathroom would be like is he watching king's speech [laughter] oh i realized something too man i was watching the macmillan's documentary dude you're not a dork if you just laugh so much yes i figured it out dude all you got to. do is laugh at everything. always and you're not a dork. you're not corny you're not anything but [ __ ] awesome i realized it the guy in the macmillan's documentary. is an fbi agent. and he is his name's like doug. something and he's so dorky. but he just laughs at everything. and it makes him so not dorky. because he doesn't give a [ __ ] look they're calling him. a breakout star what millions breakups. our fbi agent doug matthews thinks of the mcdonald's. fraud doc doug matthews dude. is [ __ ] he's an fbi dude. he's a special agent. and he's like yeah they were doing this. one gig where you know. we're trying to find this. one thing out and i didn't care. i don't always boring and so i saw this. one thing and he just goes and then you're like oh my god dude. wait go go back up. yeah dude bro doug matthews is the [ __ ] [ __ ] when he laughs he looks so british. running laughs oh ho ho ho. he looks like he's gonna be like that. dude this guy as soon. as he gets she's good to. [ __ ] in weekend this is it describes i don't know this is on a houston website or some [ __ ] described as lightning in a bottle hernandez and i never wild character. they love him into. work ever as soon as he got on the phone. it was like when can i come to. jacksonville and see you guys hernandez. dude he wasn't in he wasn't an undercover. agent he was a regular fbi. agent he was always trying. to go undercover for like. he was always trying to. go undercover for like things. that you didn't need to. go undercover for they be like hey can you grab me. a straw for my [ __ ] thing and be like sure let me get the glasses. and you're like no just we're at [ __ ] starbucks. and you just draw for my marcano and they'd be like oh anyway. yeah let me get my moustache and glasses. i gotta go get some [ __ ] sugar for your coffee. no just do it it's fine. if you're doug mathews so finally this if you haven't. seen millions which is really [ __ ] a crazy documentary. i don't know i don't think all. of the episodes aired yet. but i've only seen like two or three. and they show it's about the mcdonald's. when they did monopoly there. was like fraud and people were like selling tickets. and the fbi tried to. find out who they who these people. were and they took the next winner and they went. undercover as a documentary team. from mcdonald's that was like film. in his experience and this guy goes like this. doug what is it matthew's he says well i'm gonna go. undercover and and i want to. do the documentary crew and i want to. be the director and the reason why i want to. be the director is because directors he says it's cuz everybody knows directors don't do. [ __ ] he's an fbi agent. directors do hey doug matthews directors do the whole. thing you know so i loved him. immediately dude oh god he's funny. and anyway so he is he would be a dork. if he wasn't laughing but because he's laughing and doesn't give a [ __ ] about this. [ __ ] he truly is just the [ __ ] so i figured it out man i figured it out so that's what i'm gonna do from now. on when anybody makes fun. of anything what i wear what i wear they're like oh you're too too. old which is ridiculous dude. i mean bro i'm old are you. kidding me i can practically. can't roll over yet. that's how young i am. i'm so young my poop is yellow. bro i'm so um actually it's not even yellow. it looks at the [ __ ] la brea tar. pits man because that's what comes out when you [ __ ] first ivory like for the first few days because you still were eating the stuff from your mommy's placenta sensation did you know that when babies come out and i know that because you know you know why i know that now because well my life's a little different than it was last week was isn't it and it's because [ __ ] babies [ __ ] out their mommy's placenta stuff and that's the scientific term of it uh and when they do it looks like the la brea tar pits for a few days and then the poop comes out yellow yellow dude the yellow it looks yellow like some [ __ ] that like [ __ ] somebody would slip and fall in and then a week later become a marvel superhero that's how it looks it's baby [ __ ] man oh no here's baby [ __ ] man what happened to. him he slipped and fell. in some baby [ __ ] you know it's bright. yellow oh yeah and then that would be [ __ ] in real life and then i would try to. do it and i would just get pinkeye so anyway. adds better help mmhmm is there. something interfering with your happiness. or preventing you from achieving. your goals now i've fallen

cleared. it cuz what happens. is here is a little bts. on the [ __ ] behindthescenes of congratulations. podcast never mind it's not important. but what is important now. i [ __ ] just remember bts. is that a [ __ ] asian group alright dude hey are they video games. i've got a question for you. bts are you video games. the only reason why i asked that is because you look like people on final fantasy you don't look like actual people you look like when you move it goes oh. god that's all did you see. oh my i don't and i know their fan. base is voracious and they [ __ ] with you and they're so angry. at you if you make fun. of them and i just want you. to know plain and simple. and very clearly i don't give a [ __ ] you understand. me do you feel me. saying that first of all. bts well the first of all is they look. like video games period. they look like actual video game. characters they would be like where they would be like hello. would you like to. talk to me and you're just like what. would you like to. talk to me about the village. i'm sure where can i find the disk. well all i know is jeremy's been talking. about it for a long. time you might want to. check with him how many times has ever. one in the group btw. i said this you might want to. check with him he was acting kind of strange. i'm not sure but jeremy was acting kind of strange. you might want to. talk to the stork through. now how many times i'm [ __ ] bts. how many members of bts. are there how many human members. in south park where the guy. goes human that's also funny. but goddamn their video games. dude i how were there. they already have a plastic. surgery right aren't they like 12. or are they like have they been around. for a long time oh this. video episode on wow. they could dance though. huh but that's because they're animated. dude there's this one video that this. guy keeps i think it's brendon. walsh um let me see yeah. i think it's him it's so funny. he's my favorite got to. follow on twitter malibu. oh it's brendon walsh malibu. brendon and he keeps tweeting. the bts he calls the bts. salami biting fake out and first of all was on fallon. tonight i guess we're one. of the guys but he looks like a video. game dude we're ago. he pretends to. bite a huge piece of salami. and then doesn't and like gives the camera. wide eyes like he faked him. out and malibu brendon brendon water which is brendon. walsh's comedian he's hilarious and then you're right. forget about the coronavirus watching. bts boy prank by. the salami is infectious have a salami. i have salami fever. and he's done like 40. of these knock knock who's there. i'm gonna bite the salami. i'm gonna bite this salami. who jake hey i'm not gonna bite the salami. lol i thought you were gonna bite it i know i tricked you. ha bts salami biting fake out you got to. look at these they're really funny. but the one that made me laugh. so hard is probably the first one. he does not bite that. salami in this video but if any salami 's. get bitten in the future. he will be the prime suspect. right and that's number 25. and he writes onefourth of the way. to one hundred tweets about. this bts salami biting fake out. jim dude i think he's the funniest. guy on twitter it might it might be rob delaney. i mean that guy's been killer. for a long time but [ __ ] [ __ ] man like the fact that he's going so hard in the paint. from this [ __ ] thing the guy from bts. i hope he's seen he's probably. i'll [ __ ] i mean he looks like a video game look at here here's another one. if you watch closely. it looks like he's definitely about to. bite that salami but at the last minute. he stops and moves a salami. away from his face the question. is was his plan. in advance there was a done. spot oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] the one that i laughed so hard at was the one i think i retweeted it how do i get to. my own twitter said said dad. i wrote i wrote this. is the funniest got into. it i've read in five years. oh this one was my favorite. one for sure then number seven the director is like the director is like salami. biting scene take one action wait cut cut cut don't bite that. salami and the doom and the dude. is like as you [ __ ] as you wish really put me over the top man. what i don't the legit. i when i first saw this. is how i learned who bts. was by the way i thought eyelid [ __ ] that

you think maybe you were talking. to someone else did you for a second. think i was the fisher king so he said yeah you know and i just gonna go out. there sometimes just to. unplug let me ask you a question man this is the thing and it's been around for a long time ever since we've like invented a microwave. why do people need to. [ __ ] unplug i truly think if you're someone who values unplugging you're like a drama queen drama king not levelheaded insane person he said it he said [applause] why do you need to. unplug dude what's up dude. what's going on with that. you plugged in is that. what it is you plugged. in too much when people are like god you know what i'm so glad. i left my phone at home. it felt great just walking. around unplugging it felt great just being out. camping in the middle of nowhere. next to a creek i just had to. unplug even for a few days and now i feel recharged dude you know what recharge is you a salad. a burger you don't have to. [ __ ] sleep on twigs to. unplug that's a [ __ ] new i guess western [ __ ] philosophy thing where it's like we have it so goddamn good that you just can't have it good you're your [ __ ] guilt you we have it so good we invented walls we invented microwaves there's a toaster out there dude you could put your bread that we manufactured by the way in a toaster and turn it into. hot bread that's better and because we've got it. that good you think you gotta unplug. and be away from the toaster. so you can recharge and be a stressfree better. person well let me tell you something. guy who does that you're just terrible. at base at base you're terrible. you don't need to. unplug you can go on vacation fine. experience another thing cool go. to hawaii go to. [ __ ] bali lay in a hot. butt sleep in a bedroom man. you know why cuz we made bedrooms. and it took us so many [ __ ] centuries and and and thousands and thousands million what do you called millennium millet millenias millenniums whatever the [ __ ] that goddamn word is that part millennia you know we [ __ ] spend thousand thousands of years coming up with these impossible thread thread counts man and you're gonna go lay on a [ __ ] rock you just don't get how to. be man i get art. millenia that's what it is. and i get how our eyes. are adjusting because now we're looking at [ __ ] closed screens. all the time and our eye. sights are worse than it. was but dude adapt like the [ __ ] tadpole man you're not a tadpole you're a frog. and that's a beautiful thing. you think the frog. is ever like a man. i hate these legs no. they're just jumping from lily. pad to lily pad going. ribbit enjoying their frog. sense enjoy your human [ __ ]. man [ __ ] unplugging i don't trust anybody one plugs plug in i'm plugged in all the time. dude you know where my phone. is ever here you know. wherever my phone is you know. what i've never lost my phone. i lost my phone. one time it was in like 2008. and i'll never lose. it again because i've been plugged. in since then i [ __ ] left a diner. at the goddamn standard hotel downtown and i left. and i walked back. and it wasn't there. and that was one of my favorite. phones it was one of those ones that [ __ ] slides out like that and it looked like you were in the matrix but whatever man i've been plugged in ever since and some [ __ ] jackass was talking to. me for some reason. so long no man. i was in no. way it wasn't 2008. that was like iphone [ __ ] it was like 2002. anyway it doesn't matter when did the cell. phone start you have is a 2003 in august. 2000 nineteen in august. 1999 everybody got a cell phone i left i went to. vancouver to shoot a movie. came back everyone had a cell. phone and everyone was playing snake. um yeah dude i you can't. trust these people who say they unplug. you just can't you can't trust them. with like secrets bro. you're gonna go unplug and change that's the thing. man you've become who you are and anytime you shift. that like one time. i was going out with this. chick and she's like hey i bought a chick. i bought a an airplane ticket. to paris i'm just gonna go for two. weeks and i was like what when she's like in a month. i was like you didn't [ __ ] like tell me before. she's like i just knew if i didn't buy. it i was i wasn't gonna go and i was like we've been together. for like two years you. just gotta buy a ticket. to paris and just go sure. enough she went there she came back she broke. up with me holy [ __ ] [ __ ] dude we love we love predictable people man. we love predictable people and i knew it. was gonna happen and it happened. if you let your girlfriend go. somewhere for two weeks. out of country you might as well break. up with her for real same. goes for
