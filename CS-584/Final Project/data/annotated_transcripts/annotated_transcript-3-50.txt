[music] hello [music] hey dude how do you feel how do i feel yeah i think the question is how do you feel no the thing is how do you feel about now. all eyes are on you. dude because they can't see my face. bro on the [ __ ] like this i feel mysterious and like at an arm's length. which is very cool i may. sound a little different to. the people who just listen. to this podcast it's because why i don't know his job. it's not really a nose. job well it's all good. you know what though it's uh you know. what it is and my nose is. gonna look very nice once. i remove this bandaid it's gonna. look exactly the same. well you never know i mean. i guess have you seen. it without that on there. yet yeah so how does it. look did they [ __ ] it up no. it's swollen a little bit. but it looks the same. okay so that means you didn't get a nose. job well you know i had a deviated. septum and i went to. the doctor and he said he would fix it. it was 95 blocked on the right. side you and i have talked about this. yeah we've talked about this. because you have it too the last episode. i think or two episodes. ago uh and i got it. and uh and it was three. days ago and here i am. back at work now let me tell you something. dude uh you know how raw i am. right like i don't we this. is how we do it. here because we were gonna a lot. of people would just skip. it right and i want to. give you the episode and so i came and i gave you the episode. anyway even though my i got a fullon nose. job you say nose. job people i think you got an actual cosmetic. rhinoplasty yeah i guess that's the term. yeah i i i told him. right before i went to. pass out i was like yo. dude make me look cute. i want a bigger nose. i want a [ __ ] huge nose like liam neeson dude. did you go to. the same doctor that i went to. when i had my sinus surgery. yeah why didn't you ever. tell me that that's so weird. because you asked me. about him do you know. why no because i thought mom [ __ ] probably told you oh well no she didn't well. i want the doctor to. siri dude yeah and he killed it. i'll show you here look. boom there we go. i don't need it joke's. on you oh yeah you don't you. look exactly oh yeah. i'm swollen oh yeah you are small. i'm smaller looks a little piggy it. looks like you got a nose job. well because beautiful you're like shiny around. it because you can't do anything. around yeah i can't do anything. around it yeah so i don't need that. thing but the doctor told me. to put it on but i don't need. it but you still sound all [ __ ] up yeah why because uh there's stint in my nose oh dude when i so i've had stents i've had dents i've had two different pants. i've had i've had two different nose. surgeries in my life one. well that's too many. one when i was a a kid. and i uh ran into. someone and their forehead smashed it in my nose. and my nose was crooked. and they i needed to. get it straightened out. otherwise everything would have been all [ __ ] up in the world and growing. yeah well it turned out. everything still got [ __ ] yeah but don't do that hurts don't touch it. and hurts uh what they didn't. tell me they put like cotton way. up in my [ __ ] brain. oh yeah they don't i don't. and one day you say this. one day i was just hanging out. watching a movie with mom. and i started feeling something. in my nose and i went to. the bathroom and pulled it. out and it was i i was so freaked the [ __ ] well that's gotta be so scary. as a kid too covered. in blood yeah i was like 12. i think it's like a horror. movie yeah kills it was [ __ ] up. and um the next one. was when doctors and cereal. fixed my [ __ ] sinuses because i was oh she had two she would put dude let me tell you what happened before and but now i need the one the [ __ ] you got so i'm gonna have three oh that sucks and i still got this bigass nose i should have haven't fixed it getting whittled down dude yeah make it cute. yeah bro you know. how cute you would be with a nice. nose that's the crux of how cute you can be with your face. i think i look good with a big. nose though as a kid. i hated it yeah i. think now as a man. i think i need the big. nose i like big noses. i like big noses on chicks. too you hitting on me. no okay i like chicks. with nice strong pronounced noses okay. as long as there's no bum. in it dude but no what bump in it. bump yeah bump i can't say the p reverberates in my [ __ ] nose hurts okay yes dude just hurt. twice all for the sake of telling you yes. dude the [ __ ] the p the vibration yup oh yeah lost your [ __ ] mind yeah the m is way more the m is way worse and i keep doing it yes dude dude here's the deal all right. look it'd be a little bit big. lost your mind here's okay. a vietnam vet listen. so here's the deal my nose. hurts i [ __ ] unbelievable man it's all good. we're here we're raw. right we're rock cause we're gonna do. the show anyway it's all gonna sound a little bit nasally all. good right keeping it real. what okay so gotta wear loose. shirts so when i take them. off it doesn't rub up. against my nose and cause the deviated. septum to get all [ __ ]. up what happens when something. like you accidentally hit your nose. i go like this and i get so mad. but do you think like drastic. [ __ ] like you need to. gotta go back in and do it. yeah right yeah why do you why. are you like that that pisses me. off that you'll like that uh i was wearing my sunglasses. like this it's on my head. they go bonk fell on the nose. hurt almost drove right. directly to the hospital. but why are you like that. that's the better question uh i want. everything to be okay and most of the time. it's not gonna be okay. and it's all good i need to. realize that everything's out of my control. talk about my therapist it's all good. yeah everything's definitely understood but so hold on a second. now uh i want to. tell you about when i went and before. we get into the episode. i went into the to. get the surgery um and the [ __ ] doctor is like you ready. and i was like he jokes. you know he doesn't he does. so many jokings hey stop joking. a little bit he does. so many jokings yeah so he is like you ready. and i was like sure they already had the iv. in i don't want to. do this right of course who the [ __ ] wants to. do surgery yeah and he's like all. right here we go but i'm in the i'm in this. [ __ ] i'm in this [ __ ] i'm not in the gurney. yet i'm in this [ __ ] right. so i'm chilling i'm in the lazy. boy chair whatever the [ __ ] they call. it you know the chair. that goes back and he goes like this. he takes a long metal. uh what do you call. it instrument puts it up. my nose i don't know. what he's doing i feel like he's just checking or clearing. it or whatever should have known. because i already know what he. did but well i don't know. what he did he didn't say. i know what he did. but you did it i i didn't do. that you did surgery. no not not not that okay. i already know what you're going. to say was not a shot okay. i understand yeah he put a long [ __ ] thing up my nose went so far up. and then just goes and i go whoa. and he goes all right. next one and i go whoa. and i say what was that. no answer all of a sudden. feels like 120 ants were released. into my brain. okay i don't understand what's happening. i don't understand what's happening. okay my heart starts beating i i i go. oh my god right ants spreading white. plants plant plant plant plant plant. put an ant on that. on hat marching ants all over. my [ __ ] brain that's what it felt like bro. i'm describing it again like a novel does. okay so that's what it. felt like ants just [ __ ] making its way. around my right so then uh but you know he didn't put ants in your head. right so but i don't know what he did. so i'm like what what what is. the deal why does this. why does this feel like [ __ ] ants marching around. in my brain all right. so i say what did. you do and he says i i i numbed you. up there and i go oh i didn't know. you're gonna do that yet. and he says oh yeah we do it. beforehand and i said oh so i'm chilling. right but i'm already a little bit activated. my heart's pumping and i'm like oh my god oh my god so i say is this. normal and he says yeah and i said it. feels like you got my brain. did you get my brain. wow that's such a dumb. [ __ ] ass question kind of joking. though kind of joking right. but you i know you you weren't. joking but here's what i want. i want him to. just be like oh dude. don't even worry but when you ask. a dumb question. like that when you're joking. they're going to joke. back now am i going. to be asking dumber questions. when it feels like 120. ants are marching around in my brain. now the answer to. that is yes right. so he should take that into. account and have some bedside manner and be like dude. i know you're probably worried but don't even. worry about this right. okay but i say did you get my brain. and the jokester you should have known. yeah he goes like this. always yeah he says always i said okay. hey but can you be serious. right yeah and he says no everything's fine. too late because when he said always my blood pressure. dropped to 40. it dropped to. 40 dude but why not because i'm a resting. athlete dude it dropped to. 40 and i go like this. oh my god and i saw absolute pixelization. and i didn't know it. but later on in the day. kristen told me i passed out. i said i did because i was so so nervous. but but you can't pass. out laying down hey do it did it. okay first first ever yeah i passed out. laying down did they pull they've held my feet. up they chris said my body. went like this dude what the [ __ ] dude [ __ ] tell me when you're gonna numb. my brain you know but he didn't you i don't get it. at all dude why would you ask. did you get my brain. yeah you know he didn't get your brand. i know first of all second of all. you could poke through if you asked. it you knew he was gonna joke. back with you because he's a jokester. but i was already [ __ ] up like and really nervous and then so anyway he's like let's do it went into. the gurney after i woke. up went into. the gurney and then he's like lay. down don't remember anything. after that woke up nose. was [ __ ] hurt to. high hell what happened. when you got up so honestly. i this is the truth. i tried to fight the nurses. and doctors physically why do you know. this did i tell you this. i think so i fought i i they the doctor was talking with kristin. in the other room and the nurses say he's waking up. and he says ooh he's awake. he's going to be crazy. i got to go. watch this because he knew i was gonna be crazy. but there's two things you might do when you wake up. from surgery be combative. or be very looseygoosey. he probably thought he's gonna be lucy goosey dude. kristen said it hurt. like there was a they were trying. to tame a willie mammoth in the other room. wow and they were like they were like chris please. they were like dude. bro it was so funny. they're like please chris you just had surgery. please just try to. pin me down but what were you. doing like like trying to. [ __ ] swim get up and roar. yeah wow bro it was [ __ ] funny terrible. patience i know they're like cruising. don't hit your nose. terrible patient wow i mean. i remember when i got you took me i took you yeah. and i got you back. and i and i woke up and i remember thinking i don't even. know why i remember this. but i remember i remember telling you. and the nurses that i had to. go i was in a hurry. because i had to. get to the race. yeah because i thought i was a nascar. driver i said oh really he said yeah. i said are you a nascar. driver you're like uhhuh dude. it's so weird i hate that. [ __ ] it's so disconcerting to. me i don't like watching people. like that i don't even remember trying. to fight the nurses and [ __ ] yeah of course you don't i went back. the next day i apologized. yeah just to. apologize no no no i had an appointment. yeah i had to take. the [ __ ] packing out it was awful dude. it's all awful it's so uncomfortable. but now i guess i'm supposed. to be able to. breathe soon anyway yeah we should get into. the episode i'll talk about this. more on my podcast congratulations. because it's just me uh but before. we even go i got you. some look look what i got you. what does it do what do i open. it up it's a button nope. other way nope otherwise so. now i'm pissed now i'm pissed. and you hit it oh it's different. every time so many different. ones okay so you get these at crystallia. dot com dude no. one i'll ever interrupt you again. i got a free one. there you go all right. so but i didn't interrupt you okay wow that's really funny. actually yeah it's so obnoxious. to have this imagine a boss. and you're just [ __ ] you're talking and they're doing an interview and they say something you don't like you just go like that so dick. dude love it i would love. to you know be awesome. if christian bale brought it in his press. junket for thor love and thunder. all right dude you'll be like so what'd you. think about your character. um all right let's do it. here we go what's up. chris and matt so my wife. was raised to. believe that santa claus and believing. in santa claus is bad. that your parents are lying to. you wow while on the other hand. i was raised allowed. to believe in him. and and just thought it was a fun. and magical part of my childhood. i didn't think of it. as being lied to. um when i was dating my wife. uh her mom asked me. so how do you feel about your parents. lying to you oh my god. oh all of your childhood. oh and that like really hurt. me like yeah because i was just thinking about all the fun memories that i had about their like playing this. santa claus character and uh i had no problem. with it yep um and it continues in that. she doesn't want yeah our son. to have like the santa. claus experience and i'm like is this worth arguing. about in the first place. santa claus let me know what you guys think oh that is what the best. that is the best question. yeah we've gotten so far. and the way he did it. too was really nice. the way he said it. all of it it was just like the way. he said was very concise and good i mean. it wasn't that concise that was a pretty long. video what do you i didn't think it. was that long but mostly one. in the beginning of it. i was thinking about other stuff. okay so you know what he said. uh not really i know. he said the thing about santa. here's the deal i okay. i don't like when people and my therapist agrees with this. because we were talking about what's that. thing where they hook. up all the stuff to. your brain edmr therapy emrd or whatever. the [ __ ] it's called anyway it brings up traumas that you don't necessarily know that you have and it helps you work through them and brings them to. the surface now my therapist says there's two thoughts. of it some of them. people think it's good because it brings all your traumas to. the surface and you get to. work through it but some therapists think it's bad. because sometimes your brain is protecting. you from remembering those. traumas correct and you don't. necessarily need to. work through them because you forget. them and that's okay so here's the thing. this guy's living his life. having a good time loving santa. claus and then all of a sudden this [ __ ] mom is like hey how do you think about your family lying to. you and he's like oh i don't really think of it. that way and she's like well you know. that's what it is technically. and she's basically turning. something that was beautiful. into something like no. you really need to. think about this and she's [ __ ] him up that's not on her that's not him and he should be able. to raise his kid. the way he wants to. raise her but it's her. kid too i know. so here's the deal say. no stay in your ground. why no he's the way. he asked it was right. he's like is this really. something to put my foot down. about [ __ ] santa claus bro the kid is gonna be shunned in school. no he's gonna be the one that everyone's that. is gonna be like ruining it for everybody. i know they're gonna use their [ __ ] no no he's gonna be the popular. one because he knows i don't know it's it's [ __ ] up that what the [ __ ] is wrong with your wife's parents dude that's really weird i mean it is lying but if they're not christian then i get it but like if they're christian and they're just like [ __ ] no we tell no lies what about all the christian [ __ ] well that's lies they believe in it though i know what the [ __ ] he should have spun it back in his face wow what about the [ __ ] about jesus rising from the dead you believe that [ __ ] yeah [ __ ] easter every [ __ ] day you idiot every every year. you idiot right so not the way. to have that conversation no. you should have flung it. back in his wife's mom's face. what i think is it. a christian thing did he say that. no he didn't yeah but i'm saying i'm saying the thing. i'm saying uh which is different. than what he said right. which is honestly you should be saying that. no no because i say he says things. yeah and then i say different. things in response to. it i mean i get it. yeah okay that's what the show. is all right uh i don't think that i think your your wife's mom is super [ __ ] up i think that your wife was sort of kind of deprived. in a weird [ __ ] way of a fun. thing it's just fun like [ __ ] whatever yeah and i but i also think don't [ __ ] fight about who gives a [ __ ] really yeah dude who cares dude i would go nuts if my wife didn't want calvin. to have santa claus who cares. just give him [ __ ] presents. i i mean i guess but it's like what. about the magic of it. and it's so sweet you grow up. and you're like oh yeah okay. i get it everyone. was kind of just it was a thing. for a kid kids it's not. like it [ __ ] someone's making any way you have to. do it now because i got all this. [ __ ] [ __ ] in the back. of my nose but it's like i got ants back. there but um yeah it's like nobody thinks it's insecure. nobody thinks that like they're lies. like this is something. that's wrong with the mother. that's what i'm saying like nobody's lying. to the kids but here's the thing. the what the wife you interrupt me. the wife got [ __ ] up by the mom yeah so it's not the wife's fault. right so just go with what the wife. wants because she's beyond. [ __ ] up because the mom [ __ ] her up it's the mom's fault. yes so let the wife let the wife. [ __ ] have it the way she wants yeah because she's already beyond [ __ ] up yeah and i guess [ __ ] up your kid but with it and everything too and perpetuate the [ __ ] upness i mean the worst [ __ ] therapist [ __ ] up it's like they're gonna fight about it yeah i guess if there's gonna be a fight about it just make sure that you can just get your kids presents and make sure that they can include themselves in the day but i guess it's not worth it if your wife's gonna be [ __ ] crazy and be like hey no no santa claus in our house because it's a lie you know what i mean yeah you're always like wearing makeup that's not really how you look that's a lie too how about do that yeah say that oh you wear [ __ ] pumps you're not that tall what about that you lied. about that like where's the line. yeah where's the line. either don't wear pumps or they're santa. which one something bad. happened to the mom when she was. a kid with santa you know. yeah no [ __ ] man but unfortunately i mean you know what the more. i [ __ ] think about it [ __ ] your wife dude wow that's that's so [ __ ] weird dude you want to. do the thing to. make your kid happy. you should be able to. do it you're not lying. remember when mom told us there. was no santa claus and then dad. was mad because they obviously didn't have that. conversation together and that dad. the next year said you know. so maybe there is santa. claus because we didn't even know you want that you wanted that but we but he still got it. for you santa knew and i was like yeah. i know what you're doing. dude i i don't remember that. how old were we we were doing like a [ __ ] way too old you know and mama was like you know there's not really santa and we're like oh really oh yeah okay and then later on my dad was like yeah oh you know mom said there wasn't no santa i was like yeah and she was like well you didn't tell us that you wanted that right i was like no and he's like did you want that and i was like yeah then he's like well santa knew and that must be santa and i'm like ah all right man we're like we're in a suit yeah we're like 22 you know uh i remember i was like i was like 12. and i i i like cornered. mom and dad yeah like you're gonna [ __ ] tell me wow that there is no santa claus i know there is no santa claus you're gonna tell me and they wouldn't do it they still they would not do it i was like you guys are being so weird i know i [ __ ] know how did you know there is no because i because i was i was [ __ ] basically an adult all right and i understood that there's no guy who brings [ __ ] presents to. every only christian household and goes down. the chimney and is a fat [ __ ] and eats cookies. all night yeah okay. i still do that i believe in him. okay well sorry to. break it to. you but he doesn't exist. do you know where uh yeah. okay well they don't they'd say something. like this by the way i forgot. to tell you dallas. i'm coming up i'll be in there. soon chrisley dot com. dallas get your tickets it's almost sold out. go dallas chrisley dot com. atlanta chrisley dot com these are the ones. coming up wichita chrisleya dot com. uh and a few others. go check it out washington dc. too all right let's go. to the next one. matt and chris what's up uh i love the show. i look forward to. it every week i apologize. on advance for wearing sunglasses i'm just feeling a little ugly. right now and it's all good. there you go uh so i got a blood test uh taken. for the first time uh in my life. you know i'm 33 and the results came back. that i have high cholesterol and i'm a bit. of a hypochondriac so i was really worried. about it you know. i did modify some of my habits and all that. you know i did some googling. um but my you know as far as talking to. my doctor about it he's overweight. and the doctor yes i just wonder like can you take advice. from somebody who very clearly doesn't follow. their own advice you know like obviously i would be asking him. like you know nutrition advice. uh you know health advice. and he seems smart. and he seems knowledgeable but you know. how do you feel uh about people. who are you know. very intelligent and give seem to. give great advice but they very clearly like don't take their own. advice and uh you know. i'm sure you've met people like that. before so uh you know. uh let me know what you think. yeah yeah yeah bye uh yeah. i think for sure he's clearly a professional. that knows way more than anybody. else in your life probably just because he doesn't take the advice. you should so [ __ ] follow it. it doesn't somebody i think this. is a major misconception somebody. can be great at giving advice. yeah just because they themselves. don't take it doesn't mean. that it's less good advice. right two totally separate. things that's what you're saying. like that's why sometimes really good. teachers are failures. and what they did. themselves right like oh you can teach acting but why are you not brad. pitt yeah because that's a totally separate thing. yeah yeah oh yeah you're good. at [ __ ] teaching but why can't you do those who can't do teachers but no that's not right. you you can maybe do it. you actually probably can do it. so you're just teacher. right right you know so you want to. be a teacher and not make the millions of dollars. okay no not everyone gets to. make millions of dollars. well we're good not even that. good so it's not about being good. perhaps it's about looking like. [ __ ] brad pitt brad pitt's backstack. um i i i uh yeah i don't know. i mean doctor fat piece of [ __ ] first of all if you're a doctor don't be a fat piece of [ __ ] you know like be healthy looking right it's like when you see a cop that's fat it's like i don't know i'll run you i'm gonna rob a bank of my outrun you he's getting his gun now yeah but wifi rob a bank right oh wow yeah so you're quick uh yeah dude i don't know man yeah you can take advice from a doctor even though he's fat about health yes you can for sure right yeah because it's not i mean you know maybe he's got maybe he's got food addiction. right that's something oh hey maybe he's got overeaters who the hell knows. right just saying he probably knows. more than yeah he knows more. than you for sure exactly. you're free and easy sure uh so yeah anyway i think that uh yeah listen. to your doctor you have high blood. pressure which sucks cholesterol it. doesn't matter same [ __ ] no one. they were they will they both. lead to heart disease. right i don't think so cholesterol does that's the doctor that's the fat. doctor but uh honestly you'll be fine. just follow your guidelines to. what the doctor's saying and all that [ __ ] and if you have a deviated septum. get a nose job like i did yeah. okay go let's do it. hey matt and chris i'm katie. i just wanted to. ask some advice about my job. i am a landscaper right. now it's my fourth season. doing that and i'm a foreman i have quite. a few people on my crew. who are 19 20. years old whose first season. it is and i know it's a hard. job to get into. and there's quite a. few things that just take some time. and experience to. get the hang of but a lot. of them also just don't generally have a great. work ethic and aren't listening to. me when i tell them what to. do so how do i as their foreman. get them to to. listen to me or should i maybe. just let it go and stop caring so much. um any advice would be awesome. thank you guys it's not. if it's her business i get why. she wants them to. care but if it's not dude. just do your job. as best you can. and you can't control other people. but being a foreman part. of her job is i know work i know but what are you going. to do dude. you're only in control of what you're in. control of right you need you know what it. is you need to. be more charismatic you need to. be a little bit more. like and i don't mean i don't agree. with what he did but hitler. right because hitler was obviously. really charismatic okay. yeah i'm just gonna gloss over. that entirely i'm saying nobody would have followed him [ __ ] yeah they don't do what. you say [ __ ] yell at them. all right that's it no. not no no no nothing hitler. no right uh yell at them. and threaten them that you're going to. get them [ __ ] replaced from the work site. right that's it they don't do the [ __ ] [ __ ] that you tell them to. do then they're [ __ ] shitty. and shouldn't even be there in the first. place right that is a super coveted job. construction's true good job like union [ __ ] and people people really really want those people to. need jobs and tell those [ __ ] if you're not gonna listen to. me yeah i'm gonna [ __ ] get your ass on the street yeah. you could be like you know. you i'd say you're not gonna be familiar but you know. who hitler was and when they'd be like yeah. be like okay well so what he would do. is if you didn't do what he was saying. he would kill you i'm not gonna do. that right because uh it's different. time but that's not really what hitler. was known for doing but okay. this is you just different. time right this isn't the 40s. anymore but uh and also it doesn't matter what your religion is but i will say um i'm not gonna do that. but i'm gonna replace you. and this is a very coveted job. so please uh get to. work and you know join the third. reg or whatever the [ __ ] you want to. say but why would you say that. anything about hitler well you wouldn't but i'm just saying. to like add drama. to it it would get people. really you meant all you gotta do is mention hitler. and people were like whoa. whoa what like right. now i bet is the most engaged time. during this podcast no i don't know most confused. time for sure because it makes absolutely. no [ __ ] sense yeah um but yeah uh [ __ ] threaten them and maybe do like one of these like the thing where you [ __ ] oh wow really you get to. do this oh you don't want. to work no you [ __ ] get up. you just get up in their [ __ ] and go like that i don't know if that would work that's uh yeah i mean you might as well mention hitler. if you're gonna do that no. you you're gonna get fired up. close to him and you just [ __ ] do like the like you're gonna jump like that yeah i know what

boundaries or if i should. just like try to. slow burn it uh i don't think it's very fair. to either of us but maybe it is i don't know i know that. like i would find myself getting really lonely. in a situation like that. um so i don't know trying to. keep it brief uh. you know i think you guys. got the gist let me. know um other than that though. life rips keep doing. what you're doing guys i i

dude she's gonna cheat no no dude. you don't know what real. life's like she's gonna cheat. okay and that's and what you're gonna. do when you come back. you're gonna know she is right. you're gonna know she is because you can see. it in her eyes and she's gonna be like a little different. right you're gonna be like maybe it's because i've been gone. away and they're gonna realize oh okay i see she kind of had a thing with a guy. four doors down i get it. and you're gonna eat that. and it's gonna be fine. and you're gonna move on. to have a wonderful life. so here's the deal stay. with her she's gonna cheat. chill on that eat it. have kids after that yeah i mean. i actually kind of [ __ ] agree with that. there we go dude. i mean there we go. yeah don't break up with her. don't break up with her. why would you break. up with her in fact the fact. that you're even asking makes you think you want. to break up with her. so now i'm thinking maybe not maybe break up. with her break up with her. maybe he just wanted to. be on the show and didn't really have a question. because i don't think she should break. up with her eat it. dude things are really on the up. like you say do you not break. up with her yeah they are on the up. dude look at the guy. he's fine he's cool. he seemed happy and you know. you don't know it's i i don't if if they weren't on the up. he would have told us they're not on the up. what should i do but he said we're not. on the i'm on the up. what the [ __ ] should i do should i break. it off i don't want to. be unfair dude she doesn't even. want that she wants you. to say i'll i love you. enough to wait this [ __ ] out and yeah i might stroke a few guys off. in the [ __ ] navy but whatever when i come back i still want to. be with you and yeah you might [ __ ] donk a guy four doors down but guess what it's gonna be fine. we're gonna wait out that [ __ ] we're both gonna stroke. a few guys and when i come back. we're gonna have some kids. okay way to go. dude it's like i'm not to. get paid for this or well see no. i i don't even think well. yeah well yeah technically you are getting paid. yeah yeah a little bit but yeah hey chris and matt. what's up i'm calling in basically. from next door is downtown la. ultramotive anyways i have some advice to. ask from y'all basically i'm addicted to. sugar and how the [ __ ] do i get rid of that like i feel like i live a pretty healthy. lifestyle other than that like i sleep. well i drink hella water. i'm actually a personal trainer. on the side so the workout stuff. is completely fine it's just a sugar. thing that i feel like i can't. get over like i quit. drinking just overnight i quit. smoking cigarettes just overnight. but the sugar thing i feel like i just can't. get rid of also i don't want to. completely get rid of it. i still want to. be able to. enjoy sugar every now. and then i just don't want to. have it rule my life. which i feel like it kind of does. sometimes so any advice would be greatly. appreciated thanks for everything. you do whoa then she got tattoos on the inside. of her hand did you see. that no that's crazy thirty percent. of your thoughts are about tattoos ah just saying man. what do you think a tattoo i should get the next. one uh dude uh that's crazy. to be that disciplined with uh that's that. is and i think it's because she doesn't want. to totally quit because she can quit. things she wants to. totally quit it's easy you just. and it's gone but she doesn't want to. totally quit sugar so she's. trying to find that balance. and that's what's hard yeah. or she's an addict and that's the reason. why she works out so much. anyway and she works out because that's her addict behavior. and then also she's compartmentalizing. on why she doesn't want to. stop uh eating sugar because she knows. she needs it you know. what i'm saying what does. she need well she she's saying like i don't really want. to stop meaning she thinks she can handle. it but maybe she can't handle it. yeah that's crazy to. be addicted to. sugar i mean i guess a lot. of people are i probably am a little bit. i have streaks where like i'll eat like [ __ ] two pints of ice cream. a day what yeah i feel like for like a week. yeah two pints a day. no like a night like in a condensed. period like all at once like some marlon brando [ __ ] you'll eat two pints at one sitting yeah holy [ __ ] yeah i've eaten one i'm a hard addict though i'll [ __ ] i get on a thing and i just [ __ ] ruin it yeah oh wow yeah uh spanking about yourself so uh all right well so what about um [ __ ] well if you don't want to. stop then what the [ __ ] is that she's saying she doesn't does it. too much okay that's the trick. though you can't do that the answer. is you can't do that. you you want to. stop you have to. stop entirely you can't be like i want. to you she has the answer. in her own [ __ ] question she was able. to stop drinking able to. stop smoking cigarettes but not able. to stop sugar why because she wants to. still keep sugar. in her life a little bit enjoy. it once in a while but that's not how you can [ __ ] think of it. you can't think of it. that way so she needs. you're saying she she needs to. stop or just not even bother. she needs to completely stop eating. sugar and or rather dedicate her. mind to completely stopping otherwise it's not. going to make a dent. well i understand that but like what about. how like sugar's almost at. everything so you're saying like don't even eat fruit. or you're saying oh she means [ __ ] sweets. oh well no some people don't eat sugar. they literally won't eat fruit. i don't think that's what you meant. yeah well i mean like that's what you can. do like you know learn. to [ __ ] love blueberries or some [ __ ] learn to. love strawberries but if eating smarties and you're wondering why your [ __ ] turns purple if you're doing it too much. you know well that's not really her. her inquiry i mean. i'm just saying that happened. to me though i know you ate so many smarties that. you should turn purple i. used to call. them somalis i know cause you can. talk and i [ __ ] and purple. came out and i called. mom worst three steps of all. time not not on the phone. purple came out i called a mom yeah i was like six and i i i was such a little [ __ ] shitty brat and i wouldn't eat anything. except smarties that i called. somalis and finally eventually i took a [ __ ] and i couldn't believe the color. of it and i called mom. from down the hall. do you remember the color. of it yeah it was purple. it was like a straw. oh dude yeah it's like a coffee. bean straw yeah uh all right. when i was older yeah. i ate too many. electric blue gushers electric blue. you know anything that is something. you eat that has the word electric in it. it's actually disgusting and i ate like three packs. or something in one. day what was your [ __ ] electric blue dude why was you why is your [ __ ] all different colors i got rainbow [ __ ] i've had one color. [ __ ] brown you're [ __ ] missing out and you're a loser you're a loser because you're not eating electric gusher you're a loser because you you only [ __ ] one color. you're a [ __ ] loser no all right. so i've i mean i [ __ ] brown and also like tan. a little bit but like yeah i don't know. i think you got to. stop you got to stop cold. turkey you can do it. but right now here's the thing. you're young live it up. i always say live it. up eat the sugar. dude spend your dad's money. while you still can you know. i'm talking about like [ __ ] live it up. dude pretty soon you. got your own bills you're not. gonna be able to.

[ __ ] man don't do it yet. yeah what is she 20. [ __ ] to eat you. know she looked young i mean. i don't know how much sugar. you're eating yeah that's the thing. it's like some people are like i'm addicted to. sugar and they just eat like a [ __ ] snickers every other day. it's like you're fine yeah. i mean she looks fantastic. you know it's not like she's [ __ ] obese but she's like she's worried about her. health yeah yeah yeah about being no

knocking me. off of all of my normal. thoughts because all i'm thinking about is how [ __ ] [ __ ] you sound okay okay absolutely [ __ ] obsessed with me and my sinuses all right let's go to. the next one babies. what's up papa chris. uncle matt it's your girl. katie calling in from nashville. let's go and jump into. it shall we wow so i'm gonna be 25 at the end of july. super super excited to begin. my quarter life crisis um and i've been dating. this guy for the past. two months um who happens. to be my first like real committed relationship. um you know i dated around. here and there in college. and stuff i just want to. do my own thing and he's like the first one. to really like stick. around which is nice um so no. complaints there but here's the thing that's been weighing on my mind. um so we met on the super. romantic medium that is tender. and i and he knows this. but i never would have like gone. for him have we not met. that way because he's 5'5 i'm 5. 10. um and i know that some guys. can feel like a little bit threatened. like masculinitywise around taller women. which like breaks my heart. because i myself have so much. love to give i just need a chance you know. um and and short kings need love too. so anyway um you know we've gotten side. eyes about this and i just do this. the whole spin move and like that's that's my thing. but like it still weighs. on my mind sometimes so i just wonder like like what. do you guys think about that. like why do you think it's a stigma. um have you dated taller. women in the past what was your. experience i'm just kind of curious. we're milking the [ __ ] out of it though i just so you guys know like for halloween he's going to. be a koala bear. i'm going to be a eucalyptus treat. oh it's going to. be great i love love. you guys uh thank you. guys so much for this podcast. chris i will see you in savannah. hell yeah and uh matt. love you so much. you're incredible you make this. podcast whole hope you know. that all right bye over. and out i will be in savannah. chrisley dot com but here's the thing. dude you're trying to. talk to i mean. are you trying to. talk yourself out of it. if he doesn't have a problem with it. then there's no problem she she if you listened what you. clearly i did problem she just wants. to know it sticks in her. mind a little bit this. stigma and she's wondering about what. we might think about it. she's not no problems anywhere she's just like one she's in her mind. she wants to. know sort of what we think about the general. height disparity height stigma between short men. and tall women but she did say my heart. goes out to him. like what if like you know. like i know that maybe there is like some she did. say that kind of [ __ ] what she didn't say that. kind of [ __ ] so wasn't listening. you know what i mean. listen 80 of it. no no i did dude. i i don't you know. let him be a [ __ ] koala dude. i i i have i ever dated a taller. girl hell yeah dude. i did a girl seven foot seven. foot one once no you didn't well. that is true i know. that because there's no such thing i did. date a girl that was six foot once. and with heel she was you know. sick told you it was. calls me i know i'm [ __ ] i really. am a tough drink. of water but uh uh yeah i don't think i've ever. dated a woman actually taller. than me but uh i definitely do know. men male friends who have dated women taller. than them yeah and some guys have to. all that matters is if the guy. gives a [ __ ] yeah that's the only thing that matters. yeah because if the guy doesn't give a [ __ ] then obviously nothing matters. because he doesn't care and then trickle. down nobody cares yeah but if the guy. [ __ ] cares if they're short but yeah if you guys then it's a [ __ ] problem because he acts [ __ ] weird then it [ __ ] everything up you know trickle up i'm cool with it yeah whatever i mean it's fine you know she's taller than me so what i mean most most people are talking what's that matter oh dude do you mind if i have that lollipop [laughter] the [ __ ] koala eucalyptus thing is good though you guys sound like you're doing [ __ ] great keep it up sounds like you didn't give a [ __ ] five five is whoo boy though yeah that's [ __ ] sure maybe maybe like i don't know i mean he's not done growing. yeah how old is he he's nine years. old oh [ __ ] dude no no no no no on the center of that tootsie dude [ __ ] hell yeah dude that's awesome that's cool man five ten five five that's crazy bro you know what have him get heals have him get heals not cause they don't care if he doesn't care he would really wear heels and just rock that [ __ ] no i don't give a [ __ ] whatever cheer please for dinner what was that what was that two please put the heels on me and my chick still shorter than her by three inches uh your five inches is is quite a bit yeah yeah man uh that's sick though what if he's got like a fetish you know yeah good for him yeah yeah true true if you like so good for everybody takes all kinds man he's [ __ ] killing he's a koala well if he likes yeah well wow 510 that's that's that's when a chick enters into. you're tall five nine yes but 510 okay. you're very tall for a check she's actually. a tall chick and she here's the thing. it's not that she's taller. than him it's that she's a tall. chick and he's a short. dude yeah right that's a big. discrepancy yeah like nobody would be like oh that's a dude. and also oh yeah like you you're describing. you'd be like yo you know. frank who the short guy. right okay oh the guy. with the [ __ ] tall chick. yeah the guy who's always a lollipop. you know i think in a weird. way it makes it easier. though he's like a short. guy she's a tall girl and it's like that. can become their thing they can lean the [ __ ] into. it when a guy is like five seven. and a girl's five nine. right she's not like a tall. woman he's not like a particularly. short guy ah then it's like a little bit weird. right you know what i'm saying. oh i see what you're saying. yeah they're in their [ __ ] roles yeah they got it locked down. they're good bro [ __ ] it man. the guy grew the guy's how he is you love. him that's awesome it's obviously real. love that's amazing yeah dude. yeah that that just goes to. show you uh the tricks. on tinder yeah the only story i ever. heard that made me actually think tinder. is good for yeah. because no way did. he say he was five five on. tinder right you gotta lead. with that when you're a dude. you gotta be like i'm this. how tall i am ladies. maybe not though yeah yeah i guess. so tricked her into. it he tricked her in. her whole relationship based on lies. no like the santa. claus thing yeah exactly he probably believes probably still believes in santa. claus because i'm seething about that. guy's [ __ ] wow we should have said life that guy's wife's mom [ __ ] pisses me off all right well i mean you know she needs a [ __ ] therapist or two wow all right let's do another one all right cool yeah what up chris and matt my name's delia it's just like your last name but without the apostrophe did you guys ever think if your last name was your first name i swear the mailman would 100 think you're a blackjack uh i'm not here to. joke although i got jokes. for days i do need advice. so my husband and i are having our 12th wedding. anniversary in a couple weeks and i have plans. to get like super dressed up and go. out to dinner and then drink 40s under a bridge. but i'm not sure if that's sufficient for an anniversary. and this year was especially tough we have a oneyearold. which by the way chris when you talk about calvin. it's like i'm staring into. my future and the future's so bright. i'm wearing sunglasses so i think maybe i should do something. more romantic but it still has to. be funny so any advice. would be much appreciated. uh by

[ __ ] they're gonna be having a good time they're gonna think that you're you're the [ __ ] and then maybe it will squash everything but why if not then you know the problem is on that because you you let out an olive rich right but what's the [ __ ] problem well we don't know she's not telling us but she didn't do anything well you don't know that so [ __ ] them all here's the thing i killed their family right she's not letting us know something i think she goes in next time she goes there she goes and sits between them and says real loud so what is it no that's they're just gonna be like what is it huh yeah okay let's do that let's act that out okay ready here we go i'm walking in so funny hey phil okay i just sat down no you don't have to. just sit there so what is it. uh so what is it. what is what are you turning. us what's what's the problem what's the problem. you got you're too loud. is the problem now at this. point no but you'll you'll you'll break him down you you it's not [ __ ] you know what i mean war i think it is though i think it's whatever she's leaving [ __ ] out in a way isn't it i think she's leaving [ __ ] out and i think whatever it is if she's if it's [ __ ] up enough for her to. call in something's up something's going. on and she wants to. stick a claim and say it's her. bar she needs to. [ __ ] swing her dick around so to. speak yeah not dick. because she has a vagina. right no i don't know. but i think that what you should do. is definitely just send around. and see how it goes from there. you could try that first yeah. do that first if it's nice. you'll you'll see you know. the bartender being like yeah it's from my heart. yeah and then it'll be like oh okay. and then oh thank you. oh hey you know but this is the thing. if you [ __ ] their friends or their boyfriends that's not a thing to. do right yeah because we don't really know what's going. on so send a round. of drinks unless you know secretly that. you did something you're not telling us. in which case then you just got to. put your [ __ ] hater shades on right. and block them out yeah. i think that's probably gonna end. up being the best. thing anymore okay sure send them around. see what happens yep yeah cool. all right great perfect. next one last one hey matt. and chris this is lindsay i'm leilani we're sisters. we are sisters i'm at the hospital. i'm in labor i'm gonna. deliver my second child's suit. i wish the machine. wasn't beeping in the background. that's like freaking driving me. nuts oops but it's okay. um we we move on. um we wanted to ask. for some advice about creating. our own podcast we have been a fan. of chris's for a long time. and since listening to. lifeline and listening to. you guys have a good time. and goof off and stuff it's inspired us to. start our own podcast. however we have no flippin idea what our content. should be so if you guys have any ideas. or suggestions let us know. or advices on how to. get us started let us. know thanks so much life. rips cute look you're not. going to know you're not. going to just start. did i start my pocket. i said no was going. to be about i still don't know. yeah but you get a following. if it's good if you guys. are good if there's something about you that. you like that people like then they'll tune. in they'll tune in also you got to. have a podcast you're a person. and everyone in the world. has a podcast now yeah okay. even people that don't even should even. people that shouldn't have podcast. honestly so whether you should you shouldn't you should have. one because everyone has black because they're people at your person. right yeah people you know. you could be like the it. could be [ __ ] uh whatever it is you know sisters. right sister sister podcast i think that might exist. but dude you could do it. sister's in labor always yeah. yeah sisters in labor. uh yeah i don't know. man i mean like you got to. have a podcast you're a person. so try it right. i think if they're looking for there. to be a topic though i think the answer. is what are things that. you both bond over as sisters. because if you don't want to. just be like [ __ ] congratulations where you just talk about [ __ ] no and [ __ ] the entire [ __ ] time no matter what the topic is hard hitting issues no we talk about the hardhitting issues if you want it to. be a topic it has to. be something that you already. bond over you can't like reach out. and be like oh i want it. to be about [ __ ] every sucker. is nish anyway right. now nowadays right that is the [ __ ] like if you love episode five of the mandalorian. then make it just about episode. five of the mandalorian. those people will find you dude. because people will find you you know. they got [ __ ] office ladies or whatever. it's like one of the most popular.
