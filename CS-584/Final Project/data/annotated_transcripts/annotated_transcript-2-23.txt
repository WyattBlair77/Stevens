i said it dude. he said it off. [ __ ] ah [ __ ] what are we gonna do i should be okay it's actually okay you know what just let it fly. it's so nice i remember aaron. paul was telling me. that because he's from there. and i was like all right. dude you know but is it. really that great dude. first time i performed there he came up to. watch with his family and friends bro name drop course but also he's a friend so go you know go [ __ ] yourself bro it was so good i'm like this place really is this really is bawling and he was like yeah man i told you uh so then got on the plane to. salt lake city god you gotta fly. which sucks gotta fly i don't like to. fly i don't like to. fly from i like to. fly in drive to. another one fly back i don't like to. fly in fly to. another one and then fly back right. because why because too much. jet lag to got to. salt lake city and this theater. the eccles theater is so good. then he said it best. he's like man this [ __ ] of rolls royce it is it's got the the stars on the top. and uh 2 500 people. came out whoopsie daisy. right they kept the same. seats warm but not too. warm right because they stand. up sometimes well they stand. up at the front and at the end. and then also sometimes in the middle don't they yeah. yeah yeah they do yeah. they do um that's like the holy. spirit in them they stand. up and they go yeah yeah um salt lake. city is another great place. because of here here's my theory. i have a theory do you want to. hear my theory on standup. and cities it's a great. theory and it's probably my best theory that's probably the most true of all my theories okay is if you're in if you're the best. places are to. perform in if you're a comedian. that pushes the envelope. and we know i push the envelope. because i want to. you know i'm going to. say what's funny not what's not. offensive right uh uh and yeah yeah and so i'm gonna push the envelope. and also i'm embattled right. so it's like either way i know you either. love crystalia or you hate. crystalia but those who ride. with me dude you know. what i'm talking about just vests. just leather vests on with spikes. on the shoulder so birds can't land. on us um but my theory about comedy. and cities is if you're somebody who pushes the envelope. as a comedian you they these cities who that. are either known as woke or religious. like goody twoshoes right. like salt lake city. is that's the idea of salt. lake city people like oh that's the mormon. place where everybody is just trying. to have family and you know they get they probably get offended. they probably just don't you did. you swear in front of them. or portland where you go. and you're like oh shoot. are they gonna uh you know. like they were trying. to pretend like there was gonna be a protest. for one of my shows. and there wasn't there. were two people out there. it was hilarious the media. was trying to be like dad. there was a pro there was a there's gonna be a huge protest everyone's. aligned and there were two people out. there with one sign and 2. 700 people walk by them. and so so uh so those are the best. cities to perform. in because they're known for that. and the people who like you as a comedian. are gonna make sure that you understand. that they're not that so they come out. and they laugh so and i you know. when i thought of this theory. in salt lake city. the first time i ever went. there i was like this. probably gonna be hard because there's like a lot. of people who are probably don't want me. to like say the things. i'm gonna say bro and i did it. and i was like why is this. crowd so good and they were like yeah. this car comes out. and i was like and then i thought about it. some more and then i noticed especially when i was in seattle. and and um portland those were two of the best. shows that i've had so yeah salt. lake was awesome um hey dude i'm gonna be real with you guys. sup with the uh you know. the dudes too but the but but the the women. in in salt lake city. okay dude we landed in salt. lake city a a a [ __ ] like lingerie model. got off the what got off a plane. uh a pilot with a pilot. hat on with her thing. and i'm like bro where everyone goes what the [ __ ] even the i was we were with everybody. lulu was a what in salt. lake city everybody dude the attractive. scale goes to. 11. the pilots are nines huh. the chick pilots hey what in in salt. lake city i saw a chick. i saw a female pilot first. of all how many honestly. female pilots do you see. what's the percentage and then how many of them. look like men high percentage. and on top of that. how many of them. look like unattractive men high. percentage dude this diamond. in the rough came out and you just go. oh huh and she's flying. planes all over the place. dude god imagine being on her. flight everyone's just we're gonna make me gonna make it oh oh that. yeah sorry i thought maybe the i didn't realize it. was gonna be you that came out. sorry dude just hi i'm your pilot. you know what i mean. it's gonna be a little bit of turbulence. so just like buckle up. or whatever hmm uh um we're gonna be serving. drinks wow you know it's just sexist. but it was crazy. dude and and and then at the show. the women that come out most fittest. women just like no fatsos in salt. lake city and i know that that's not true. but where are they right. they're probably on the outskirts the dudes. are just like hey and and the women are like just i mean. they look like god damn. dude so i'm just like okay. but also let's get on to. my family um salt lake. city is awesome man had such a good. time uh when i was on the way. to salt lake city. this drove me [ __ ] absolutely bonkers i was. on the plane i'm about about to. you know reward and i gotta go. to the bathroom right but i'm like i could wait okay. um was this a salt liquor. this is this was the boise. actually from lax to. boise i get on a plane. i gotta go to. the bathroom we're taking off as we take off i'm in the first. seat right and the the the the what do. you call them the stewardess is in the jump. seat right which is facing me. you know what i'm saying and i say uh hey uh i am. i um as we're taking off i say. hey will you do me. a favor to. the lady he says yeah i said is it. possible for you to. tell me when i can what the earliest time. is for me to. go to the bathroom. after we get in the air. because we're we're attacked we were getting. in the air and she says now. i say this why do i say this. because immediately all of a sudden. i'm gonna [ __ ] my pants. okay right and it's the most inopportune. time because i'm strapped in i can't do it. right i can't go to. the bathroom because i mean. dude you're not gonna stop me. i'll tell you that i'm not gonna [ __ ] my pants. there's no way that's happening. we could be taken off. and as we're taken off i'm gonna shoot. my pants or [ __ ] in the bathroom. i'm gonna go to. the bathroom so i'm gonna take the thing. off i'm gonna be it'll be like inception. where i'm trying to. like you know climb the walls and then i'm gonna get into. that bathroom and just you know. what i mean try my best. to only get it. in the toilet but i say to. where i say when let me know. please the earliest time and she says i will okay. sounds good we just have to. get a little bit higher. so we can level. out and i say fantastic. i'm gonna hold it until. then now i didn't like that i had to. do that but i needed to. know when the earliest time. was because now i know what's going to. happen is whenever she knows. it's possible to. do it she goes. she's going to go. like this go ahead look at me. and say go ahead. so i got this [ __ ] right nobody's gonna get the bathroom. before me all right now. there's two dudes next. to me one who's right. next to me he's a big. fan he's from orange county. okay and he's talking to. me mostly you know he's talking to. me because he's a fan. but he's also mostly talking to. me because he's live about six drinks. in [ __ ] um 30 minutes of the flight or 30. minutes after we sat down. which is we're taking off and then there's another guy. across the way right. it's two seats me and a guy. and then one across the way. this dude after i say hey can i you tell me. no when i could go to. the bathroom early and stuff. this dude leans in to. the to the steward on the jump. seat and says hey she says yeah and he says can i go. after him [music] hey dude what are you doing. what are you doing let's let's explore. all these options okay. first of all

[ __ ] three years that i've been like actually i was thinking about this. the last three years just how [ __ ] hard it's been for like me and my family and all that just like with the recovery. and all that and i'm just so grateful. that everyone of like my shows. are sold out uh and that people come to. see me and um you know. it's been a long road. of recovery and it's hard. and it's you know um it's a lot. it's just uh constant work i'm working. on myself that i have to. do and that um to. make sure i keep you know. my shot of the street. clean and i'm just grateful. for everybody that's been um like along. my journey and really been following. it you know i mean. i know i know that the [ __ ] look the media. is the media and it's going. to do what it does. um and it's [ __ ] up because uh uh you know my wife and i are trying. to [ __ ] navigate through the past. three years and it's hard. but i you know people say. to me like oh thank you. for coming i wanna see people. say i thank you for coming. back a lot in the meet and greets. they say thank you so much. for for coming back and and finding a way. to get back on stage. and talk about all this stuff. and recovery especially because i deal. with a lot of like a lot. of addicts are coming to. my shows and all that um and they you know. they talk to. me about it afterwards. and i i want to. be very clear that um if it wasn't for because someone was asking me. literally today they were like how do you deal. with she was asking me. about this i ran into. her and she was asking me about this. because she was going. through [ __ ] and she's like how do you cope with the things that people say about you uh that aren't true. the things that people say. about you that make you feel like [ __ ] and um i i this is what made me think of this. because like i've done so much work on myself. over the past three years. and a lot of therapy. and it's really it's really hard. to deal with because she was going. through her own thing she was talking about this. and um i was telling her. it's not easy but you have to. know who you are in the face. of people who are telling you that. you're something that you're not and um so for that. i'm grateful for everybody. that rocks with me but i i want to. say that you can't get past. [ __ ] without being grateful. and for me the number you don't don't thank. me thank the reason why i'm back. doing what i'm doing is because of my wife. the reason why is because of my family. i talk about this in my act. but my wife held me. the [ __ ] down and there was no way i could have gotten through. that without her and yes of course without calvin. and now william however they can't really have complex. conversations and the conversations that. i've had with my wife throughout these past. years of struggle uh. mentally and through sobriety and all that stuff just she you know i was thinking about this. now too because the guy was talking about get don't date. a modern woman like whatever. a modern woman is like you know. that's funny that he's talking about. that and i'm making fun of it. but that she is a woman who is now. so you could argue she's a modern woman. this woman is i mean. an angel sent to. earth it's unbelievable how she has helped me. and you know i used to. hate when people say like she this. person's my rock but man. it's it's tough when you're broken. and and someone else has to. take the weight and they make you better. and uh so i guess in a way. i'm saying don't thank me. thank her uh i would not. be here if it wasn't for her. and i would not i would certainly not. be doing um these uh these podcasts. um so that's that i you know. i don't like getting serious. on this podcast but sometimes i i like it you know um but anyway i i just appreciate you. you [ __ ] man like you're so awesome. and i'm so grateful for. you um and uh you know. that's it i don't know. people [ __ ] identify with that. at all or not but that's what's up. and then the bottom line is you know. it's all fun and games until i'm unreachable so uh uh there was a thing by the way. also also you know what we went to. uh the day i got back. from salt lake city. i went to. uh i got home i was so tired. i don't even know why. it wasn't a long. flight or anything and i got enough. sleep over the weekend but we went. i said let's go because i you know. i said let's take calvin. william was already asleep um with the nanny. but i was like let's take calvin. alice do something what do. you want to. do when chris was like i don't know i was like let's go. somewhere and she said uh okay and so we said what. do you want to. do calvin and he said i'll get hot. chocolate so we went anybody calls. he says because he knows i like coffee. so i was like let's go get coffee. so it's really cute. so i want to. go get coffee and then we walked by an ice cream place. and calvin fell asleep. on my arms and then we went. to the ice cream place. and we're like buddy wake up. and he was not waking up. we got the ice cream. and we showed him. the ice cream and my buddy. wake up and he opened his eyes. and looked at ice cream. and then closed his eyes. back again and then kristen was like do you want ice. cream and he goes like this. and so we took the thing. and we get gave it to. him and he had his eyes. closed and he goes. like this i mean she put it in his mouth. and he ate it and he goes and he's sleeping. eating ice cream sleeping the kids. got the life what is this.
