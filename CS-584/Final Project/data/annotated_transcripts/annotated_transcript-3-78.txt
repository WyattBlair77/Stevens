[ __ ] now stack racks to. the [ __ ] ceiling okay yeah i'm in right. like it's always the rich guy that's like you know. i don't think money makes me. happy and it's like that's because you got it. it's cause you got it. um so i was watching joe millionaire. and you know we were talking. about it watching it. and [ __ ] and you know kristen sometimes like to. pretend like she doesn't like reality. shows when in actuality she likes reality. shows shows because she's female right if you're a female you love reality. shows okay i don't make the rules. but that's how it is if you're a guy that likes reality. shows you like it because you're making fun of it. and if you're a girl that likes reality. shows you like it because you like it and even though. sometimes you say you're watching it. ironically what you're doing is trying. to fit in with the boys. because we know you secretly like it. because you because you're a chick. because you smell nice right. um so you like watching it. if you're a chick that's it. i don't make the rules. but that's how it is and yeah. now did my therapist ask if did my couple. surpass ask if it bothered kristen that. i called call women. chick sometimes yes she did did chris. say it doesn't bother. her yes she did she's on my side. but does it secretly bother. her i have no idea should i call. them women yes but does it. matter no is it the lingo. that the comedians just yes. but i'm only 41 right i'm not even 42. yet gonna be 42 soon. but i'm not yet so still he says checks all. right um get deeper. issues so it's all good. but we're watching joe millionaire. and then all of a sudden kristen. just decides to. say and by decides to. she would she would be so pissed. off i said she decides to. say because she would just be like why. don't you just say i say it. why are you saying i decided to. say it like it's not how i actually feel and she's right. yes dude get deeper issues. but it's all good because we're chilling. in bed and we're having a good. time and she says she decides. to say and also she says i don't can we turn. this off it doesn't make me feel good and i said what why. and she's like i don't know it's like sad. these women are like you know. fighting for attention and they all. want this and that and then the guys and this and that and i and i was like can we just like you. know can we just like watch i'm like enjoying. watching it you know. and and we're just chilling. in the bed and we're up. here in the bed because you don't like to. watch tv downstairs do you even. though it's like the cool. hanging out spot that's the thing. about she loves watching tv. in bed and just vegging the [ __ ] out. she'll be like come on let's go. upstairs and watch tv in the bed. and i'm like that's not my bag. though right bed is for sleeping. that is for sleeping and doinking. and that's it okay the bed. is for sleeping and doinking. but mostly sleeping because you do. mostly sleeping and you want to. drink in the bed you can. drink in the bed but you want. to bring food in the bed. your boy's not about that. life dude she'll eat chips. and meatballs in the bed. and i'm like dude the bed's. for sleeping and dunking okay all right. you get it but downstairs. what's downstairs for downstairs the common. area the chill zone the where the fireplace. is yeah we've got a fireplace. in our bedroom oh okay. so sue me buddy's got more. than one fireplace and it's all. good but the bedroom is for sleeping. in dunkin and the downstairs. area common room living area is where it. where you can do so much. [ __ ] i mean you could do eating you could do [ __ ] sl you could do chilling napping. you could do you could do sleeping. you could do hey it's hangsville and guess. what you can also do. doinking right you can. pretty much drink anywhere you. can pretty much sleep almost anywhere. i've slept at a baseball game. before not even just in a box. i was at a baseball. game like in regular seats. and i slept can't. don't get a baseball but you can sleep. anywhere if you're really gangster about it. anyway so i like to. sleep down i like to. watch tv downstairs and party do it. i like to eat and i like to. watch tv because i like to. have two stimulations in my in at once. right like one stimulation is eating. and another stimulation is watching whatever the [ __ ] i want to. watch right fear thy neighbor or joe millionaire or boardwalk empire or a documentary right that's what i do so she's like let's watch it upstairs so okay i acquiesce even though it's just 11 o'clock and your boy likes to. stay up to way. way late i acquiesce because i want. to hang out and it's fun. to be with more people rather. than less people so i'm watching joe. millionaire and all of a sudden she hits. me with can you turn it. off it makes me. feel bad so now what do i feel. slighted so now what do i feel. slighted okay but that's what i feel. but should i or should i not. i don't know but that's how i feel and i've come to. this podcast to be honest. with the public here okay. so what does it make me. feel slighted all right now. is that on me. or is it not on me. i don't know it's probably. on me that i didn't. say well you know what i came up. here and i didn't want to. and i wanted to. hang out with you but it makes me. feel slighted because i want to. watch the tv show and you're kind of just mostly ticktocking on your phone. and i don't get to. now watch what i want to. watch and i want to. be downstairs because she says well why don't you just. go downstairs and watch it. and i said because i want to. be up here and then she says well i don't like watching this. and i said okay but i want to. watch it and it makes me happy. so do you actually want me. to not watch it and she said yeah. just go downstairs and i said all right. and i turned it off and now the tv. is not on and now i'm not ready. to go sleep and i'm [ __ ] my eyes. are wide as [ __ ] open so now i'm not now now i'm i come here to. be honest with you guys. and i come here to. talk about it and maybe just be good and and you know. and chill out but this is the real. [ __ ] that's going on in my mind. right yeah your boy's got props. but your boy's trying to. [ __ ] right look at the situation. and be open about it. so she says yeah i really don't want you. to watch that show it makes me. feel bad and i said oopsie. daisy i said suck. it up whoops oh he said suck. it up didn't he i said can't. you just suck it. up oops oh god. was it the right. thing to say or the wrong. thing to say no. whammies no whammies no whammies no whammies or [music]. was can't you just suck. it up the right. thing or the wrong. thing to say no. hemis nominees no women's the women's. the whims or he says just go. downstairs and i said but i don't want. to that's what you can. do you know that if you ever. get into a real heart. now kristen and i barely argue but if you ever. get into a real argument. with you with your girl. or your guy or whoever it. is and they say go. sleep downstairs go sleep. on the couch dude you could just say no. did you know that i didn't. really realize that until i did it. once and then guess what we did. we just both fell asleep. and woke up dandy as [ __ ] dude he cracked the code if your chicks if your chick tells you to. sleep on the couch you just hit her. with the now [music] because the couch is for eaton and hangsville and doinking. but not really sleeping but the bed. is and the bed is for sleeping. and doinking and so now. we're either sleeping or doinking. and i'll tell you which one we're not doing. doinking so i didn't. go downstairs and we huffed and puffed and whatever you know. we did that kind of [ __ ] and she turned over and she was still ticktocking and i go like this. all right well i'll just go to. sleep couldn't full suit for hours. [ __ ] you could he fall asleep for hours. no he couldn't oh god. it affected him more than it would have three years. ago because he was selfish. and now he's opening. up doors to. his emotions oh god so i'm sitting there. can't fall asleep my legs. are activated right. i mean you know maybe it's because i ate some [ __ ] coffee ice cream. but my legs were activated. you know i suffered with rls then that's not even counting. all the other stuff ocd. anxiety ptsd [ __ ] right darkness i suffer from darkness i do he suffers from depression what can he say he suffers from darkness so um buddy but but he tries to. rise like a phoenix and that's why i'm at phoenix in april 30th. that's the first date i'm doing out. of town phoenix crystalia. dot com but my point. is what was my point. i have [ __ ] absolutely no idea. i have no idea and that's just the way. it's gonna be but so we watched. joe millionaire and i [ __ ] i don't even remember what the whole. goddamn point was yes dude [ __ ] yeah i actually had a grand point [ __ ] i don't even remember it but it doesn't matter dude so that's what we were doing we were watching the [ __ ] thing and it all got [ __ ] up and ah you're with me you're with me you're with me dude i don't i don't know this isn't an act this isn't standup and [ __ ] i gotta figure my [ __ ] out why do sometimes you get so angry though dude right like sometimes i just get so angry and [ __ ] i gotta just calm down man you know i was on a pa i was my last podcast i talked about my my friend getting uh uh mad about taking pictures of a dog in the diner which was a [ __ ] funny story and i was joking around how about he is autistic i want to. be clear he wasn't autistic he's not. autistic if he was autistic. i would i would it's it's cool. i understand it's a thing but he's not he's just instead. just a guy who takes pictures. of dogs at a diner which is weird. as [ __ ] um so yeah but yeah so so oh so i oh this was my whole. point so i woke so oh so i so i spiraled last night so i was in my bed. couldn't fall asleep uh you know. decided to just kind of like you. know i was texting friends. we were joking around. but then i'm like my phone. keeps me up dude i mean. you know kristen says her phone. makes her go to sleep. when she's just on ticktock or doing [ __ ] uh what do you call. it uh crosswords sometimes. she does like crossword puzzles. and she says it puts. her to sleep. or she listens to. [ __ ] podcasts dude and one of the reasons why it kept me up. is because she listens to. murder podcasts which is okay. and i like because sometimes i get that's the thing. sometimes there's too much. on my mind if i could focus on one. thing like i put on keith. morrison on dateline and it's just like ah there. she was there she was lisa she was. a nice person but what she didn't. know was she's about to. get a rude awakening [music]. dateline right so it had to. be weird standing there alone. not knowing where the blood came from but there was another person. ah um there was another person. lurking in the shadows ah you ever. watched that podcast or listen. to it so anyway. um so now i'm up and her phone's on. and i i don't you know. she's got her phone and the podcast. is playing the podcast. and then after that after that dateline. i don't know what the [ __ ] her playlist. is but it goes right. to keith moore i i like kind of like dip. out of thinking about it. for a while because my brains just focus on. too many things i'm starting. to listen to. the date line okay but then my brain. starts to focus on other. things and when i'm really only focused. on the day on episode. i can start to. fall asleep but then i'm focusing and start to. focus on other things because i realize i'm oh man. i'm almost falling asleep. and i get excited that. my legs get activated. right i mean it's all nuts. oh [ __ ] but then what happened. is almost throw up in my mouth. is it goes and i realized keith. morrison is still talking and he's referencing. so many [ __ ] christmas shits like he's talking about santa and like he's talking about the north pole. and i'm like where the [ __ ] was this person murdered dude. like did penguins [ __ ] you know what i mean. it was this murder was. this murder by a [ __ ] elf. like and there his hat. i know the only thing that was left. were two slippers that pointed. upwards and a small green hat. and i'm just like what the [ __ ] and then i realized it's the story of the grinch. and i'm like am i sleeping. what am i doing is. this is this a dream i'm having and then i really listen. and dude they hired keith. morrison to tell a christmas. story to tell how the grinch. stole christmas and now this is what's [ __ ] being played on our podcast. and she's i mean just so far. under under her conscience i mean. she is just like she's like so far. sleeping that she's in the van. with leonardo dicaprio falling. into the [ __ ] ocean with [ __ ] uh ken wantanabe and [ __ ] what's his name what's his name the [ __ ] guy who's bane kent wantanabe and [ __ ] bane and leonardo dicaprio and kristen just like this because the grinch stole christmas. is being narrated by keith. overlander or whatever the [ __ ] his name is keith. morrison i need she's just fallen. and i'm awake now i'm listening. to the grinches on the other side. i can't [ __ ] turn the thing. off so now i got to. listen to the grinch. and now now i'm like all right. well i'm up but it's 3am. but i'm like okay i'm up. but i can't fall asleep. but i'm wide my eyes. are so my eyes become a large and so i can't fall asleep. and then i just start thinking about like finances. and i'm just like [ __ ] man. shit's banging now and i'm you know. i'm making money and i'm doing. my thing and i'm yeah. i'm selling out rooms and [ __ ] and like i have podcasts and all that and extra paper scoop. that up and all that's good. but it's like dude what happens. when you're 65 that's what i start. thinking you know i get retirement. and all that [ __ ] and you're not spending as much but also what happens. when you're 70 and 75 and then i'm like i'll be fine. but then i'm like well how many kids am. i gonna have and then i'm like well i want them. to be fine and then i just start. going into this. crazy [ __ ] tailspin and i get nervous and then i [ __ ] had to. ah dude i i you know. i haven't done this. in a long time. but he got out the paddle and canoe do it. and he took a trip to. zanny island and i'm sorry. dude my mom i'm so sorry. but he went to. [ __ ] zanuck he went to. zany island but my mom is so sorry. dude but he took point. five and even though. it was in [ __ ] christians for purse. even though it was just in christmas. kristen's purse and i could have went in and got it. in christmas press i did. i went and i got it. in christmas purse and then i realized that oh my god i forgot. that we were out the other night. and she spilled wine all in her purse. and the wine got into. the xanax and then i took the xanax. with the wine all over it. it was in the xanax. bottle and i took it in the xanax. tasted chocolate but it also it tasted chalky. but it also tastes. like the [ __ ] wine and so now i'm like is it okay i don't drink it. they say don't mix drink. and drugs and but now i'm [ __ ] taking the xanax. with the soap the wine. soaks xanax and so now. i'm like is that gonna be okay. for me really and oh i'm spiraling again. and i'm so [ __ ] nervous but guess what happened. dude the xanax took effect. so the 0.5 came through and your boy went. to [ __ ] never neverland story was a mess but now you know how it is so i woke up feeling bad is my whole point which is why i started to. talk about this pockets and i will tell you i had no idea what i was going. to talk about in this. pocket before i started i have about four things. to talk about and i didn't hit one. yet but i'm telling you that. i woke up and i just had oh the dream. was what i was to. tell you about jesus. christ he goes off on tangents. johnny goes off on tangents. and that's fine though because you're with me. it's a roller coaster just like life. so i woke up at seven. all good my babies stayed up. for about a half an hour. that's what we do it. that's how we do it. went back to sleep. and what happens when your boy. goes back to sleep. after he wakes up does. anybody know class yes hi mr. delia yes hello you hi. you have terrible dreams. about dying or people. beating you up or people. raping you or something like that. you get a gold star you've been listening congratulations. you get an a plus do sometimes. you have uh dreams about people. forcing watermelons in your mouth. a plus johnny and does. it hurt real bad and do you think about oh how are you gonna [ __ ] swallow this and maybe you might choke to. death and instead of that. your chest explodes a. plus johnny that's when i have those. horrible dreams from 8 30. to 9 30. so i did. i had a [ __ ] dream where i had to. go paintballing and i was in the lobby. and instead i [ __ ] met a gang of white dudes. and they beat the [ __ ] out of me. and they kept doing it. and i kept saying but i need to. be with calvin and i need to. be with calvin and they kept kicking the [ __ ] out of me. and i was like but i need to. be with calvin i'm calvin's. dad and then i woke up and it was just so bad. it actually felt so bad. i woke up and i went down. to go hug calvin and he was playing in the water. that little tub that i i put water. in sometimes and kristen was down. there and i looked at him. and i and he said hi. dada and i was like hi. buddy and then he came over. and he gave me a hug. and then i sat down and then kristen's like what's wrong. and i was like i had horrible. dreams she's like oh i'm sorry. and i haven't been able. to shake it all day. i don't know i mean. it's just a paintball gang i get it. but it's like it made me feel like [ __ ] [ __ ] dude people were like kicking me when i was down they were like kicking my chest and in my stomach and stuff and i know i got that because we were trying to. watch [ __ ] fear thy name or but fear that neighbor before joe millionaire and a woman said that the guy was kicking her while he was down and so now i had a dream about that so it's great cool great violence. is everywhere where's hawkeye. when you need him but um so yeah so it's been a struggle. today honestly i've been in a really.

[ __ ] i mean one of these two that will release it let's watch this again. and then i'll get back to. the story the button and that releases. it and then after you let go it. locks look now it's like

ladders go up and that's it. why would you want to. walk across the [ __ ] [ __ ] this is the dumbest event this is why it's so [ __ ] funny hey listen just walk right up yeah but then you stop and have to. go across like you're a goddamn monkey dude. it's very safe it's adorable and it's like scaring. me so really now it's locked in place. i was so scared but then overcame that scaredness with confidence and that's why i love this. guy see now it's locked in place. okay so really you say oh god. harold are you okay actually i didn't have it. locked yeah no [ __ ] harold. oh my god that one. that one was the winner up. until the [ __ ] chocolate croissants if you i'm not gonna look at chocolate croissants. again if you haven't seen that. episode just google chrisley chocolate. croissants it's the [ __ ] funniest clip i've ever seen on on on the internet. dude i i i and and honestly. i get it a lot. of people are like this. isn't funny but to. me that is my [ __ ] goddamn humor dude it is so funny. and i break it down. for you guys so you know. why i think it's funny. but anyway so now i'm friends with a latino. who takes his shirt. off all because of that. but um so i so i go there. i go to the coffee. bean and i i um i get my americana you know how i do it right. and when i go to. get my iced americano. um [music] i uh i see this. guy he's always got his shirt. off and he's facetiming whoever it. is i don't know he might be on live. talking to fans for some reason. i think he's a singer. a latino singer because he's really. good looking am i racist. i don't know but he's got a ferrari. and he obviously does something. pretty high high profile okay. maybe he's not a singer. maybe he just invests i have no idea. but is it racist. i think he's a latino. singer yeah probably but whatever. what are you gonna do cancel me. so um so he's got the ferrari. and then i brought up with the i came through. with the bloody guts mobile and he's like you like that and i'm like here we go we're gonna be friends i know it. just i attract these [ __ ] dude i really do so so i look at the i go. oh yeah and check the insides. dude and i check the insides. and he goes like this. oh wow look at that. because why because it's bleeding. all over the place he says let me get some towels i like chill. chitchill it doesn't even come you. know it's so good it's just part. of it and uh and he was like yeah. i really like it i really like it. he's like i've been thinking about getting. one of these i was like oh man. it's so good you need it. because because it's because i got this car. in that car in this. car in that car and i'm like oh he's got lots. of cars but none of them. are comfy you're driving a rari and you're driving. some other things that aren't that. comfy and he's like i might get a bentley. i was like dude dude. dude you're talking to. the [ __ ] right and wrong guy if you want a [ __ ] suv you got to. get the [ __ ] rsq8 that's what you gotta get okay because he was talking about getting the [ __ ] culling in i'm not into. the culinary and i get that it's nice. but no no no no no no it's [ __ ] too much money. for all that [ __ ] so uh so i say to. him all right bro. we rap a little bit talk. a little bit and we say. hey bro good to. see you good to. meet you i'm chris too and then we take a [ __ ] high five and by the way. the whole time he's on a facetime. call but just not just holding it not. even talking to the guy. which is just like the most famous. thing you could possibly. do is be on a facetime. but not be talking to. the person and having a fullon conversation. with someone else so he goes like this. and we we hug and that's when the the absolute i should have known. i should i should have known. this i mean how many times a day. do you go of course. if it's one this was the time. that i would have used it. we hug boom boom puff draw car. noir should have known that drock. are noir was gonna [ __ ] tickle. under my nose like pizza in a donald. duck movie right that [ __ ] waft of pizza like a daffy duck you know what i mean like that smoke. that smoky thing but i was more. like this because i don't like draco noir. i don't like colombia in fact. there's no cologne there's only perfume. so i i didn't want to. tell this guy because i just met. him hey guy there's only perfume. just so you know you're not wearing cologne. but now i drive home. and it's got it all like like i'm it's all. on me and i'm i'm smelling the drunkard noir. and then i get home. and i'm like it's also i'm wearing a new sweater. it's i just put it on for the first. time and so now i'm like all right. i got to wash. it which is fine. but it's going to. take a little bit of the fabric. away the softness of it. right but it's okay though. dude so i get home. and i'm like oh man. smell this and my assistant's like oh wow. and then i say smell. this to kristen she's like i don't smell. anything and i'm like okay. all right fine that's fine. dude i'm gonna go watch your millionaire. [applause] so now i have a friend every time i go to. coffee bean teal if i saw him. again yet today he was there. all good dude but yeah so you know. what this podcast is making me. feel better you guys are. good thank you for being there. for me i mean it. i mean on honestly. honestly i did some shows. this week um i did. one at uh the laugh or two. or three at the lab. factory and then one at um improv. on on melrose one. or two at the improv. of melrose i think i did. two and then i did one. at jam in the van. which is a cool um spot in culver. city i think i said it. was century city but it's culver. city and um it was fun. it was a great room. and i didn't know this happened. but i got on stage. and somebody says do the drunk. girl bit and i'm like did. how like do you can you i like this. was [ __ ] 12 years ago. i did this bit more. even and um so i said oh you guys shut the [ __ ] up like real quick and then everyone laughed and then and then in the front row. uh a woman fell in the front. row like i guess trying to. get out of her seat. and i kind of ignored. it because i was like i was in the middle. of my act and i'm talking about. [ __ ] and and then i was like okay i'll ignore that. and then after i get off stage. my friends come up to. me and they're like did. you see that woman pass. out during your show and i was like no she actually didn't pass. out i said she just kind of fell i think she was trying. to leave the seat. and they were like no no. no in the back somebody was just watching you. and then [ __ ] passed out out of their seat and i was like what and they were like yeah you didn't see it and i was like no somebody [ __ ] passed out and they're like yeah you just kept going i guess it's good they're like it's good you kept going and you didn't see it because it would have ruined your act and you would have you would have talked about it and you would have had to. get back on track. and i was like this. really happened and then apparently they like put her up. back up in a seat and like tried to. make sure she was okay. i had no idea the [ __ ] went down it's not even that. big of a room and then i'm and then they were like yeah we thought that if you kept on going. it was gonna be another travis scott incident and i was like that's exactly. my point when i was talking about the travis scott thing. when everyone online [ __ ] lit me up. after i talked about it. dude there was like 150 people in the room. i had no idea a chick [ __ ] passed out. in the back and everyone's mad because [ __ ] in a sea of 50. 000 people at a travis scott concert. that he think it's his fault. that he didn't stop the show. because somebody ate a molly. like how the [ __ ] is he supposed. to know i had no idea. that this [ __ ] person passed out. but it's a great venue. and i was like jesus. is she okay i had no. [ __ ] idea and uh apparently she's probably okay though they didn't make much of a big deal. about it but anyway dude. i did it it was a fun. venue i like doing um jam in the van. thank you jam in the van. and uh you know laughter. and improv you guys are [ __ ] great. i've got another show in irvine. improv coming up whatever he's starting. to do theaters. i got other [ __ ] dates coming up. so be ready different cities. um but she [ __ ] passed out i couldn't believe it. i was at the lab. factory actually the other night and when i was doing my lab. factory show um i noticed in the front. row so calvin loves. this this tub thing that i fill with water. and he takes the cup and he and he takes the cup and he and he puts. and he just basically takes the cup fills it. with water and then empties it back. out he does it 400 times. i'm sitting there and i'm watching him. and sometimes you know if you have kids. or whatever uh even if you don't maybe. you do this with other people. but like when you have kids. you can be with your kids. and it's always great but sometimes at least if you're a sentimental. person or if you try. to live in the moment. i guess i don't know whatever. you want to. call it there's a bunch of hokey ways. to [ __ ] say it but you know calvin has really opened me up in the emotional like i said i was talking to. my therapist once and she was like well you you used. to live with your walls. up and you used to. keep people at arm's. length and i absolutely did i absolutely. did that and then over the past. two years i've really been opened up and she said well you're not gonna be able. to do that anymore. because you gotta just you gotta grow. and we were talking about calvin. and she said you know. how you like to. have your emotional walls up. all the time i said yeah. she says well you're [ __ ] with calvin. cause they're gonna come down. anyway because she knows who i am and how i am and i was like you're right. and i i started to. cry when she said that. which you know okay. we're both doing our job. her as a therapist and me as a patient. person so um patient. slash person not a patient. person i am not a patient. person i want the [ __ ] right now but anyway so i'm sitting there and i'm watching calvin's pick up the cup uh and fill it with water. and putting the water. back into the tub. and every time he does. he says i got the cup. dada i got the cup. dada i got the cup. and i'm and he's doing this. and it's not just like i'm hanging out. it's like my walls are down. and i'm actually living in this moment. taking it in but not trying. to take it in i just allow. myself to take it in i relax. you know i i i'm just looking. at him and i'm thinking about how great. this moment is and how beautiful it is that. he just simply has got this cup and he's telling me. 400 times and he's saying i got the cup. dada and every single time. i'm saying yeah you got the cup i'm saying. it back and it's a beautiful. moment it's all that i need honestly. at this point it's all. that i need all right. i get it you need electricity and money and food. but at this single moment. right now this moment. this connection with my son is all i need and it's basic. as [ __ ] and i love it and i'm emotional about it. and we sit there and we do it. a lot until he gets bored. usually we do this. [ __ ] until i gets bored but i you know because that's what it's like being a parent you're like okay good yeah good good buddy but i just he had the cup 400 times. and i told him. yeah you got the cup 400. times so that moment. ends and i go about. my day and it makes me. feel good you know the day. happens ups and downs in a day. and i just keep doing the rest of my day. and then i have a show at the laugh. factory and when i'm on stage i notice in the front row. there's a father son. and of course it's not father. son like me and my son. my son's two and i'm 41. they're at a comedy. club so the son's at least 18. he was probably in his early. 20s and the dad. was late 50s or so and i'm looking at them. and i get this feeling of when i first started. standup when i first started. stand up and i thought i don't know if people are gonna like me or if i had a bomb or if i was on stage and struggling and some people weren't. laughing i would think it's okay. because my family and my parents. my father my mother they. think i'm funny and they know. me and i can get through. this rough show because they have my back i would actively think that and it would make me. feel better and i would feel confident. and i'm fortunate that i had a great. childhood that i'm who i am now. and can access that because i've been watching a lot. of videos on youtube. now called it's from the soft. white underbelly which is unbelievable. and they talk to. people who were like abused and [music]. taken advantage of and and prostitutes. and just people who are con. mans and hackers and people who have messed up. lives you know ku klux klan. members um people who have been prison. in prison for 10. years and every one of these people have the same story when i grew up. my dad or my mom. wasn't there so i'm fortunate i'm very fortunate i am. in this position that. i had a good childhood. and i'm on stage talking to. these people and not everyone's gonna think i'm funny. but when a crowd didn't think i was funny. i would think yeah dude. but i always made my dad. and mom laugh i would actively think. that and this father's son. reminded me gently of that but instead of really feeling that emotion. is purely as i used. to when i was on stage. i thought of you know. i always identified with the sun but instead during this. moment i thought wow and i'm on stage. and i'm doing my jokes. but i'm also thinking this is so cool. that this father is able. to share this moment with his son. so i wasn't thinking about really being my dad's son. and going to this. show in the front row. i was thinking about being me. calvin's father and taking calvin to. a show one day so everything. had been different it was a bit. the same because it was family. but it was like i grew into. the other role which is what. you hope to do in your life. is grow so i'm thinking wow. and i'm noticing some people in the audience. are not laughing it. was a good set i was having a good. show but there's always people who are just not laughing. whether or not they think you're funny. maybe they had a bad day. or maybe they just don't like you maybe they're just in a bad. mood and they don't want to. laugh and they're not laughing. at anybody or maybe they laugh. on the inside but instead. of thinking my dad and my mom. have my back i thought i need to. get through these moments of not making these people. laugh in in a symbolic way. these moments of things that are way. worse than that hardships even you know. everyone goes through [ __ ] and even during those hardships i would be like my my parents got me you know i'm fortunate to. have them and they've given me and instilled me. the confidence to. get through these moments now i'm thinking looking at this. father son i can get through. these moments as little or as big. as they might be not because calvin. has my back but because i have to. have calvin's back i am calvin's. dad and i have to. get through these moments for him. as little or as big. as these moments are and it's so interesting. too because i thought about it. after i get off stage i thought about how wow i didn't actually. think about calvin having my back. and that made me happy. because i think that honestly. five years ago. if i did have a kid. living the way i was living all. for me selfishly you know. and just stacking money. you know trying to. sleep with women whatever it. was i think that i would have thought. calvin has my back and i'm lucky. but instead of that i didn't have that. thought i thought i have to. have calvin's back and that to. me made me feel the best. because it was like this. moment where i was like oh [ __ ] man all this therapy may be working because it's not about me and i know it's not about me anymore. you know i don't know it. was a longwinded story what i just told but it was such a i'll never forget. that moment man. it's like sure calvin can have that. cup but i have calvin's. back so um yeah that's that that was a that was a wild. that was a wild. thing for me to. realize and just come to. during being on stage it's so funny. comedians think of um all this. short sort of you're on stage. and you think of the craziest [ __ ] you're on stage and you're like whether you're like oh yeah you know i mean i had this whole. [ __ ] fantasy about this father son and i was on stage talking to. everything and uh talking about doing my act my act that i do. all the time and doing trying. some new [ __ ] or doing the [ __ ] that works and um you know sometimes you're on stage you're like oh it's so hot oh yeah i remember that one time it was so hot when i was [ __ ] growing. up in the [ __ ] i mean do you just think about this [ __ ] like remember that one time i was at the [ __ ] beach and this and that you just think of all sorts of [ __ ] you're trying to. be on autopilot but that's what happens. um so i had that whole fantasy. during my during my [ __ ] so you know some shows you go and you see and you have beautiful moments with uh fathers and sons and some moments some shows you go you have and you're uh and a chick passes. out in the back row. and you don't even realize it. um but yeah anyway this show soft. white underbelly is [ __ ] crazy. you got to check it. out it's so good um how about this [ __ ] i i guess blm jumped the shark dude and you know i can say that now because people are i put on my instagram story it's like hilarious but they put [ __ ] they put [ __ ] uh uh jessie small he's so he's got he's got um what do you call it 150 days in prison or whatever for making fun for making fun for pretending like he got mugged uh and and uh where is it blm los angeles is that what it is no yeah here it is um so he got now look whether or not you think that he should have got jail time for it i personally think that you know 150 days that sucks that you have to. be in jail that long but dude. you wasted taxpayers i don't know. how much this [ __ ] cost it's it's illegal. you it should be illegal. to say that something happened like that. that's a crime that actually didn't happen. especially if you set it. up like that like he's a real [ __ ] for doing that. uh he's saying he didn't do. it i guess it would be different if he was like i [ __ ] up or whatever. but we all know about this. but black lives matter. posted we believe that first of all. it says free jesse small smolette. we believe that jesse is innocent. and you don't have to. believe in his innocence to. believe he should be free. okay fine that is a different. argument which i disagree with period. anyway but also you believe he's innocent. huh you think that this. is an injustice against against race. dude there's [ __ ] like evidence that he set it. up it's on camera. right like what are you doing. you jumped the shark. that's it so now what so. now i gotta [ __ ] support blm when you're saying free. justice milan and acting like that's the thing. dude you can't movements they [ __ ] eat themselves. dude dude here i am. wanting to support you i can't. [ __ ] support that dumb. [ __ ] and i'm [ __ ] dude don't push me man. you understand i'm a centrist you don't want. me oh two right. wings i'm trying to. remain level headed and here blm is oh jesse's innocent. nobody thinks he's innocent. you know why head did it. i just like it's like and then they think that [ __ ] other [ __ ] and not they i don't mean they blm just people think other [ __ ] they never get convicted or even there's not even a case. and they're like oh he did. it period [ __ ] him like uh uh [ __ ] what's his name goddammit what's his [ __ ] name never no game names and i'm not even [ __ ] with uh uh gabba pinton army hammer that's his [ __ ] name so he it's like i mean nobody'll work with jesse anymore. though right i have no [ __ ] idea but my point is look comments. on this post have been limited. even michael rappaport wrote haha and he's liberally [ __ ] um it's just so crazy dude. it's so crazy i guess army hammer. was in a movie though. right he was in a movie. that came out that tanked that's the other thing. too dude you know. that movie is gonna bomb. why do hollywood make these [ __ ] movies you know. they're gonna bomb the one. with wonder woman in it. and [ __ ] uh you you just see it it's like midnight train. to tokyo or whatever. [ __ ] it's called i don't know that's what it should be called judging on what the [ __ ] thing looks like but um it's just so it's like it's so crazy dude these movements jumped the shark. they just jumped the shark. you see this [ __ ] you look at the [ __ ] aziz ansari thing and it's like oh oh really dude it was a bad date and everything [ __ ] jumped it's like okay so these movements they get this people [ __ ] powers intoxicating dude it's intoxicating dude control it's intoxicating dude it is just so weird man it's such a weird [ __ ] thing but it ruins [ __ ] like blm is gonna stand for jesse smelly what's his [ __ ] name jesse smilette um and and like now it's like what about the actual racism in the world what about people who do [ __ ] [ __ ] people up what about what about this [ __ ] that's why you can't trust a [ __ ] movement. man [ __ ] these hashtags for real i don't know you mad at me for saying this but i i do whatever it's what i think i love you anyway i also [ __ ] fee you know who knows why he did this [ __ ] just jesse maybe his [ __ ] brain is broken who knows it's sad it's all sad it's all sad it's all [ __ ] sad i like how elon uh what do you call it oh wait let's actually this goes with it elon uh well no elon challenged uh putin to. a fight for ukraine. like like it's [ __ ] over the top. the movie like dude. you know i i don't i just it's like these [ __ ] that they they're just doing [ __ ] to. stay relevant you don't have to. elon elon you don't have to. this is the thing i don't get like you're not dj. khaled like dj khaled has to. do dumb [ __ ] to. stay relevant because you know. eventual rick ross same.
