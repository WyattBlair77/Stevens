connected is like new. york new york and you're like yeah that's cool. but i don't want i want to. go to the i want to. go to arya and they're like where's that. and they're like it's right. there they point to. it looks so close. and it is 19. miles away so that's cool. um so you gotta go outside you got to. put on sunblock and i'm not even a mr. sunblock i don't put on sunblock. if i don't have to. but you have to. there because the sun is close. the sun's like shaking hands. with you dude the sun's like uh it sounds. like your best friend and your worst. enemy just right there and um it's just uh it was so hot and i had to. man calvin's doing the thing we're just like pick. up pick up pick pick up pick up so i had to. walk them everywhere i had to. walk with them in on my shoulders. and we had absolutely awesome. sweat dripping down the the armpits. which is just absolutely fabulous. dude just keeping the sides. of my shirts completely wet. just absolutely damp and absolutely fabulous. just so great that it. was so damp from the sides. of my short shirt and then over into. the top of my shorts. just absolutely fabulous man. just having a swamp all over. my my outfit was just absolutely. great and i had the blue. palette going you know i had the blue. blue uh you know i had the blue. blue shorts and i you know i matched the socks. one day didn't mean to. but you know i guess it was subconscious. i was i was doing a blue. palette in las vegas. whatever oh so my [ __ ] you did it. again you know but um yeah he was having a palette even though. it was 114. oh so um but um yeah uh first day. went up a thousand five hundred dollars. next day went down back to. zero the next day lost three. grand the next day lost two. grand yes dude order. so he was in the whole five grand. but it was all good. because he also spent some money. uh and then so if you tack it on he had lost. even more money yes dude. also went to. see devin copperfield yes man. david copperfield man mr phoning it in huh. uh so anyway uh i'll talk more about that. later but it's just like uh you know las vegas. is too hot and it's all. good so i'll talk more about that. later but right now i want to. talk about i want to. talk about uh wanna talk about uh barbie. i'm pissed i'm pissed they say it. made 155 million dollars just in this. country i'm pissed they say i made over 300 million dollars. worldwide i'm pissed but what i will. say is it's gonna have a sharp drop off. next week and it's gonna absolutely 100. still bomb and everyone is like well. you can't say it bombed and i called. barbie i said i was gonna bomb. and i was right. dude and barbie is gonna bomb. and also here's what i realized about the barbie. it doesn't matter if it's gonna bomb. do you know why all mattel wants. to do is make toys that's all. they want to. do and they can do that. they can do that with ken. they can do that with barbie. and it's going to. make the toy sales. go up i am just so this. movie i am just not into. man and i'm not seeing it. and i will not see it. and i love ryan gosling. i think he's great i think he's a great. actor and i also think that margot robbie is a great. actor okay um and uh i don't know man. remember they're gonna they're gonna make the movie with uh what's her. what's her name the terrible. what's her name amy. schumer they were gonna make barbie. with her and then they were just like oh wait well what were we thinking. let's get actually the person who should be barbie. right uh that would have been absolutely awful. i wish they made it with amy. uh schumer would have been the worst. movie of all time you know. literally zero people would have gone. to see it would have been an empty house. uh uh amy schumer really. only can do movies where she does. this on the cover. of the poster and you can't. do that on barbie. you know just like this. oh god my life is sideways. look at me i try. to fit in but i can because of what. society says uh so yeah dude you know yeah do i have to. eat crow on the bomb. thing and the the here's the thing. dude oppenheimer helped it. and i'm gonna i'm gonna tell you because they branded it. together it was actually very smart. of them how did it do it. how did they do it. dude barbie was so set. up for fail and it's gonna it. is gonna dude um but it doesn't matter. because they're just trying to. sell sell sell toys oppenheimer i'm. still gonna see until i realized dude. here's the thing about these movies. man if you don't see them. opening weekend i don't [ __ ] want. to see him you know. and i don't want to. even go opening weekend but here's the thing. i get into the hype. i'm like cool i want. to see it i want. to see it so bad. i'm not going to. go opening weekend opening weekend happens. and then before you know. it i'm like ah wait till it. comes out at my house. on on apple tv or uh whatever. it is uh uh the rental. thing and then by the time. that happens i'm like hey i'll just watch a movie. about a killer crocodile. instead you know i don't care. that much i don't care that. much i know like do i really want to. sit and watch a movie where there's you know. we're three hours long about uh and it's only guys talking in in buildings. and [ __ ] you know that's what oppenheimer. is there's gonna be one one. scene where the bomb. happens and beside that it's gonna be guys talking and [ __ ] rooms so you know oppenheimer and barbie. they're doing great i think oppenheimer. is going to do. very very well i think barbie's. gonna have a sharp drop off. mission impossible had a sharp drop off. dude because it was because of the you know mission. impossible was that was gonna be the [ __ ] and then had a sharp drop off. and that's too bad because i love jeremy. renner but who knows man a lot. of people watching mission. impossible that's that's a good franchise. but tom cruise man. this is the thing man. you got to be i don't like these

okay. cool i'll watch kind of was excited. about it to. be honest also didn't have to. be in a 115 degree. heat then i googled david copperfield dude he's worth a billion. dollars hey he's worth he's a billionaire. it's hey how it's not real. it's not actually happening okay. but you know what i mean. like he's a magician it's all. fake we all know it. hey he's a billionaire. that's insane to. me what he is doing is bullshitting. and he's a billionaire. for that that's crazy i don't i think magicians are like i like justin willman is that. his name he's good because he's like doing. the [ __ ] and it's like kind of funny. and cute and [ __ ] like there are cool but the second it's like they're like like all right. buddy we know it's not happening. stop with the eyebrow [ __ ] there's one part where david garfield goes like this. at the end he just at the end. of a trick he literally goes like this. and i was like dude. cool it he goes one. time he went like this. and then went like this. twice dude like he was so mighty. duty 66 and it is eh. so phoning it in dude. it was unbelievable dude. he comes out like hey i'm deborah caulfield so i was born at the time. when i was born i had a dinosaur. little toy dinosaur and you know and rolled around with the dinosaur. i was in every picture he shows. pictures of him holding the dinosaur. when he's a little kid. and they're all photoshopped and in the me and immediately you're like oh these pictures are. real dude and i had one gold tooth and i thought and i always wanted to. happen and you're just like what's going. on dude and then he does. some tricks where you're like okay. i maybe see how he does it. but i don't know how he did. it really and then he pops a balloon. in another balloon and that is amazing. to pop a balloon. in another balloon is [ __ ] amazing. all right he just has a balloon. and another balloon stares. at it the balloon. in the inside pops the blue. one on the outside does. not pop now that was my favorite. trick did he make a ufo. appear out of nowhere. yes did he make a tyrannus rex. tyrannosaurus rex appear out of nowhere yes okay did he make a guy disappear in the crowd yes everyone thought that those were the best tricks dude no i only want the subtle [ __ ] because that's the [ __ ] i can't explain somehow dude he made a whole [ __ ] alien ship appear man he made a whole [ __ ] alien ship appear above us and everyone goes whoa and i'm like yeah but they probably have a propeller or drones and obviously came from the stage but dude popping a balloon inside another balloon do all that sort of [ __ ] all the time but yeah but this [ __ ] though where you're just like i'll never tell and it's like okay okay then you know then just do it you know then just don't tell us and just it's like but a billionaire all magicians should make ninety thousand dollars a year period. there that should be it should be like that's the cap. for the magician's league you cannot make more than 90. 000. how many of them. would still do it for the love. then huh i admire. david copperfield though i really do because man. he's 66. he married claudia schiffer first of all. who is like one. of the hottest babes of all. time and then uh you know. i get divorced obviously so is she like a 500. millionaire what dude i don't know. but this guy does he's 66. he did three shows on a saturday. so i was like well he must be loving. it and then i watched and uh phone it. in so i'm like why is he doing. it anyway um god bless dude. i love it david conference go i want. to meet him magicians

man. my dollar's all my hundred dollars. bills all caught in there. we gotta wait for them. to open it up they opened. it up and [ __ ] and so i'm sitting there with them and some dude i see as i'm walking over i see some dude. walk by me and let me just say something. you're not slick okay i know. when you know it notice me. all right it's like a hot. chick right they just walk into. the

beats with his hands. in his pockets and he's like this. and i stare back and i don't play. that [ __ ] okay i don't play that [ __ ] i stare back. until you speak i don't break gays. it's gonna be weird but it's gonna be more weird. for you all right [music]. the only way you can beat me. with that is if you're on drugs. and this guy was on some kind of drug. apparently because i stayed staring at him. while he was going. like this for god it. was nine seconds it was so uncomfortable. and then i finally go like this. hey what's up and he says so awesome. dude and i said oh yeah he said so

me that he got into. a school of acting that only 25. people got in and he was one. of them and i said oh well that's really cool. and he said yup. and next month i'm going to. an expo in dallas. you

like young. new actor i don't know then my buddy. sam was like buddy this guy over. here wants a picture and i was like oh yeah. come over and the guy wanted. the picture was like oh dude. i don't want to. interrupt you i said interrupt me you're [ __ ] saving. me so i took a picture of a bro. holy [ __ ] man vegas is so we're the only place. the only places where those types. of things happen are either. vegas or new york. in like the middle of the day. or if you're at a nightclub in la. that's it it doesn't happen. anywhere else period um and then we started gambling. i started going on craps or not. crap sorry i played roulette. a little bit first and this dude. was this handsome dude. who was like 54. just betting. thousands of dollars each roulette like i'm talking about there. was like there were like spins. that had 10 000 of his dollars. on the board and he was just like what. does it matter what does. it matter you know. what does it matter eh. what does it matter he kept saying. and i was like well yeah he's like it doesn't matter. you put this here you put this there it. doesn't matter he's telling me. and he starts telling me. jokes like jokes you'd read. from a book but here's what happened. he goes like this he puts. a five thousand dollar chip on. three okay he's got a one in 37. chance of turning this into. 180 000 okay or whatever. it is so he puts. it on three the things spinning right. before the dealer says no. more bets the dealer. or whatever you call. him because he's not dealing anything. really takes the chip and he says i don't think you. really want to. make that bet do you tosses. it off back to. the guy and then the [ __ ] ball lands on free okay so the guy says what the hell did you take that off for and the guy says well i didn't think you really wanted to. bet on it and he says but that's why. i'll put it there and he says nah. well it doesn't you know. it wasn't there so we can't pay you and the guy's like i put it on there. and then he says get the pit boss. because this guy's owed a hundred and eighty thousand. dollars the pit boss comes by. and is like what happened. here we explain and the pit. boss says no the maximum bet. here is 500 so that. bet is void anyway. you're getting nothing and then david sullivan. was there and he says nah. man i saw it. that's not fair he put that. chip there he should get that money. you should at least give him the 500. bet which is 18. grand okay and the pit boss. says this has got nothing to. do with you to. david sullivan and david sullivan. says yes it does. i was a witness and i was like that's actually pretty dope. he was witnessing it doesn't have something to. do so the pit boss. leaves to. make a call i don't. know what we call like jesus. christ or
