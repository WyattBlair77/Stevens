this. stuff anyway with the dice yes i've seen him. so uh actually you know what i know. i told you this but there's an addendum. to this story and i know you know this. i think i told it. in the lifeline group chat. all right i'll just tell it. yeah we don't know what. it is yet you do. once i start it right. now i don't know what it. is i know but everyone needs. to know okay i'm having a conversation. with kristen on the patio. of the coffee shop. block i used to. run that used to. be the coffee bean. and tea leaf and now it's an alfred's. coffee okay so it's better. but you think it's worse. it's worse right. it's better 99.9 of the population would say it's better. you are in the 0.1 percent that. would say it's worse. okay because i'm a genius. and so so we're we're having a conversation. kristen is looking at me and i'm looking to. her and i am facing the street. you know where this is going. i do i think i do yeah. yeah um a car pulls up. on the street and stops because it's at it's waiting. for a red light okay. i'm talking to. christian she's telling me something. important actually to where i i can. rack focus behind her and i see the window. is open in the passenger. seat and inside is somebody. staring at me and as iraq. focus i see it's bruce willis. okay question okay at this. point you say oh i didn't say that yet. in your mind uhhuh uh in you how much and how quickly. rather did you absolutely know. for sure instantaneously just immediately it. was immediately that was does. bruce was you know. why because he was looking directly at me i made eye. contact with him and he was he was actually. doing his bruce willis. smirk where he was like yeah. i can't do it but you know. i'm talking about he's being bruce he's being bruce willis. okay got it so i she's telling me. something important and actually emotional. okay oh no so i'm seeing now. i'm seeing bruce willis. oh god okay what a dilemma. yeah yeah so i'm like oh i don't know. what to do that's terrible. but and i actually think i need to. be here for her but but she'd want to. see bruce willis but you also also you got to. be there for bruce too. he's looking right at you. something's going on right. so i'm like now in my head. i'm like is bruce willis. famous enough to. where i should stop this and tell kristen. about it okay. and because if it was berry. pepper i would just tell her. later afterwards no offense to. berry pepper no we like we love you. giovanni ribisi i probably wouldn't do it. either no way anybody from favorite. ryan from brian besides matt. damon and tom hanks i don't. think i'd do it so so i'm like i gotta say something. and i say i'm sorry. babe but that's bruce willis. yeah he's one of the most giant movie. stars he's one of those giant. movie stars of all time. there's no doubt you have to. stop her and say yeah and i'm a huge fan. of you yeah you are yeah right. yeah so i say i'm sorry. i'm sorry babe but that's bruce willis. and she looks over okay. and bruce willis is. still staring directly at me. and how close are we talking to. him let's see uh how far would you say that. wall is over there 30. 30 40 feet okay so 35 yeah something like that 60 feet. twice oh that's close. though yeah it's very close yeah yeah okay so he's 60. feet away and then i i he's looking at me and i say that's bruce willis. i guess i say it. loud enough yeah which i really didn't try to. but a few of the people. around me go like this. so now yeah bruce will look at me. everybody's looking at bruce willis. okay on the patio. okay so now i'm like i have to. say something i guess. because i don't i don't know why. he's looking at me all. right and he's not looking away. at any point he's just staring no dude. he is not looking away. at any point he's just staring at me you're not weirded out. even a little bit very interested. in what is happening. what is going on here. yeah why is he staring at me. yeah did he just watch my netflix. special it's like this kind of thing. where i'm like did he just see a clip. of mine or something or or do. i look like a guy that like his ex. like this is always looking. at me right okay. so i say to. him allowed because now everybody's kind of involved. in a way and i want to. jump past the part of awkwardness. and i can do it like this. and i say hey man. we all love you. right and i say that. that loud because i want him. to know because i know he's also going. through that thing with with the brain. fog and all that he's doing well. yeah he's not doing so well but i gotta tell you something. he looks fantastic he looks he's bruce he looks. fantastic but you know you you know you sometimes. you see a guy after you haven't seen him. in a while and you're like oh they look. really old yeah he looks great. he looks great okay. so i say hey man. we all love you. and everyone's looking at him. and he leans out of the car. yeah and he goes like this. that much a lot okay. you told the story wrong dude. but first you build it. on text i know but tonight how could i how could i get this. through text there's no way just that part voice. noted yeah no but so you didn't do. enough o's i wanted to. do it on the podcast. all right then say that. i'm out and that's it. and then the guy who's driving. him that looks like akon by. the way is just like he's he's going. like this pointing at me. and bruce was like and there so he's literally just says no. words no words only woos that's and then later on i'm telling. the story rick recalling it to. kristen and someone else. and chris is like well he was looking. at me and i'm like oh dude. it's possible now it's not how do you know. i guess maybe because her back. was to him. right wow hey come here. and i was staring at him. from the beginning and end. she was here i was here. bruce was there so when she turned around. boom it looked like she was. looking back into the left. back and to. the left that looked like he was looking at her. obviously he was looking at me. because i said the thing and also took me in the beginning. so i get that okay. no the best part was. no who's that guy from the bear the actor jimmy. jeremy allen white yeah before. the bruce willis thing. i walked by that guy. and i was looking at him. as i was walking by. because when you're famous. and you see another famous. guy you gotta look at each other. and be like okay so i was walking. by and i went to. go look at him and he didn't look at me so i was like hey man. okay and then i went in and i got the bruce willis. thing uh maybe he didn't see. you though it was could have been but but i walked right. by him why and then so jokes on him. because i got the bruce willis. thing out yeah you you don't. even need him because you got the biggest movie i was like yeah. man that sucks you know the bear guy didn't kind of look at me and i was i was making sure. to i was ready. for the famous to. receive the famous oh we are both. in this together you. didn't even know his name. he's not on bruce willis's level. so yeah exactly and then and then i got the bruce willis. thing and then not only that bruce willis. was one that started it and he also did the woo. like for so long according to. you yeah was everyone else like what. is he doing no because the whole thing. was weird it was like they were like i can't believe we saw bruce willis. okay for me this is another. day in the office you know. but for everyone else i get it. wait but no i i want to. stick more with the crazy wooing. he did i don't know. why he did that did he really do it. for that long i might have been doing it. maybe i did two woo's. extra he did a lot of moves. that was fantastic is that part. of his thing well no i don't think it. well i here's the thing it. he did not in any way. seem out of it oh or incoherent or anything. like that he just seemed like he was having a fun. time maybe he was on drugs. i don't know i mean. i have no idea about any of that. but yeah so that's what happened. damn but kristen thinks it was for it. was for her and i you know it's just like okay. anyway that's my story all right yeah that's a pretty good. story yeah thanks yeah oh the addendum. i didn't even take the addendum. there's an addendum there's an addendum. i said that there. was gonna be an addendum. oh okay i thought that. was okay yeah dude i'm at a grocery. store today eating yeah and i i'm just eating i'm having a you. know i eat healthy i got caught. i'm eating cod it. doesn't matter the story but that doesn't matter yeah. eating at a grocery store. yeah that's what i'm doing. cod at a grocery store. dude dude are you 78. the eating cod at a grocery. store the 78 years old. you know i i don't feel i don't feel shame. about it at all. you shouldn't i'm just saying that's yeah. you're 78 okay keep going i'm with two. other people okay okay famous you're with them. yeah i'm with them they're famous. oh yeah okay so three famous. people that doesn't matter the story at all. i know i'm just a lot. of this matters i'm coloring it. like a novelist talks about the clouds. when they're really the books. about the guy dart. saying the parts that matter okay. i'm eating the cod yeah. that doesn't seem like it. matters but but i kind of and i'm doing it. and we're having a conversation rumor. willis walks by his daughter. who we know this is a willis. like for me just like a heavy. willis week to. willis fest is that the whole. story just weird right that's not weird. that's not weird really that's not weird. not really they're two different. people you know they're in the same. family dude yeah but they're not yeah yeah you don't think. it's weird if one day somebody sees matly at the next. day they say crystal yeah uh it's weird. there we go dude. it's a little weird yeah anyway. dude jokes on that. jimmy page allen. guy i wonder who you're gonna see you're gonna see demi tomorrow. or the other bruce willis. scout three i think he has four. they have four daughters together. i don't know lemonade is a popular. drink and it still is i get more. props since then bruce willis. okay shout out to. guru rest in peace. oh he's dead for a long. long time damn rips. man so anyway was the man. let's do it let's do it. so dark hi matt and chris. my fiance and i watch you. every week we love you. guys but my question is that we're getting. married in may and my stepdad. wants to have a fatherdaughter dance my real. dad probably not going. to be okay with that he's like typical hotheaded very emotional. italian father and i think he'd be hurt. if i had a dance just with my stepdad. i think it would like lessen the importance of the father. real fatherdaughter dance so you are gonna have a father but my stepdad was has been there since i was a kid he spent money on the wedding. and i want to. do something special for him. too but i don't want to. oneup the fatherdaughter dance so if you have any advice. on what i should do um or any ideas. on what to. say to either of them. that would be super chill. thank you so much. love you guys bye all right. here's the thing first of all a lot. of people say i don't know how to. i don't know how to. tell the person that that's a common. thing people call in to. show you yeah it is true. almost always the answer is how you just said it. yes yep yep it's like there's no how would you say. it on lifeline that's what you would yeah. that's the answer like you. would say it just the way. you did it was honest. it made sense it was it. was respectful of everyone's feelings you. don't need to. come up with this. whole way how do i do it. how do i do it. you just did it just do. it to a different. person that being said can't you just have the fatherdaughter. dance with your real dad. and then have like another nice thing. with your stepdad later that's what i'm. saying yeah like you have a whole you its own. thing don't have it compete. with your actual dad. have it be separate. everyone can be happy and if your real. dad gets upset about that. we've got an on our. hands well honestly but he he's an italian. guy he's a hotheaded italian. she said so he's out. also if this guy's paying for the wedding. like why isn't your dad. do it like come on the guy. came in every which way. yeah i know you're not dancing. with your stepdad right. yeah i know you'd never do. that to me right. yeah that's how it's gonna be and then later and then after that. it's gonna be like and now the dance. with the stepdad and you're gonna hear are. you kidding me from the back. for christ's sakes this guy's not gonna. pay and he's dictating who you can dance. with like no this. guy this guy come on you came. from my balls sweetheart and you're gonna dance. with somebody who's born come. from wow the speed. his speech yeah you know. i was gonna come up. here and give a really great. speech about my daughter and how great she was i remember times. we were playing light bright. on but i'll tell you something. man this disrespectful all right. first of all her second of all this. no nuts all right. she came from my balls. okay she came from my balls. all right i out in her. right there stand up. stand up i know we're not in good. terms stand up point that one. all right now this no nuts. you stand up you stand. up point your nuts you shouldn't come. from there you know where she came from. this pulls out his nuts. right there and she's gonna disrespect. her father me she's gonna disrespect. me let him come out of my nuts. i get a dance and then he also gets a dance so what do i get another. dance here we go. bandit come here daughter wow. this ball's still out. play what i want this. time cisco wow wow dude i don't think it'll go. that badly but just if it does. your real dad's dick. yeah you know a lot. of times people yeah it's true. yeah yeah um but yeah just have it. to do its own. your own separate thing with the other guy. yeah it's only right he's been with you. since you were a little kid. he paid for a wedding and you love him. this is 2023 not everything's all. cut and dry perfect. like it used to. be i mean all the things used to. be perfect but i mean like the family. unit it's sloppy it's messy. that's how it is though. so now i get another dance invent. your own go hits play. sinatra come on all the kids. are crying you know at the wedding. uh yeah make up more people do that. at weddings anyway don't do like the everyone's always done true. make it yours yeah. all this everyone's always yeah. the traditions they're not your traditions. you know me i don't believe in i don't. like traditions at all. make sure you're all having fun at your wedding. the everyone's enjoying themselves. that's it i went to. a wedding this past i guess. two weekends ago well three weekends ago. when this comes out. but um it was great.

the way. that's great hey boys. i need some advice here so uh. my coworker is like 45. and i'm 27. he's nice he's really really nice just get the feeling. that he needs a lot. of attention like grew up. military kid traveled around. a lot i don't know that. he had a lot of friends. because he just does not. seem socially aware and there's days that i have a lot of capacity. for it and i can shoot the and then there's days i just don't and i end. up kind of like ex. not exploding but snapping being like very rude. oh how do i handle it. man like it's legitimately. he's an older person but he'll come. in being like he'll ask you. questions that he's wanting you to. ask him the questions get a lot. of sleep and you're like yes. and he's like mine did and you're like oh here. we go now we're going. in this guy's fine. and i swear to. god dude the other day. he said blast as i like. upset he was like who the does that man. love you guys thank you. this guy's funny i like this. guy you're mad at the wrong. things here i don't i like blast. dude say whatever you want. no here's but but but here's the thing. you need to. develop a relationship with this guy. where it's okay for you. to be like why are you doing. this that's exactly right. and you can do it. in a humorous way it might be too late. now to do that but you can. also just do it in a boundaries actual way and be like hey which i don't i'm not i'm a big. fan on not you know just being making a joke. about it i got problems. so but but you can um you can do that. you should do it you're funny. though he should have done that already you're saying. he but what do you mean. the boundary you're saying he can say. look like i'm this and this and you're like hey man. you know i don't like when this happens. i like you but like why do you do. this you don't have to. do that like yeah you know. yeah god that's hard because you're telling somebody. what their like issues are kind of kind of i mean. try to do it. try to do it. like it makes me feel from that. track i agree though start just like you're obviously a funny. guy in a funny way. be like what the like why. do you do this like what. try that yeah just try it. it'll also help her i know you like you just want. to tell me about your weekend. so like go ahead what are you. doing yeah don't make me. answer first i know and you might be funny. dude you might feel weird. about it doing it. the first few times but also that. makes you funnier because you know. while you're doing it signal to. him that you are also having fun. with it here's the other thing. though you've got to. learn he's his boss. right uh no he's a coworker. okay you got then even just the same. you gotta you gotta coexist. with this person yeah so you they're your choice. so you don't want to. just like be irate all. the time like you are you. son of a why do you break. up my kids sleep. when you know i wanna. you gotta just learn. how to have fun with it. like lean into how ridiculous. the person is and have fun. collecting stories about him so you can talk about him. when he's not around walk. here's what you do next. time you see him say hey gotta ask you why. did you say blast is it. yeah yeah yeah is it. the 1940s yeah yeah he'll like that yeah he'll laugh at that i i hope he would if he didn't then that's crazy. yeah or you could be like dude. congratulations it's crazy but you look fantastic. for your age and he'll say. like really how old do you think i look. and then say 45 and then when he says i am 45. say that can't be you said blast. you're at least 90. so long to. get to the punch. down um yeah blast huh. that's pretty funny though the guy. that i'm gonna start saying black i like that. guy i'm gonna be 45 in a few. years though so i like that. guy but i look great. the coworker what but i look great. it's all right all right yeah breathe. in breathe out i had that. stick in my head because you said lean. in and now i'm thinking of that. great one of those things huh. i mean that could be it. could be a far it could be a thing. all right all right hey man. whoa cute sarah in autumn coming. to you from connecticut. um i am looking for advice. not for me but for my fiance. um i love him. dearly i want to. preface with that he goes. on uh paternity leave uh when mine ends and i work from home. okay and i need you to. give him advices on what he can do on his paternity. leave so he doesn't drive. me nuts and i say that. with all of the love um right. all of the advices you give funny. serious um we love you we watch the show. together so i hope he enjoys watching this. um can't wait to. see you come to. connecticut soon um matt. we love you as well. so does autumn um see you guys. soon thanks look at how cute. that baby babies are never that. cute yeah well no you know. what it is baby. you know what it is that. baby is so close. to birth that they're not usually. cute yet that's what i'm saying. yeah yeah but i'm saying you're way. better newborns i'm saying it. just like like scores better. wait what are you saying. i'm saying it like league's better. than you are no i'm saying babies. at that age are never cute. that baby's insanely cute. that's what you said now. but what you said then. which was what which was that. baby's really cute wow. and then i said it. leagues no you just didn't hear me. i said babies are never cute. yeah that's what you did. say but i'm saying it leaks better. being like oh baby's that. age or never that cute. you mean newborns. yeah yes which is a better. way to say it even. still close to birth. newborns are always ugly or look. like aliens i don't i don't. one or the other i don't agree. the ugly thing i think that the i think that it. is it's cute in that. sense that's a that's a personal. yeah it is a person. that's a taste though. yeah i'm saying like objectively they're like they do looking. things yes they they look. very well they look nonhuman. right well also think about it. though like they just went through. the most traumatic thing ever. yep their faces are red. women like bouncing around. birth for me but then in the in 2020. it was harder but yeah cool. man uh yeah so what about i'll tell you what i'd rather. be born again than go. through that show okay what i'm saying. but anyway yeah vice for autumn's. dad oh who's that almost died. dude how to. not drive his wife. crazy in the money well. i think it i think i think it. i think it falls a little bit more. on you i think you need to. set some sort of god i hate this. word but boundaries you need to. set some sort of this. is my work area this. is my work room this. is when i'm working when i'm working here. don't bother me unless it's an emergency right. don't just be like where are the diapers. you find them right. or whatever i don't know. what kind of relationship they have with the you. know if it's 50 50 or if it's like it sounds like a 50 50 if he's taking paternity leave but um yeah i think that it falls more on you to. be like yo this is my space. i gotta work from now to. now take care of this. don't come to. me unless somebody's bleeding okay there's that but there's also for him i would say the advice. is probably something like you're gonna not. know what to do because not. only are you off of work and you're usually at. work but you have all this. free time but you also have a newborn. baby and you have no experience. with those things and that's difficult. right and then you have your wife. who on top of that. just went through labor. and is recovering from that. and a lot of other going. on hormonally it's like it's crazy. time do the things that are expected. of you ask if you can do more whatever. those things are do them. and then once that's done. get the away because you're going. to be annoying if anyone ever you're going. to be that way. i would be out i'll tell you okay. and here's the other thing. she's asking the question wrong. she's saying how do i give my advice. no i know i know i'm giving advice. to him no i know. yeah but she's saying how do i give advice. to my how do you or i give advice. to uh like you us. or i her she gives advice. to my husband to. not drive me crazy. the advice should be how do i make sure. my husband doesn't drive me. crazy when he's home from paternity. leave but i'm telling you that. because that's much better. okay but she watches it with her. husband they're gonna watch it. he's gonna watch it. so she's calling for him. okay but she made very clear. what you weren't listening no no. i do know that but i'm just saying. hey dude she's about to. tell you something now then just now you look at him. and tell him what i just said. about you to hey this. is my workspace and i'll just do it. she has her own workspace and also figure it out. unless someone's bleeding wow so that was totally unnecessary which is all good. but uh yeah man just stay away. and stop don't annoy just in general. don't know someone who's just been through. something really really crazy. uh like birth no i don't. yeah for the mother. yeah yeah for the mother. also help just help. what's up chris and matt. i love the show let's get right. to it what do you say. or do to. someone who is chewing. works at the 76ers ridiculously. loud oh yeah that it. makes you want to. do violence on that. person it's tough uh got a coworker. i'm with him every now and then and uh i mean we're literally stuck in this. tiny van together one time's the. worst usually eating with. the clinch fist yeah. let me know what i can. do yeah that's tough dude. i'd eat outside of the van. i think honestly that's disgusting. you have to. say something yeah for sure you gotta say like because sometimes honestly okay so this. is this guy would love it. if in particularly that guy he's talking about saw this and wasn't didn't know he was going. to be seeing it and he'd just be like oh oh the chore yeah. yeah for sure yeah because you know. it's him because he knows he sits. there so i have done this. before i've i asked somebody once. who i was eating. around a lot yeah why they choose. the way that they chew. yeah because it always bothered the hell. out of me and it was like you know when you see somebody chewing. with their mouth full yeah you're like well. were you never a kid. yeah yeah when i was a kid. 20. because when i was a kid. if i ever made that mistake. for half of a chew. yeah some adult would have been there. and said don't you with your mouth. 100 and susie be like close. your mouth when you chew. right so if you skipped all that. like how did how did you you couldn't possibly. skip that so you must have not been a child. yep they weren't children. you were born at 20. same. to the guy yeah exactly. just so round about our advice. for this this episode you were born. at 20 what well because you couldn't have been a kid. right what are you talking. about so when you're a kid. and you're doing things that you aren't supposed. to be doing right. don't stop you i mean you chew. with your mouth this would be pretty. good way actually yeah yeah. yeah in all honesty that would be great. but um yeah like it's just it's it's it's this. anyway what i did i brought it. up and i said i don't remember exactly. how i said but it was rude. it's rude because when you confront somebody. like that sometimes there's no way. to not be rude. yeah my issue is that sometimes. i know that and i lean. into the rudeness because i'm like we both. know rude is coming right right. right and i like that you know. what i mean i appreciate it. yeah cool thanks you're the only one. and uh you know i'm like that. so what happened is the person. said back to. me an actual reason then i felt bad. yeah yep they they have something. that's something with their mouth. where like they to. actually close their mouth and chew. like cause them pain and so. then there i was literally shaming someone who kind of had like unbeknownst. to me like a disability with their mouth. you know yeah so maybe there's something. like that going on there's that. possibility but there's also the possibility. that you're dealing with a slob. who was never a child. and if that's the case. do what my brother just why. don't you just say this. are you a slobber do. you have a disability what if the after that the guy said am i chewing. yeah right it's happened dude. it happened before i you talking about my chewing. i um i have a friend that chews absolutely disgusting. no condition no no like that. or just like i honestly. i don't even want to. describe it because it's going to. make me feel disgusting. yeah okay okay fair yeah and i said ah you too. all up huh and he was like what. and i was like you're too up. it's gross don't do it. like that right because it's disgusting. okay nice and he was like i just chew. like this i don't know man. it tastes good and i was like yeah. but it's disgusting. for everyone right and i got another guy and i was like that's disgusting. right and he was like oh you chew. kind of with your food. up front and you know. it's disgusting yeah the whole. restaurant the hostess gonna buy you. dude people from other restaurants. you've been here but you've been to. mine before and it's disgusting. um but yeah and so i did do that. and uh and i remind him. whenever i see him he doesn't change every time no no if i'm eating i'm like ah yeah that's right. i forgot you two disgusting. the guy's married and like what you got. to change someone married. him i can't believe it. to be honest i can't. believe dude i would never be able. to marry someone who should discuss. it with their mouth open. good looking dude. great guy funny choose. disgusting that's tough man. yep close everyone listening. now pay attention to. how you chew if you happen. to chill with your mouth. open close it it's also not the regular mouth. open disgusting chew he does. he does a specific thing. i think i know i don't want to. hear it we owe it. to the audience he leaves. the food yeah in front of his yeah. i knew it dude. and and you can see when he chews it's in fr. it's in fr it's in like it's dip. like oh my god that guy. dude and and it's disgusting. anyway choose it you can see the strings. from up okay man. okay i'm just saying imagine i'm eating. tuna okay but i'm just i did. already okay and i don't want i don't know. why he does that dude. stop it who if he's listening now i'll tell him. i'll text him about it. does he know if he's listening now. does he know it's him. i'll text him right. now see what he says afterwards. i'm not gonna say who it. is though yeah so not not listening. this oh okay. um all right well it. takes a while i'll update. you all right you chew. up huh up huh. do i know this person just yeah. thinking about it i think i might know. do i maybe is it possible. that i know who it. is maybe okay all right. i'll see what he says all. right hey chris and matt. love the show i think it's a great thing. what you guys are doing. thanks i'm a long. time listener but this is my first submission. so cool dude we'll see how it goes anyways. i have this family member. who for the last six. years myself and others. have been encouraging him to. go to therapy and anyways. we're in this loophole. where he says he'll do. it to make us. feel better and then never does. it um and he really needs. it the last update we got he had. actually booked an appointment. which gave us some hope and then i texted him. the day of his appointment asking. him how it went. and he canceled it. because it was a remote session. and he didn't think he'd get anything out. of it now i've been to. therapy remote and in person. chris i know you've been to. therapy maybe you could share some words. of wisdom but i guess they advice. i'm looking for is. just what do i do. i know inperson therapy is really. hard to find right. now yeah wow and yeah what do. i do because he's he's very valuable to. me like he's a this. is a relationship that i don't want to. let go but he's not getting better. and i he's not pleasant. to be around and i just frankly. don't like being around. him anyways uh yeah dude. what do i how do you make somebody. do something that they don't. want to do yeah. well anyways uh thanks guys uh looking forward. to hear what you have. to say the answer is you cannot. yeah you can absolutely not. make someone suicide so that being said you've tried a number of ways. to get them to. go to therapy you think that'll make a difference if not even if it doesn't make a difference immediately. you know it would be a gesture signaling that he actually. wants to change and cares. with his friends and people close. to him think about him. but like dude you don't want to. be around him he doesn't want. to do the thing you're suggesting. i mean the solutions. right in front of you. man you you got to. stop hanging out with this guy also that's just how it is yeah. if people don't want to. change even though you've suggested a number. of ways that they could possibly. go about it and they don't even want to. try those things that might result. in them changing they're going. to come some who's never been. a therapy is going. to say oh no i don't think remote therapy. would work on me. that's crazy you don't know. anything dude like he's just going. to come up with some excuse. and he's going to. continue to. come up with those. excuses so do yourself a favor. and move on from. this dude this guy's not a good. friend you don't like him you don't like being around. him i think he says oh everyone. your friendship just because you have. been friends as a family. member it's not oh he didn't say. that because it's not his family. okay no but it's good. that you cut me off. four different times throughout the thing. i'm saying to make sure the wrong. thing you said something. that wasn't true but uh yeah. dude you don't oh i just hate i don't. like when people think yeah they like have you don't owe. this you don't need to. be this person's friend just because you have been this. person's friend if they're being a bad. friend then don't be their friend. it's a family member there shouldn't be such thing. as a bad friend because once you start. becoming a bad friend you're not a friend. anymore uh that's good i like that thank you that's almost as good as the saying. go ahead and call the cops. i'll have sex with them it's up. there um yeah you the other thing. you can do is try. and maybe you have tried this. but work the prescription. uh medic medicine um what angle. like you'd be like yo if you go to. this they could give you a prescription. to something that might actually help. you oh you could try. that angle be like that's how you can directly benefit from. it you know you think you won't benefit from it. from a zoom session. which is not true. it's very weird but also you know. they could prescribe. something to you that could absolutely. help you so unless it's just against medication. or the whole thing in which case. matt's right yeah dude. like i mean the guy. it sounds like you love. this dude and that breaks. my heart but like this is a family. member doesn't change the advice man. like if that person's not gonna take a single step. in a direction to improve. or address the things. that people around him who love him. are trying to. get him to address. then like he's not participating. in the friendship or uncle or son. or brother because it's a family. member but yeah but yeah no the same. does same is true of a family. member you don't oh your family. your time like you just you just you. keep people in your life. that are good for you. you keep people in your life. that you respect that respect. you back but you can't just keep someone in your life. just because you have been friends. with them up to. this point that's not a good reason. yeah that can count extra. yeah like if the friendship. is still there exactly but it. can't be the only thing yeah yeah when shit's hanging on by. thread yeah all right. yeah cool sounds good. next hey what up. man chris how you doing uh chris i saw you when you came to. sydney like i don't even know how long it. was like 20 years ago. by now please come back soon. you were hilarious um and matt. thank you you are so. funny on lifeline and i think you give amazing. advice thanks for everything. you guys do thanks. man my problem is with my girlfriend. i love her to. death but whenever we pick. a movie she refuses to. give good movies a chance you know. she would rather watch a shitty. netflix movie than watch. an actually decent movie. i mean i'm a big movie guy. i studied film i'm a big movie buff. i personally believe that all the best movies. in the world have already been made not to. say new movies can't be good right. but let's be honest. all the best movies. already exist sure so whenever i'm trying. to convince her to. watch you know your matrixes your fight. clubs size of lambs pulp fictions. whatever those kind of movies. she just won't do it. she she just doesn't want to. watch him she doesn't want to. take a chance on them. and i know she'll enjoy them. if she watches them but it's just yeah. i can never convince her. to just be like hey just give it a shot. i'm sure you'll like it. she would rather watch some yeah. shitty netflix movie that. came out oh you know what i mean. so it's like what can i say. to kind of convince her. to just take a chance. on a movie that i know. she's gonna like right yeah uh anyway yeah is it. actually won't sit through it. because he starts slow thanks. buddy or is it. that she just doesn't want to. yeah then like you just gotta talk. to her and be like hey can you just please try this. yeah yeah you you will like it but i feel like most. movies that are really great. they usually start pretty. slow because you i feel like well i don't know if that that's trying. to think of the movies. he's mentioning i don't think those they don't well fight. club is very boring i i don't like fight. club but beginning i think so but maybe people don't i guess yeah fiction. is and it has no probation. is but you know what dude. to somebody who's like into. tick tock and yeah. sure well there is a whole scene. it's like that scene is long. and you're like what is this. turn this off until everybody. it makes me mad that. someone would do that but they would 100. they would yeah i mean people turn off. in one minute so oh yeah. you know yeah um so have you heard of the millennial. pause you know about this do you know. about this chris what. is it the millennial pause. no so millennials are now. obviously like a little bit older. than like gen z. and right and i think i'm a millennial. technically i think you might be 1980. is the last year. yeah uh and so i definitely am yeah. and millennials do something where when they're taking a video of themselves. to post online they they. take like a beat or a breath. right after they hit record. so they'll hit they'll hit record. and then they'll go hey guys uh that little thing. is something that generation. z and zinnials say is like an annoying. thing millennials do because it's like just get to. the video whoa yeah dude really yeah if you look it up. and you'll pause and put it on the thing. yes i don't know if i don't know if anthony can because he kicked. it out he'll click on yeah. all maltese falcon right p. p a w s he writes. oh look there's even a wikipedia. thing he writes paws. sure or just go to. the wiki go to. the wikipedia page yeah. um the millennial is speaking. there's a pause in speaking. that is present at the start. of summer recording videos especially on short. film video app tick tock. the practice of including such a pause. is generally ascribe to. millennials a group often that's defined to. include people born in the 80s. and 90s the phenomenon is example. of the digital generation. gap between millennials and younger. generations taylor swift does. it that's funny that's funny. and she's obviously young but she's still a millennial. so like we're considered well. we including we yeah in we is taylor. swift which is insane. but we me you and taylor swift three of us. are all millennials yeah and we all probably do the millennial. polls and that makes younger people mad. because they have to. make sure that it's working. that's hilarious it's half. a second i know yeah. dude apparently does it make them mad. i was reading a whole. thing about it dude. like generous disease i'll just keep swiping. if they don't start right. away yeah if they're not. talking right away i'm not watching. it's like oh i'm sorry. i'm sorry is your time. so precious such an old guy. you know i'm sorry. you got a 14. you got a whole bunch of stuff. to do you got a whole lot. of videos the cares. what you got to. do in your ass life. i'm gonna pause for as long. as i want in the line. of fire and the tick tock. of fire dude in the line. of tick tock. uh why is i mean. how precious is your time. john malkovich relax who gives a they took a breath. taylor swift took a breath. before video line her up. shooter john markovic dude.

malkovich is. not john malkovich anymore. because he's too old. and now peter sarsgaard is john. he's a little i'll tell you why. he's a little more sensitive and the roles he's less. yeah it's less weird. more like less aggro explosive. you're right you're right peter sarsgard's amazing. though you think i love him. yeah i i wouldn't say otherwise. i just he's not in a lot. of that you know not. he's in a lot of weird. like random ship peter sarsgard the only person. no no you are kind of a little bit. time by john michael which i'm not mentioning him. at all we're only talking about peter.

before we get out. of here so it's curious. hey what's up matt and chris. got a question for chris. here yo man when you're training. working out i don't know. if you've ever measured your body parts. your legs your arms you know. to do you know. see how you've been growing. i've measured my arms and one arm is. like three quarters of an. inch smaller than the other arm is. okay what would you do. for that you just curl. more with the one. arm you just hope people don't notice. hit me up with that question. well people probably don't know my fiance. and i we're going to. be checking you out in ottawa. we actually bought tickets. hell yeah still gotta sell. it out though but we'll be there see you guys so dick. you know saying i can't sell it. off he's auto. was the one i'm not i've sold
