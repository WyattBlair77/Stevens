[ __ ] ya know what is the thing on the right i was just what i what what what. what is oh that's like a [ __ ] firing yes because i'm so confused. yeah got you magically is confuse. the whole thing is like i have guests. on unlike you i have actual guests. yeah and i have people on that. can like talk about [ __ ] that confuses me and clear. [ __ ] up for me. or [ __ ] that is like funny you're [ __ ] crazy right every guest like can kind of color. in something that sort of yells. me about the [ __ ] world and well and i don't want to. talk you know this isn't like a [ __ ] i don't it. sounds like i'm interviewing you. i'm not but i actually haven't asked you. this yet or even told it's a telling. you thing uh uh how come you're so good. at what you consciously. do do you consciously. okay so like take like i've heard maybe four episodes. now and over there 5 out. 5 they feel like yeah yeah yeah i think i've heard three or four. so how do you not mad. brother bad brother but yeah okay. no but that's a good brother. by the way i shouldn't listen. to all of them but yeah. okay well so i didn't yet. but that's a good brother. because i've listened to. [ __ ] most of them and i'm gonna listen to. all of them okay. so so by the way do you remember the [ __ ] thing when the guy was like oh yeah dude i think about that all the [ __ ] time yeah it was an infomercial i go back to. what i was gonna say. yes a compliment isn't it no. i don't so just be ready. for it i'm ready so there's a [ __ ] infomercial and we would watch infomercials. all the time and we and when we were like we do we live together. yeah yeah hold on before. you go we would watch infomercials. so [ __ ] much and so late and you were so [ __ ] annoying about making me do it yeah well because it is so fun for me. i no no i got it but i would do. it and i'd be like 3:00. a.m. i just feel like my eyes. would be so [ __ ] heavy yeah and you we would be pissing our pants. laughing but yeah yeah it would be me. you and like a lot of live. it like five guys yeah. i remember dave miller we lived. at five guys the burger. place and no we lived with five guys. with dave miller there was it was. chris paul mmm our other buddy. chris mock oh and then other guys. too i feel like i don't know. there's a role i don't know. whatever we were in our 20s. you looked out young. noble and no and and and we would just make fun. of informers and we but laugh. so hard it's one of my favorite. things because they the the one of the reasons. why i like inform us. of so much is because i know. everybody on it is absolutely. [ __ ] lying yeah they're better they know it and we know it and also everybody knows it everybody but everybody is watching this. like it's not [ __ ] yeah like they'll be like it is just the best product. and they know it's not because you see that. same guy selling that product selling. another product that's saying this. is the best product yeah so there. was one that was like i'm a get make money. get rich thing and he was like and i've made a lot. of money and we laughed so hard. because he whispered it for effect. and now we always say oh. yeah he was being such a [ __ ] prick yeah. he was being like i make money. right and like it's so much. i'm kinda like this yeah yeah yeah it was like when jay. z's rapping he's like yeah you know. and when he goes to. that for a fact he was like you know. to meet cassandra man. like that kind of [ __ ] he was like basically doing the jayz. of infomercials so anyway what i was gonna say yeah. about that about you mmm the the idi. amin of infomercials is you are really i don't. because i'm listening cuz cuz i'm selfcentered. i'm listening to. your podcast and i'm thinking how would i do. this mmmhmm yeah i i could not do. it and i'm surprised. you can do this because it's a it's great. to do this mmmhmm that. you can do it with some of the guests. you don't believe a word. they're [ __ ] so right rather you don't believe in a word they're saying yeah. it's not like you think they're lying. yeah right right yeah you don't you don't call. them out on it yeah and you don't even. really i know cuz i'm your brother. i can hear you be like okay. and i know you think they're crazy. yeah maybe yeah or whatever. but i i would be like the whole time. i would just be going. oh yeah you know what i mean. the whole time i'd be like well the crazy. thing about that is it's absolutely. not true or so now what. right but you don't do that. right i mean and and you don't do that. consciously that's the kind of the point. for me like the easiest. example is we had this famous. exorcist this dude bob larson. who by the way if you don't know who that is look. up his videos it's [ __ ] really is amazing. it's insane but he's like obviously to. be an extra you have to. believe in a lot of [ __ ] that like well i certainly don't believe in you know the thing is it's like i'm interested. in that guy right. so what i didn't what i don't want. to do with any guests. is be like will you believe that. that's donald for any judgment. on for first of all because i want to. know more and that's gonna close. him up but also like the whole thing. for me is like i don't i'm not. trying to like get you i'm not trying. like the nru and make you look. dumb and in doing that. they'll talk about way more [ __ ] like that episode. is called sexually transmitted demons. because he believes there's a thing called. sexually transmitted demons right we talked about that for like 10. or 15 minutes and you know. hit for sure but it's totally yeah iii but but i think it's very interesting. as well i i mean i would say i i think it's interesting. i mean i would watch those. videos on you too but i i guess. maybe it's why i'm a comedian. i can't i can't not make fun. of it yeah right. i mean i just can't yeah. like i would i i would laugh. you don't even really like laugh. like i would laugh i couldn't help. myself yeah i would laugh in their face. yeah and and and and i wouldn't but i wouldn't want. them but i also wouldn't want. them to feel stupid. right but so maybe that would make them feel stupid. i would want them to. like i love i love don't. get me wrong dude. i make fun of a lot. of [ __ ] on this podcast yeah and i would make fun of bob larson. on this faux fur yeah but i love that. there is a bob larson. and i love that. he's doing that and i would not. want to live in a world. where there isn't a bob larson. yeah that doesn't do that yeah. yeah so yeah i mean i just like like kind of what. you're saying i like that exists. yeah to me it's like. a show you know uhhuh. like if i if i if i thought too much. about it it would maybe like make me. [ __ ] cry or colin rowe. and think about how these people believe the ship. but it's really ultimately just so [ __ ] absurd. right that i like it. you know so do you think so bob. larson is this exorcist that. has been doing it for [ __ ] 50. 40 years he's been doing for 40. years he's done it. he says at least 40,000 yeah. yeah i heard that so and also which is that yeah. it's very it's very that but also do you think i always wonder. if guys like yeah he absolutely believes. in it oh dude. he this wasn't we don't even. have video of yep. we're gonna end up doing radio. soon but he with him. has a [ __ ] big cross and a bible. that he always has with him. i don't know if it's because like his some exorcist. [ __ ] there's gonna like crop up at any given moment but it's just like got it with them it was on the table between us it's like all of a sudden you're gonna be so bob larson i have a question give you some baloney so go give me the buy cars give me my cross exactly yeah so but that didn't happen he didn't have [ __ ] to. me i didn't have a demon. yeah but everyone well he says everyone. should get an exorcism whether you get it. or not which is a businessman yeah if you don't believe. he like he was to. make money anyway even though. he believes in he's like i can also make some money. yeah i mean you do the [ __ ] thing that's the thing i like about him. yeah just showman yeah yeah yeah i believe in this. ship but also gotta make a living right. right like i'm on his newsletter. and there was a thing he was trying. like a raise money yeah. like kidney stones like a thing like some operation. you needed to. do yes like god needs. you you know cuz i gotta keep doing. it you know that's like that. wow that's like the version of me. doing a [ __ ] corporate gig is a comedian. or something we're doing a wedding. i've never done a wedding but i've heard like i don't. know comedians do weddings and [ __ ] yeah yeah i somebody so tell me the other day. that jim jefferies like they were like he got hired. and him like a crazy. amount of money you know. these rich people and he's like alright i'll do it. but but it's weird. too because like when you when you as a comedian. like you'll get hard for these [ __ ] things that don't you don't know you're like they'll be like we we don't you know. we want that guy but they don't know. the act yeah they want like i've been hired. in a corporate gig in las vegas. for this i don't even company. but i was hired. because the the guy who ran the company. son was a big fan. now the guy was older the son. was probably 30something but the guy was like [ __ ] 60 in his 60s. and i'm like i don't know if this guy knows what. i talk about like right. this is his company's my son's come. right yeah so like a bunch of older. guys it went fine but you never know. you never know how that's gonna [ __ ] go there must be so [ __ ] they think they hire you and they think oh a comedian he's gonna be like paul reiser yeah you know and i'm not up there and i'm not up there talking about socks. right right you know how come you ever. miss match your socks and [ __ ] paul reiser yeah. yeah they're like you ever [ __ ] you ever. put the wrong thing with the wrong. thing in the car and then you know. the worst bit of [ __ ] fault. i'm paul reggie a oh okay. do you remember [ __ ] the sony hack. [ __ ] no oh yeah yeah of course i remember that yeah paul reiser's emails from that oh i'd never seen it never got about this or straight up the saddest [ __ ] nothing's ever yet it. he's like where's my money. from mad about you residuals no i've never seen. this before my like there. are a lot of dvds. in the world where's my money. and it's like it's 2016 dude. your show was on and really when he was talking about dvds. look 2014 yeah oh he wrote this. if your agent do it. yeah that's well see the problem. is when you get that. big like he was very big he knows. everybody and he has everybody seamon he's like i'm just gonna reach out. myself and do it the oldschool. way which is a horrible. idea so wait yeah okay. almost yeah this is this. is i never read. i never heard this i didn't remember. it being like a [ __ ] epic poem. this is like the longest. [ __ ] email ever well go out go out go up let's see a little bit of it. hope this finds you well. last time i saw you i think it. was in the lobby of the moscow. moscow hotel which was just nuts. you know it's gonna be sad. i was just going. to say that exact. sentence right that and you know. it's gonna be sad. because usually present parentheses. and and a [ __ ] and the exhibition trying to. make it like we're good we're good. yeah now here comes. the [ __ ] back door here comes this sad. and [ __ ] anyway i'm writing just to. tell you about the great. meeting i had yesterday with your people. that and here at the and you know. it's not that yeah not. sure if you even know about this. but i had been trying for the longest. time to try and get some clarity. as to why matt. about you was not available on it's entirely. entirety season six and seven were never released. on dvd at all itunes. offers only season three and seasons that by the fact that he even knows all that. don't even know it don't. even know it yeah you know very difficult. to find i had not even. known any of this until i started performing. on the road again. over the last two years. and people just have to. ask me why they couldn't get the season. okay so that's how i found out apparently. there was no more than a few. people out there who want these shows sure. there's a big big big show. and it was very fun. it was really as i remember yeah. anyway turns out music clearance. issues seem to. be the problem okay that's sure so yesterday. along with into my attorney and a longtime producer. okay i met with you okay. geez autism business [ __ ] they were terrifically helpful. and alright i told them. that my recollection comedic lead. distorted i'm sure yeah help us. get to show out there. so my hope is that you can once. again use your magic wand. and help us get the show. out there as i explained. to the group yesterday. my motivation here is not financial. though if we could i mean. yeah it is dude. yeah the truth is i just wanted. to rectify the crazymaking situation which we yeah. it's got to. be financial right uh yeah maybe he wants to. be i mean he thinks like it'll be like a friends. thing yeah but that's not gonna happen. yeah it's just to. make it available on itunes yeah. true yeah true very and latest hacker releases. one of the most depressing emails. you'll ever read from man. wondering why more people can. buy his ninety six home. yeah yeah i progress. i always liked paul reiser i always thought i was a fan. of his it's like always like from diner. and even mad about you i thought was [ __ ] hilarious. yeah i like paul ryan i think he's good. i haven't seen him in a bit. but a guys like that like i don't know. he was also a good actor his good. and [ __ ] yeah what's he like i don't know what he's doing. now i see him i see him. i know he was in that. movie whiplash oh it was yeah. yeah he plays miles teller. wasn't he in like [ __ ] alien and alien to. alien yeah like aliens. i was rad in [ __ ] alien yeah like he's like he just kind of made money and then [ __ ] bounced i feel like because he not enough though he needs the and mad about you citizen but he's probably got money i mean he's only 62. dude it's it's not like he's 70. [ __ ] eight you know you can still do a lot of [ __ ] it's not like you were like where's gene equity you're like always 90 become any like romance things he was yeah byebye love well honestly he was the marrying man yeah but a worst [ __ ] title there ever [ __ ] was the marrying man but honestly he i mean you know he really was really romantic but the that's the most paul reiser thing that could ever happen what what he's wearing yeah at least i know byebye love well by the way because also remember like dude this would even annoy me when i was 12 when they made a movie with the title of a [ __ ] popular song yeah yeah it would be like if i [ __ ] it would be like if i would start in a movie right now called ambitions. as a rider right. well i don't think people know that's a soupçon. as much but like like yesterday. when yesterday just came up. yeah but that's that's which is still different. cuz it's about the beatles. right but [ __ ] that though really oh yeah i don't think that i don't think [ __ ] that well cuz it's about the beatles. but the truth is [ __ ] that well no i mean [ __ ] that movie and its entire really you've seen it oh yeah oh really oh yeah why why is [ __ ] why [ __ ] it i think that sounds like a good idea i told you i had that idea right here's the thing okay not to. [ __ ] [ __ ] on you yeah you had the idea to. know well everyone in the [ __ ] world ever has had that idea what idea what exact. idea that idea about yesterday. the idea of like what if there. was a world where the [ __ ] this didn't exist. and the whole joke is jut. the whole movies just like that. joke over everyone's had that idea yeah man including you i thought about what if there was no i wanted. to make a movie about what. if there was no andrew dice clay. and way better yeah well i didn't see. yesterday but and a guy like was like found out. that that was a thing. and then he was injured. and he took his act mmhmm. and then he was like this. [ __ ] hack like hey you know and everyone's like well this is amazing yeah. yeah i really didn't think out. the idea that well but it's already. better than yesterday wow. yeah all right the thing.

don't know i don't remember i guess. we're done [ __ ] it no uhoh. oh i told you this. i wanted to this. chick came up to me. when i was at the [ __ ] coffee bean. i was killing now. i was drinking an iced. americano you know always doing that yeah yeah so but sometimes i get three shots over ice but at coffee. bean they kind of do a good iced. americano now here's the thing this girl came up to. me and she was like hey i'm a i'm such a big fan. i'm so nervous okay. but i'm such a big fan. and i just wanted to. tell you that and i said oh my god thank you. so much that's so sweet. of you she was very sweet. i was all smiles and i was like that's amazing. mmhmm and and she was like and she was like yeah. i actually ran into. you a a few months. ago and you even held the door. open for me and i always thought it. was so sweet so you're a really sweet. guy gentlemen yeah i was like. ah well you know what i was. like hey i guess you caught me. on a good day right. oh yeah so she says oh ho. i caught you on a good. okay you're like oh oh wow. cool walks away goes back to. her seat she's back. at her seat and i'm drinking. my iced americano. you know now it's half. half done i'm well i think i'm wait. for my buddy to get there. yeah yeah and and then i hear from over. my shoulder at her seat. i guess i caught you on. a good day oh she's like harping. on and i say and i turn around. and i say yeah her whatever. you know i don't know and she says you're an [ __ ] just like that yeah and i said what and she says i guess i caught you on a good. day i was like yeah you know like you know like i was just i don't. know i literally i'm i i pride myself. and kind of always at least saying something. that keeps the conversation going. bro i had no clue. what to say and i just kind of turned around. and went back to. my iced americano. and i was like jesus. christ did she stay like she sat. the whole time she was there. the whole time yeah she stayed she was. like 10 10 15 feet. away from me i pride myself. on like knowing what little mean. when they're [ __ ] in sin. yeah yeah i don't even. have a yeah i guess. on that one i don't know. either i don't know either there is a that's a funny story as it is. okay just because you know. i didn't add anything to. it just the fact that it. happened was funny right. there are few things that i didn't. say about that happening. make it a way. different story oh this is like some night. shyamalan ashram exactly yeah or at the end. was like i thought okay and guess what also there's no. harry potter in the world. over that so she said she had a really severe. like physical condition like she had. a a walker and she was like so so so this. is why you held the door. open now this yes and yes so i'm not that. much of a gentleman it. wasn't even that good of a day. it was just like you you can't. not open a door for. someone who maybe i don't remember i don't remember right. okay so she probably could have got out. herself didn't have to. do it no yes i didn't have to. do it but but maybe it seemed you don't. you dog you maybe it's nicer. that i did it i don't worry. right yeah maybe i play got up out. of my seat to. do it i don't know i'm not trying. to say i'm a good guy. but what i am saying. you're adding parts that you don't. even remember now you're right. ragging about being a nice guy. right aren't you even maybe true. yeah yeah yes so do you so i do that. made it more confusing. or less confusing i don't. know because i don't know i was like and this is now. this is why maybe i'm a bad. guy i'm like well does she just not know. because is is or does. this get me in trouble. but like it's also her mind affected. by this like is it not just a physical. sure yeah yeah so maybe maybe now i'm like maybe she doesn't know. the saying because of her she doesn't know. the saying but that could be regardless. of either way she's so [ __ ] demented till likes it. i did it when you texted me. because you told me. i didn't tell you the part. about the thing i didn't know the part. that there was a gap between you you. telling her that her being an [ __ ] a ver part. stories imagining her stewing about that. and like unable to. do semenya good things yeah. or innocuous so do you think that because of her physical. handicap that has nothing to. do with it that's the thing. i didn't know i think her physical handicap. has not has nothing to. do with it yeah i mean. i don't think it may. it may be does but my sense. is that look i'm always like my interactions with people. throughout the course of the day. i'm constantly thinking people are [ __ ] demented. yeah like well bob larson. demented people but even non exorcists right. [ __ ] demented you know i mean they'll figure out ways to. get offended yeah they'll figure out. ways to misconstrue right. what you're doing or just be really [ __ ] rude. for no reason at all and that's part. of the reason i wanted to. do my podcast is everything. coozes me about everything. everyone's always doing yeah that is a great. [ __ ] example yeah so you have her on the podcast yeah get her get her in so i also here's like the comedian. in me which is like so shitty. like the but i i didn't make this joke. but i thought about if i did make this joke. it would be shitty when she was came. up to me she was um. so nervous and i was like and this is such a bad. joke but i was like i was like [ __ ] and if the fact that even thought it made me feel bad but i was like i wonder if she wasn't as nervous if she would be shaking less dinner i'm saying yes i do know what just and that the fact that i thought that i felt awful yeah don't feel bad though yeah yeah because i actually thought because i actually thought i wonder because she was like oh my god i'm shaking she was like do it you liked you so much yeah and you saying caught me on a good day yeah made her go from being a supreme mega fan yeah calling you an [ __ ] yeah to. you yeah true yeah that's [ __ ] the biggest like a leap yeah to. go from loving you to. think it was just such a weird. [ __ ] thing because like i felt bad for her. i wanted her to be. okay hmm i wanted you know. well there's your problem right. there you shouldn't feel bad. for anybody anybody i don't think so you can feel it. but like you can't put it out. in the [ __ ] world you know i mean right well i wasn't like oh okay well you know right you know you did open a door for her though yeah you know i don't know man. i thought thing like i just like but the problem. is the problem is like then i started thinking. about like the world. we live in and like god forbid like i said. what i just said on twitter. yeah they'll be awful dry. yeah it wouldn't be funny. it's not funny that i thought that. you know i just but i'd but it but as a comedian. you think of all these bad jokes. and you sift them. out right and then the difference between like burying yourself on twitter and not is just literally typing the stuff. and putting it in the world. because everyone has those [ __ ] up thought oh yeah yeah you know yeah i mean if everyone was always saying what was coming into. their mind every single person. would be have to. be in like a mental. institution you know but isn't that but isn't. that but but that [ __ ] makes me lose. that's crazy to me which part. of it like that you can. just think a thought yeah that that. everyone's thought this [ __ ] yeah but if you write it on twitter you're you're [ __ ] done yeah you're done you're literally done we all think [ __ ] that if we wrote it on twitter we're [ __ ] done right especially it's like a [ __ ] celebrity sure done yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah we should just we should just say a bunch of those my family i think that yeah well no yeah no i think that it's i literally think that one day like the sony hack [ __ ] right everything's just gonna come out yeah you said that before yeah like you're gonna have the day where i wanted to. make a [ __ ] tv show about this. and i didn't i didn't ever pitch it but i wanted it. to be about like the day. that that happens everybody's [ __ ] email and texts and everything is just available because that day's gonna happen. yeah i agree yeah and and and then we're going to. live in a very different. world yeah because people like legitimately barack obama. yeah yeah are the keys. i mean there's no way. he hasn't texted like let me see her. today yeah and and guaranteed. barack obama has texted at. least once let me see your tip. of course yeah you know. yeah yeah yeah yeah i mean that's gonna have. to change everyone's judgment. of everyone out yeah. yeah for sure you know. looking up to like. oh let me see your titties. yeah [ __ ] now folks folks. let me see your titties. in an orgy with just. a [ __ ] button down and a tie and a blazer and no pants. it's not time to. take the whole [ __ ] thing off the [ __ ] obama so [ __ ] worst joke. even worse than the [ __ ] offcolor joke. that i didn't do right. i mean the things that you're talking. about the things that we think about in conversation. that just put into. our minds yeah oh they'll often. be like violent. for me mmm yeah like with you i'll be. like thinking about like ripping your throat. out that brother and it's alright but bad brother. but i don't do ever thought that. about you by the way. and it's all good okay. well now i feel bad yeah. even though i shouldn't but like but it's right. honestly honestly it's probably because you're my younger. brother and i'm your older. brother because you well let's not psychoanalyze no you know. because i feel like i there. is a part of me. where i feel like i would take care. of you no matter what oh that's because you're my younger. brother honestly you're making me. feel so [ __ ] bad and so i'll just like if you want one no no it's okay because you want to. kill me because that's a that's a [ __ ] things go forward. younger brothers happy yeah they want to. be the [ __ ] and i get it okay now chill out. though i would let you that's it. now how bad do you feel. definitely chill out. though but like even like just like if i'm like ordering. a [ __ ] bagel you know like like what if i just like i want to. like spit in this. person's face mmhmm you know. just a constant barrage of that. right barrage obama. barrage obama folks. i want to. spit in your face yeah why is he southern. when you do it folks. why is he on king of the hill. it's and i want to. spit in your face so um oh boy it's a hot. one anna i want. to put ting so i know that's mine. yeah that's acidic the guy. from pleased academy so. no that guy was around. yeah yeah by the way. let's just say right now there. was no one greater in the 80s. or 90s then whoever that guy was who did all the sounds in police academy. and that's it and we're not talking about it. yeah i mean please gotta miss so much. great [ __ ] you'll have to. do oh proctor i'm that [ __ ] dude i just made fun of this. last night on stage. i just [ __ ] talked about this last night. on stage the the the the the the mic. was buzzing when i was onstage. and it wouldn't stop and i got the guy i was like yo. can you fix this and they had to. literally bring a ladder. onstage to go up while i'm on stage to. go up and unplug a speaker so it would stop buzzing and when he got on the ladder. it kind of like felt back. a little bit and i was like a [ __ ] john candy movie like like i was like like you remember in the 80s. when they would like do [ __ ] and they wouldn't stop themselves. they'd be like whoa. keep holding on the ladder. you just let go oh and then i brought up. like the [ __ ] where you'd be like i have to. tell you something and he'd be like proctor not now. you know any like but i have to. and then you get hit in the head. with an anvil and i just said that. on [ __ ] stage last night. yeah those police academy movies. are the shh michael winslow. was the guy but yeah michael wins. though and he was the belle. of know michael wins. always together he would just go like no reason. character was yeah the [ __ ] lavelle larvell jones. yeah michael wins those guys [ __ ] rules. so hey by the way you know a white guy. wrote the script and [ __ ] named the character. larvell and that's racist so larvell. yeah carvel yeah i guess. or like larva okay. and then but then remember the [ __ ] david graf go back. go back you go too far. one fire yeah so too far. right now he's going too. far right he went to. flare that makes us mad. you don't win 24 to. fast so david graf eugene tackleberry. remember when he [ __ ] held the gun. to the shark and the shark. swam away tackleberry and hightower were like the badass. one yeah and then steve. guttenberg do it let me. just say that's right i'm gonna agree. to it steve guttenberg's face. yeah dude okay i was so ready. to agree i don't know you're gonna say. yeah i [ __ ] agree no steve. guttenberg's face steve guttenberg face yeah. looks like seaver looks like he's wearing a steve. guttenberg face dude look how rad. look at that [ __ ] no i'll do it steve. guttenberg the picture that you have with the [ __ ] purple. that's soso side behind it dude. that guy the devil. and steve guttenberg that is article i'd read. i prioritize reading that article over. almost anything you know steve. guttenberg gets so mad he blacks. out for twenty minutes it. wakes up and thinks oh god listen. what were we doing you know. what else thought well for real. his his dick. mmm hard is like three inches. you know yeah no his dick. is bigger limp than it. is hot yes it like goes you're like lands a little bit. like scientists would look at. it and the yeah what's going on. yeah they could be labor. the first of all take off that. mask and like it's not a mask. but steve guttenberg how much is steve. goldberg a guy that would get into. jiujitsu later you [ __ ] join a jiujitsu class and you'd be like oh my god steve greenberg zinn here's a [ __ ] brown belt while he's going through divorce while he's going through a divorce you're like heard it's good for your mind yes so a guy that would get into. jiujitsu late in life holy [ __ ] meters of him are there with his shirt off and [ __ ] why is he so [ __ ] yoked there's a video on youtube steve guttenberg shirtless he's got the raddest bottle that ever i do ready i knew that already every time he took off his shirt he was so [ __ ] shredded and also puffed it was unbelievable huh shredded it was because his face doesn't go with a shredded body doesn't but it does in the 80s and that's why yeah that's why he was so [ __ ] famous because like he was so 80s i mean do it he was great man what a rad guy does he ever not smile i don't think so like when he's sleeping he's he's got his teeth showing right i think his rad body i think so oh [ __ ] does it bogle jiu jitsu and steve guttenberg you know i might get lucky go to. google images he wasn't three men and a baby. which also rules yep. he did a lot of cool. [ __ ] talk about a guy that just couldn't be famous. now if he was that age. now like he would literally never get hired. yeah i know he liked you. that much i was a bit boring. regular looking a white guy. like yeah good [ __ ] [ __ ] that let me clue the [ __ ] is that yeah yeah john hines owner of him monkey bar jim dude no steve guttenberg for sure i can't i mean cuz i used to. do jiujitsu there would be guys that would be like [ __ ] in the class and he would just so be one of those guys and he would be good and it'd be so annoying and you'd be like hey i should be able to. kick his [ __ ] ass but it right he's also a really good chest hair. that guy yeah he does. he's also aged kind of well. he looks kind of good he just looks exactly. the same [ __ ] man what's he do there's ago him and polarize need to. do a movie about jiujitsu. yeah they could play like brother. will be the worst brother ultimate. that would be the worst. movie of all time if steve. guttenberg and [ __ ] what's his name and i paul reiser movie about jiujitsu. it late in life. i mean i would but the thing. is it would be bad but there's no way. i wouldn't watch the living [ __ ] [ __ ] out of it. look he was a short. circuit so much [ __ ] look at that. there's nothing more 80s. and go down then that image right. there of that then go down. look the classic trailer go. over yelling in wow dude. dude louisville you know vala bro. for no reason it will be like well we got to. get larvell on the case. and then he would just be like yeah and then they break. in the [ __ ] thing nobody do the air. that he'd walk through the airport. thing and he would do this. yeah yeah yeah i'm for no. reason even as a kid i was like dude. did he get the part. or did they write the thing. to find the perfect guy let me. tell you something i have thought about that. exact question yeah for like a grand. total probably of like 70. hours we can find that. out it's very easy to. find that out we just find out. one of the writers and [ __ ] and but they put they had to. have written it for like you know you know what i mean. like well maybe he got the part. they were like no no. no way there's no [ __ ] day day like i know that what the right. was like i also know this guy who could do sound effects. we could include that into. the thing right well maybe maybe he was already big. for being that gotta get the sound guy. he's probably like a comedian. ish kind of guy that would do like sounds like an impression. comedians and but uh i was gonna say. i was gonna say something. about that oh you know. what i laughed so hard. at in in in it was like police. academy 6 or one. of the best many hi. big baggage they were trying. to remake that movie actually [ __ ] years i also got you a box set of dvds. and you definitely never [ __ ] open. them and my brother yeah. oh yeah i remember you got me. yeah and you didn't open. but that was what will you polarizer. by me [ __ ] so so he so and then the big bad guy stole ice cream and then he went to. go eat it and it fell on the on. the concrete and he says oh crapola and i thought that. guy the jerk the juxtaposition of him. the oh this is it. is this the same oh my god. this is it let me. play it let me play. it what is it cry. you just literally googled crapola nah. man police academy six ice cream. oh really but it's called crap. ola oh it is yeah. crap all to. hold on oh my god here it's so high cause just. everything's on line i know always i thought was ever. so funny when i was eight. look look what is that larvell. no oh yeah oh oh so angry. about it you know. what of what i've done. that you know what's so [ __ ] bad about the scene. this is the one i'm already. to disagree no no no. no it's good to. be ready to. agree or dishonor i agree. with that okay but this is a mistake. this is not the script. okay this is a mistake. that happened during shooting and they should have. just done it again all right. what is it i don't know. if i agree dude the actors saw s a bad. yeah that he goes to. eat it yeah and then it kind of falls off. but he knows it's supposed. to fall off is it. on and then and then he waits for it. but he reacts too soon. watch [music] coming oh boy look good watch watch also just cut earlier. when it starts to. tip you know yeah just do it again just do it again also we tell you what i do like about that sequence though the closeup of the ice cream falling is is [ __ ] rad like that makes it to. me way better yeah so much. so that while it was happening. i was like great closeup yeah. yeah yeah yeah i'm low. maker i'm a filmmaker. i don't know that's what you say. that one of the my favorite. things about this is going. to look at the youtube. comments is always so funny. can't believe i found this whoever put this up. thank you still okay i remember this. oh it was that guy. but that that actor [ __ ] is rad. and in so much oh tall. guy really yeah yeah that's funny. that there's other people's favorite is. the internet here's the thing though. there is no scene that you can't. find if it's from a movie. you remember whether people remember it. and they it's online. dude hold on a second. though i was just about this. yeah that's so bad you're right. dude single boy so much. by the way he's saying old boy so much. because honestly he's such a badass. right right like like no reaction here is. a matter of fact. don't watch this mmhmm just listen. it couldn't sound more like a guy bust them. not too quick ha. ha yeah oh boy oh boy oh boy and then the splat and then the crap older just listen to. it don't don't watch my clothes. my [ __ ] okay okay i'm [ __ ] i'm ready listen [music] oh boy and that's him coming he came too early that woke up all that he came to. do the oh boy oh boy. is really i'm gonna come to. quickly yes and the laughing. he's so nervous he's so nervous. but also the amount he's out. of breath like that's exactly. aligned with its cause he's so big. and walking right right right. if you're that big just walking gets you straight. up yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah we all know. that we all know that. you know so oh sure okay wait so i'm laughing. you know i know i'm laughing. i laughed so much. dude do you have to. do it some people don't we'll have it. so i talked about this in the other markets. i just don't get some people just don't laugh. you know dude laugh more. everybody [ __ ] laughed more than that people don't want to. those areas in three. states so taken so seriously that's so upsetting. i know but whatever coppola you know. i know total crapola but also i wanted. to talk about kind of i guess. i wanted to talk about okay. well queuing on oh [ __ ] was another person you have on yeah i have an expert on this [ __ ] crazy conspiracy. theory you know what you should have on your podcast though okay this is suggest just a suggestion i mean. because here's why because it'll fall down. the microphone will fall. down so i'm putting the batman. cup on it to. profit so you've like a rigged. it i've rigged it okay. and when it falls i go crapola so no. you may get a different microphone. stand but for yeah yeah i know. i bro it's [ __ ] one fire yeah well so that's his name now the reason. so listen here's the deal. the queuing on you've had you had a q&q a nonexpert. yes not a researcher that knows everything. about to try to. quickly explain what qa9 is. for the closure don't know. why people don't know what the [ __ ] it is he went. on is it started. as like this anonymous person. posting on i think 4chan and now it's on hn this. person claiming to. be an military insider. head whoo yeah i mean. it's the most yeah sure i'll handle the hit okay. you do the hit and i'll just run. it everything that's hey i'll just [ __ ] you and it basically posits that it's this. person that's posting is names. cue it yeah you don't. have to do okay. look the i'm just going. with stop stopping mine okay you're stopping it. so i'll just do the hit you. are stopping me you're saying don't do the thing. i'm just gonna do what i'm gonna. do now but you okay. because here's the thing i have a podcast. just me and i have to. do the hits by myself. great thing is for you. to just talk and all handle it. i didn't [ __ ] do that i didn't do a single you're having all the okay alright so this [ __ ] person or people queue post. these things right they're like really really vague code. ish coded things that people are convinced. our clues about what they call. the coming storm and the coming storm is going. to lead to the great. awakening donald trump is going. to usher in this new era. of peace and prosperity and it's totally like a magath inge. okay you know and it's and it's and it's this. the the broader theory is that the millet. people certain people in the military. and donald trump are working together. to get rid of the deep. state clinton obama george soros the rothschilds. like anybody who anybody on the right. wing hates yeah and so. there's like this cabal. that controlling the world and trump. and these people in the military are like taking. them down yeah but every [ __ ] prediction this q entity has made is whoops. i know it's okay no you can do. it like this okay. it's like [ __ ] wrong right. right you're never ever right. everything this thing's always wrong. it's always [ __ ] wrong but then a hillary clinton being arrested. on october 18 2017 and obviously. wasn't right you know and there but then they they say [ __ ] like will cue the guy who leads it or whatever will be like yeah but disinformation is the thing exactly that on purpose right right yes insecure cell right right so it's always cool to. have a cabal that's super insecure. so um so so that so you had an expert on that. subject yeah on your podcast. that's very interesting i listened to. the whole thing you got let's do it. to clarify like what's up. righties how do you believe right. right this right now. my suggestion is you have to. get somebody who is an absolute member. of the killa not on. your right podcast for sure. you have to. yeah because that's i have to. know how that person really actually. believed it in thinks that yeah. i'm going to for sure. so one thing we want to. do is like we'll have someone who's like an expert. on a thing and then who after that. either a week or a couple. weeks after that we'll have like someone who is an actual person. among that thing like like they're the in cell. culture is like we're i talked to. somebody about in so quran what the [ __ ] that is right. well spawn from i'm also going. to talk to. an actual in cell. you're gonna yeah you plan on. doing this yeah yeah yeah that's great. okay good good hell yeah. the install thing is like oh yeah it's it's yeah that's a pretty wild thing. we've talked about that here. yeah butters isn't in cell. well that's unfortunate yeah my dog. is an insult yeah he's your father. he's a father but he's busted but he's used. to london itself. did he bust in it. in in another dog he did. yeah well then he's not a [ __ ] insult. well he yeah but dogs. are you frosted if you're a doll. no and you've busted in another dog. i know but you're not an answer. i know that but one. fire ruined it by exposing. that butters as a father. he said that and it upset. me too and the truth. is i didn't even know why. it upset me because what i was like what he's saying is you're gonna it's bad yeah you're intuitive yeah yeah coppola oh crapola so i thought that was so funny. when i was [ __ ] nine or whatever killed boy oh boy city. honest say that every time i come now yeah oh boy oh boy. oh boy and then say crap. old after i do yeah. that's a good idea i think so when did. it come out city under siege oh is that the like the actual title. like police academy academy. city under siege wow pace. academy saw drunk the way. set up piece academy 1989. so i was not i was nein nein nein 1989 i was i was nine. i was drunk i was nine so there. we go i [ __ ] said it and i knew it. that's [ __ ] amazing you call this buddy well the thing was i was like you know how i thought i maybe i was nine it. was like what at what point. in my life would i think that crapola is funny. and i was like nine i honestly. i would laugh at that. now yeah i would too but for a different. [ __ ] rhea okay yeah yeah yeah do i love [ __ ] from like the late 80s. and early 90s like tv. movies i know me today i think it's because you i think it's because probably we grew up. then i think oh yeah for sure. like when like like drake came out. with a [ __ ] this is hilarious. but drake yesterday or two. days ago came out with like a [ __ ] or a week ago i don't know when this is gonna air but came out with a greatest hits album. and it's like well you don't have to. do that anymore because of [ __ ] spotify yes totally so but he did and people are like wow it's bringing me back and they love the music extra because they grew up with it in 2012 now they're all [ __ ] twenty right but like you love it extra because you grew up with it right right and that's what crapple is but also looking back like an early 90s. movie they will be like a guy being like like a really like attractive. woman and it'll be like you got to. lose some weight i don't want to. be married to. a whale yeah yeah you know and like the context. isn't like what a piece. of [ __ ] right it's just like a scene right and you're just like oh my god the world is different. you know i mean the world. certainly is different yeah it's like calling your wife. a whale with like a smile. yeah it was like chilling. back then yeah and i mean. i stopped doing that i had to. stop yeah well once you know. i had to stop calling my. wife your wife well yeah. so yeah remember this. though i wanted to. talk because we love this. video i think i know what's coming yeah. this is gonna live it quentin tarantino's. on camera man [ __ ] goddamn. how much does he okay. yeah how much does. he deeply regret and his like after he does. it it's like oh no okay. i gotta brush it okay i forget. it i haven't seen so much. what's going on here. nose my nose is going. on here yeah yeah what's going on. here what are you doing. what are you doing here. not to talk to. me what are you doing. don't do that again. i am fat rules. actually go how'd he get so far. understand how he gets so far i'm sorry. yeah are you oh yeah so your ass. up and down this yeah. you know what these greatest film. couldn't turn guys ever made. i'm sorry he's the [ __ ] like she just is the [ __ ] dude like just that he's wearing that is already like you're the [ __ ] let me tell you something man i agree with everything. that happened here where's it. going i don't know where did he come. from was definitely in utah. yeah but also like where is he going. look how did it get the finger. placement yeah what's going on here. know what's going on here like he's [ __ ] addition yeah a magician no he this is i'm happy. that he slapped him i don't i don't think he's sad to. my thing he slapped. the camera yeah okay i'm happy. he did that he shouldn't. slap the guy's face obviously but you guys. shouldn't just be in his face. and of course of course right. i think that if a guy is in your face. filming you yeah it is it should be a rule it. is okay to. slap the camera out of the person. it is you're right american. right to slap that. out of you you shouldn't ever physically. assault someone but i think it's okay if a guy has a camera on somebody's face on you know what's the word know what unsolicited yeah if it's like yeah exactly and you're just you have it it's oak you basically have signed. this contract uh it's okay for me. to get smacked at it. it's like they've broken the contract. like people are constantly not knowing the rules. and if you don't know. the rules and you break. the rule like yeah all bets. are off too right. i'm gonna slap that. [ __ ] out of your [ __ ] right right right and i hope it break. right now also but in the video. how does the person. get so [ __ ] far away. but quinton gets far but he he slaps. him and then suddenly there's like a football field. between is there a cut no there's not. a cut right i mean. unless they cut it afterwards. it's unbeliev you after watches. it expect tarantino stops the cameraman. if you're watching the video pocket. you can see it but he slaps. the camera out of the hit and it's like it's like he's the flash. all of a sudden he's [ __ ] 20. feet away yes yeah it's really weird. yeah oh it makes it way. funnier and then and then it man. and when he does that. thing it's how i nobody look if you're here i also that's a [ __ ] good impression thank you why the [ __ ] like yeah now you know what i'm doing that's so good i actually disagree with you that he feels bad feels bad he's like nervous cuz it's on camera he slapped somebody i disagree with that too i what about after and you know i think what you're doing is coiling up. as a snake and and i might have to. do something else here oh i think he's like man. right i'm acting like cool i'm gonna lure. him in and i'm gonna [ __ ] cuz i might i might fight this guy i think that's what he's doing i don't think that what you're saying is right. play the tape again i appreciate you. saying that what's going on here. put that down what's going. on here what do you. know good what are you doing. gigi can you not talk to. me what are you doing. now he's a camera phone. how is it that far. away he's so far you must ran what sorrell hates. me this is [ __ ] you wanna hit me yeah [ __ ] yeah but by the way that should be in a court of law is like well you said hit him yeah yeah yeah i agree with that too yeah that's a [ __ ] [ __ ] thing so here we go snakes so much tougher because that's what the snake does it's like okay look just come by i'm just part of the bush that's what's do it i'm just parted by squirrel but that's what he's already hit him i know i understand but it was like a love it was like a [ __ ] smack out of the thing i'm gonna choke the [ __ ] out of him and that's all good like luring him in a hundred percent disagree but i like yours better. so let's just go is you know. why i know he's coiling. no i don't because he sipped his coffee. there is no [ __ ] way this is good but he would sip his coffee. at this moment unless he was like look i'm just gonna act natural everything. so i i agree with that. it's a high tension. it's a i agree with that. what i think is he's like i don't want. this guy to. like report yeah and he's like no. you know it's all fine. i'm so chill yeah. i'm actually just gonna sip i'm not even. gonna punch i'm not gonna yack. i'm gonna sip and like now we could be we could be like yeah. no i i but you know. quentin tarantino you know how he thinks about things. yeah you know he hates this. guy and and in he thinks there's he thinks basically like i should be able. to beat the [ __ ] out of this guy yeah he should i should beat this guy he should yeah and i saw i think that i think that my way is right it's also way funnier well here's the thing whether you're right or not yeah i like yeah it's a better that yeah so i believe that matt's like anything that can be better it's not true that's the thing without less it again is now it's not sinking someone is amazing. exhale i'm starting yeah are you oh you so you're not just a guy. from russia paparazzi guy always going. like this extra yeah. yeah he's selling it this. is the wwe yeah he definitely is. into that [ __ ] yeah yeah you filming yeah but that was up. i'd be whooping your ass up and down this right. here there's the raddest [ __ ] thing anyone's ever. done to say that. to get clarification and then be like oh right. because if that were true. i'd be whoopin your ass. up and down the street. and then to turn around. walk away from a starbucks up. with street with that puffy raccoon do. jacket i'll get the where i pause. where i paused it look. i have a wild animal. see dude dude he yeah yeah because if that were off if that cameras i was off i'd be whipping it whooping your ass up and down this [ __ ] [ __ ] that is a soda water. he's a great writer just gonna say that. yeah she's already to. say it i've been in this. situation in my head 90 15. minutes right right right. yeah so i said the coffee. deletes a copy oh dude. block god yeah he's [ __ ] funny i'll [ __ ] love tarantino do it he was at the comedy store once yeah and i [ __ ] ate [ __ ] oh really yeah it was so long ago i was like i want to. go out for a quinn 32. maybe he'll put me in the next. one just so longer than i ate.
