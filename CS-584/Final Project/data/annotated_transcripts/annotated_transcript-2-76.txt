[ __ ] hot [ __ ] they wanted hot [ __ ] i give him hot [ __ ] you know priced up my tickets a little bit babies so i had to. give him the hot [ __ ] and i do do it but he also gets really vulnerable and gets [ __ ] real right because he has to. because he does because that's good for him. and it's just it's just [ __ ] nice you know. you you know it's like i go. in and i know how to. [ __ ] make people laugh but also i want to. [ __ ] you know sometimes i just want to. sit on the stool and guess what it's story time. yeah dude talk about my inner demons. talk about the [ __ ] walls down but uh so come on out. and see a show dude. the don't push me tour. is absolutely bonkers we're having such a good. time check out the vlogs over. on the channel the kristalia. channel we are putting the san uh the san diego. one up soon uh so you could check it. out uh but we've been having a really good time. god my voice is great. it's got a lot of soda. in it right now you know why. because i haven't been doing stand. up for two months so i did. three shows and after the first two shows. on the saturday my voice. was gone dude and i started selling center. really nice dude because i'm talking. really nice i'm talking like viggo. mortensen in history of violence. nice like i had a real soda. in my voice like i'm not sam. elliott but i'm vigo mortensen in. [ __ ] the history of violence. right like just kind of gravely. just like someone just kicked rocks. up into my mouth. and they bounced off. my palate and just went down. my esophagus and then they just started kind of speaking. and people were like whoa. whoa whoa whoa it's really it's gonna be that. sexy and i'm just like guess. so guess so i got no control. over my own voice i mean. i can make it do things. but when i'm just relaxed and just chilling. this is what it is you're welcome. for the refreshing drink there's soda. in my voice um so yeah so that's what happens. when you do three shows. after not doing them. for two months you start. sounding a little bit too. much cool and uh so i am. sounding a little bit too. much cool and uh you know. what i mean ladies i'm sorry. for the wetness i i i basically um should hand. out towels at my shows it's fine. dude i um i thought i was gonna [ __ ] it up i thought i was gonna [ __ ] up my show because i haven't done it for two months and i've never not performed for that long except for when i was starting from scratch. after that like in 2020. took a break for a year. and then i started from scratch. but i had an act that was i already was doing. and then stopped for two months. and then had to. basically do the the the um show. that i was doing already. and i didn't think about it. when i was not working. for two months once didn't think about it. once also it's crazy. when you're gone and just immersed in like a therapeutic environment the [ __ ] that you don't think about once. dude i was there and i would be like you know. when you let you know. when you're in high school. and you leave high school. and you're like man these guys. i'll probably know a lot of these guys. for a long time and then [ __ ] nine years later. you're like oh yeah chris. benino what the [ __ ] ever happened to. that guy totally forgot about. him that's what it's like when you're there. in a therapeutic environment for for. over a month you just don't think about people. like some of your best friends. and it's like really like okay. but also also is it. are they important in your life. so then you're going through. this thing and we're just like well. but yeah they are but maybe you're just you know. dealing with your own [ __ ] and that's fine. dude you get to. take breaks from friendships i fully believe that. you get to take breaks. from friendships um i don't even really i haven't honestly. i haven't been wanting to. hang out with anyone lately. and that's weird for me. man i love weirdos and i love [ __ ] being you know hanging with people that just i got no business hanging out with just like weirdos like uh people that you know my wife or or somebody might be like who is that guy and i'm just like that's my buddy. troy and he's just like some troglodyte. wearing a [ __ ] uh vince carter. jersey you know with hair. on his [ __ ] shoulders dude vince carter. jerseys vince caught a bomb. harder who says that jayz. vince carter okay um dude. that is the most insecure laugh. and we all know it. and it's all good and jayz. knows it and i know he's probably heard. about this because this podcast. is world renowned dude. um i will not accept. that this podcast is not the best. podcast going and i know that everybody. understands that everyone has their own. opinion but when it comes to. the hardhitting facts like when like people in san diego. say classic and everyone has something to. do with the [ __ ] military or navy and all the chicks have tattoos you come to. me and also i got a little bit of a sweet. vulnerable side right. so you really you know. that's fine but comment below. and just hook up. the algorithm right hook up. the algorithm right um so yeah we're having a good time. in life and uh you know. last episode was a little bit of a doozy. i was talking about how i was in rehab. and we got a little bit emotional. and you know i'm trying. to [ __ ] keep the silly. goose times but i gotta be real. don't i babies oh he's gotta be real dude. he's gotta be real why. because he he's got no. choice but to. [ __ ] let them walls down and be real oh god dude is he real uh was he was he real no was he real occasionally but is he real now oh god he's so real now and dude uh i can't help it great um if you're new listener thank you very much if you're not a new listener you listen before send this to. your friend uh we're hooking it. up we got the new merch. at uh chrisley dot com. we're going over and do some fall colors dude. um so yeah i was in san diego. what did i do in san diego. drove down to. san diego you got to. drive down is san diego on saturday. it takes two hours. you drive down to. san diego from la on. a friday or a thursday. 11 hours the traffic is absolutely it's just so shitty. man it's just so [ __ ] shitty you know and i try not to. look at my phone when i'm driving. because that's unsafe but it's also what. are we doing here traffic. you're being boring as [ __ ] so it's like i don't watch forensic files. on my phone but i want to. right so traffic let's keep i want. cars to be all locked into. a grid i also think that cars. should i'm like i have some nice. cars but i think that cars. should legitimately be just um i don't think people. should have their own cars. i think you should just go. when you're done at a place. find a car like i think cars. should be government like just like put out there. by the actual state and you just go. and you just don't need key. as you go and you drive. home and then when you're home you take a car and then you drive. to work and when you're at work. if somebody took your car you just go. get another car in the parking. lot everyone would have to. have gates in their homes though. you know because then people would probably steal. cars out of your home and there's probably too many. homeless people that would be stealing cars. never mind scratch that. but in theory it's good and i'm a communist. so i think that that [ __ ] you know i think that that's great. i think that everyone should have. the most equal amount of money. dude i think that it. should be about uh what do you call. it um what do you call. it um it should be like russia. are they communists i don't know but we come. here to learn. we don't come here to. learn we come here to. talk about the hardhitting issues. like pants um so yeah what's going on over i haven't heard about russia. in a long time. they still fighting the media. will do some [ __ ] they'll be hanging out having a good time. talking about some [ __ ] and then they'll just like be like all right. dude we'll get back to. you on like some real big [ __ ] happens but they're still fighting. over there that's the thing about war. i'll tell you right now. foreign here's a [ __ ] hot take war takes too long it. takes too long do it. better and way quicker war is. like when i have to. go to target with. my wife and you know. because she's like let's go i think i'm gonna make you the executive. decision that you're going to. come and we're all going to. go as a family and i'm like all right. you know i'm like the [ __ ] secretary of state or whatever. like i guess if that's really what you want. to do mrs. president my damn president and then we go to. the [ __ ] um i'm like the donald rumsfeld or whatever no he's the [ __ ] who gives a [ __ ] i don't know. but like i don't know much. about the government but you know what i mean. i'm trying to paint a picture. and then we go and then i'm just like she's like looking at dresses and [ __ ] and it's like this. is target you look. at pots and pans. and maybe like a [ __ ] nose hair clipper but she's like look at this. cute little pumpkin thing. with the straw on. it we should get it. for halloween and i'm like it's august. 5th but i love it. right she's my angel and i want her to. be happy
