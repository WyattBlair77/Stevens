wake up and you just kind of are. like oh maybe i'll get up. you know what i mean. sometimes you wake up and you're like is it. time to get up. or i'm not going to. open my eyes yet i'm just going. to chill and kind of like ease. into the wake up. it's like it's like the calisthetics or the [ __ ] no the warmup of the wake up. where you're just like am. i awake yet sometimes you. do that and sometimes you do what. i did you wake up. in the middle of a dream. and it's not just waking up. in the middle of the dream. the dream is hectic and violent. and way deep a few level. into the matrix and you do this. okay that was the first. sound i heard when i woke up and oops. it was coming from me. i go now kristen unbeknownst to. me is already awake and she laughs and she says oh my god honey are. you okay and i li start. laughing because i know why i made that sound and you don't. and she didn't at this. point so now i go from groggy. and i'm still groggy but all along. the way i also am excited. to tell her why i woke. up because it was quite. possibly the funniest moment that. has happened to me. all year okay this is why. i woke up making that noise. i was in a dream. but i didn't know i was in a dream. i thought it was real life. and i was in the lobby. of the waiting room which doesn't exist. for a movie that we were shooting and a lobby. where you're waiting to. shoot doesn't exist when you're doing. a movie you're just kind of waiting. around you're either at craft service or in your trailer. but there was a lobby. it had like an elevator in it. and a receptionist and [ __ ] and we were all waiting to. shoot a movie our parts there. was already an actor in there. shooting his part and in the waiting. room there was me and hugh jackman. and hugh jackman. was dressed like a knight. okay he was in knight. armor knights armor but it was also like some samurai japanese. style kind of [ __ ] [ __ ] you know what i'm talking about like the last samurai but like [ __ ] but he was. hugh jackman not tom cruz. so there was a famous actor shooting me and then also hugh jackman. i don't remember who the famous. actor was as soon as i woke. up i forgot who it. was right but i'm in the middle. of this dream and i'm dreaming. now this is about 35. seconds before i wake up. going okay so i say so i'm with you. jackman and the first actor is done. doing it done doing the the part. right he he comes in and then it's hugh jackman. hugh jackman says i guess. it's my turn now you know. he's australian and [ __ ] even though. it doesn't seem like he would be and i said cool. so he goes and he shoots. his part and then the dream. kind of fast forwards and hugh jackman's. done and he comes back. out and he says how's it going. and i said hey man. how was it and he said ah good man. it went great and i said ah [ __ ] great. man come on dude. really he said yeah it went. really well and i said oh come on literally. in the dream i said oh come. on hugh blackman okay i say you're [ __ ] like this huge action movie star and it sucks. like i'm like this guy and now it's my turn and i got to. follow what you did it. sucks and he says i it'll be all right. and i was like no it's not going. to be all right i'm going. to look so bad. and he goes like this. ah don't worry about it. he starts walking in the other room. and i'm following him and i'm doing this. thing where like i'm pretending. to be upset. more upset than i am and he clocks it he knows and he's going along. with the bit so now i'm in this. dream and i got huge jackman. doing bits with me and we both. know about it it's not like i can't. read the room i'm reading. the room hugh jackman's in the room. and he gets my bit and he's in [ __ ] night/ japanese. armor gear and i don't. even know this is a dream so i'm like this. rocks okay hugh jackman. is like all right mate. whatever playing the part of the [ __ ] bit where he's like all right. mate it's going to. be fun going to. do all right walks into. the other room and he walks through. a doorway and in his night/. japanese samurai outfit he goes. to punch a wall okay. like as a joke. he's like a might you be fine. right he goes to. punch a wall and i'm sitting here like no. man i can't do it i can't. do it i can't do it. and as he goes to. punch the wall i link. my arm into his. arm and i stop him from hitting the wall. and i say i can do it. okay now hugh jackman. still loaded in this bit. right we're both still meeting eye. to eye in this bit hugh jackman. now is acting like he's pissed. at me as the bit. he's like hey mate what. are you doing i was trying. to punch a wall and i was like oh yeah what [ __ ] that you know like you can't do that and then he starts coming at me going to. tackle me pushing me back. against where the exceptionary is of this. waiting room that never has ever existed. on any movie set in the history of the world okay so as he's pushing. me back i'm like falling. backwards and [ __ ] but it's all like we're hamming it up because we're in the bit dude all right and he's going to. punch me and i as i'm falling. back reach back to. grab an imaginary knife okay. in the dream in the dream. the knife is imaginary. i'm doing a bit in the dream. of grabbing this imaginary knife. and i say out loud. as hugh jackman is. tackling me i go he grabs a knife. and stabs it in the back. and i [ __ ] go i put it over hugh jackman's shoulder and i land. it and i sink that fake bit. knife right into his the back. of his shoulder blade i say oh he grabs a knife and stabs it into. hugh jackman's back and then hugh jackman. goes and then he pushes back. further right and then i say on the other hand. i say oh he grabs an iron. and smashes it over. hugh jackman's head oh and i say this out loud and hugh jackman goes and then i say he grabs an orange because that's the only thing that's left and he squeezes over squeezing. it over his the back. of his neck and i go and i go and that's when i woke up i woke. up grunting because i was saying out loud. in my [music] dream grabs. an orange because that's the only thing that's left. and squeezes it over. the back of his head. while hugh jackman. was tackling me in night/. samurai gear and i wake up. and i go and kristen says oh my god honey are. you okay like i don't know in what sense. am i okay as dude. i was dying and

[ __ ] song came out it was from that album that would go plank plank. plank plank plank that song. you know he loved that. song he couldn't dude he would roll up in his [ __ ] jeep sprangler to. my house pick me up. and go to. georg's and just plank plank plank. plank [laughter] plank that big ass. jacked [ __ ] on the violin that big jacked dude. in the dave matthews band with the violin. that you know that wasn't even. violin that was a full base. he was just that big. just putting it on his shoulder. like it's a cellular phone plank. plank plank plank that guy died. at like 42 because he was just too big. and jacked and uh the doctor came in and he was like i'm sorry. but your husband passed away. and the wife was like why. and he said to. jacked and over the [ __ ] doctor's over the waiting room. music it was plank. plank plank plank plank and my buddy. loved that song and uh then the new dave. dave matthews album came. out and he didn't like it. and i was like hey you like that. dave matthew's album that. came out and he was like dude. no but you know what i think. and i was like here we go. here we go because i didn't like any dave matthews and not that. he's not talented he is dude. that's a sat i'm it's probably. good you know if you wear sandals. you love that song. you know what i'm talking. about if you wear button down. short sleeve shirts and shorts and sandals and that song comes on. you jizz that's period. that's it you jizz. so if a if a [ __ ] if that song comes on if a guy's in literally birkenstock [ __ ] forget it dude if you even the second you put on your birkin stocks the second that toe enters a birken stock right one of your toes just one you might not even know where another one is but you find one and you go to. pick it up and you hear pl. pl the immediate like a little bit. of jizz just you know. what i mean it. has to be you can hear. if you're a white guy. with like a side. part and a button down with cargo shorts. you can hear plank. plink plink and not go jizz. and you can also wear birkin stocks and not go. jizz but the second you get your foot close. to a birkin stock and you got all. that aaron and you hear pling then. immediate side jizz right. immediate hip jizz okay so my buddy. was saying to me um yeah you know. what i think i said what he said. i think he purposly made an album. that was so bad to. see if his fans would still like it. and pretend that it was good. and i just go like this. oh but people don't do that. pl pl pl pl we have a silly. time and we have a good time. right and that's what we do. that's what we do i don't. uh so when the [ __ ] is kanye. coming out with this album mostly i. don't care but mostly i'm. just like i want people on the internet. to shut the [ __ ] up about it because when people come when people first of all i'm i'm off the internet the only thing i have is instagram and tik tok and uh youtube so that's a lot of the things but uh the thing is uh you don't i i don't i don't like cycle out. you know hey news. cycle it out kanye. west comes on oh when's his album. dropping oh who knows when's every oh but we don't. know and i follow lot of sneaker. pages it's always a sneaker page d's gonna drop what you gonna be wearing when d's drop it's like all right dude don't try to. be a part of it. you're just a sneaker page. but like i wanted to. because that's what happens. dude it's the lead up. to this [ __ ] and maybe this is what kanye. knows but it's always the leadup to. the [ __ ] that gets the [ __ ] and then when the [ __ ] happens five days later it's gone dude it's gone like all these movies come out like remember the [ __ ] war after tomorrow or whatever the [ __ ] that chris pratt movie is it was like you couldn't go you couldn't turn left on a street without seeing a billboard you'd put on your sunglasses and there'd be an ad in on the inside your lenses and the second that movie came out everyone was just like okay we're done talking about this nobody's going to.
