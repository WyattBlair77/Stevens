[music] feels good man i got my um my coffee from my thing that makes the coffee i got the app i just hit it and i made it and i made the coffee myself just by the touch of a button dude world's getting nuts you can just do stuff with the touch of a button i made a coffee with the touch of a button and uh i can't wait till you can work out with a touch of a button although i will say i've been heavy on this workout train lately it's been over a month now maybe a month and a half um uh it is something that is very cool it's the only time i'm doing something and i am literally thinking of absolutely nothing nothing i'm not even thinking of working out i'm just there going through the motions and it is so awesome because i just have nothing to. think about and it's an hour. plus sometimes where i can just i mean. i'm doing the most basic. thing a man can do which is just kind of picking stuff. up and putting it down. you know and sweating. so hard and i look around. dude and i gotta tell you man. people at the gym they don't really sweat. that hard now some do some do but there's a lot. of casual people that just go. in there to kind of like walk. on the stepper a little bit and then converts with some. people dude not me man. i talk to nobody now. yes did i talk to. an actor the other day. in the new show hijack. of course i did because i watched. hijack and he was there at the gym. and he came up to. me and said that. i was really funny and i said you know. what dude you look like the guy. from the show hijack and he said that's me. and i said dude. that show is awesome and it is apple. tv comes up dude they take the pedigree and they move it. up don't they they take the streaming. services they take everyone you. know you think oh you're streaming. services oh you know oh yeah netflix. oh hulu oh you know. amazon prime apple tv comes up. apple tv apple plus whatever the heck it's called apple tv plus apple plus apple plus what's it called who cares but you know what i'm talking about that thing whatever that is apple's streaming. service it goes like this. well hold the phone a little bit. paramount plus goes like this. will hold the phone. a little bit what about pedigree. right because you go on netflix. and this is how you pick. something from netflix. you go like this but you go to. apple tv you go like this. you go to batman. but let's go like this. you go to amazon. you go to hulu. you go to netflix. you go like this right. and then 10 minutes. later go like this but that's how it is but some streaming. services that got that pedigree max. kinda got that pedigree i like max. because it sounds like i'm gay. i like max um i like max. well i think about the hbo. thing that was the highest pedigree of all thing they had game. of thrones they had uh eastbound. and down they had ali g. show they had all the good. things um but yeah uh uh real sports. of bro brian gumbel today on real. sports they had hbo brian. gum was just underwater when he talks. but i have real sports. we're gonna be talking about the minnesota. sports um so yeah. um so i i i put on i watched. hijacking you know i don't they do. the thing where they gotta like apple. tv they released two or three. episodes and then and then you gotta wait every week. like it's still appointment tv. like how it was when you you know. in the 80s and 90s. so i'm watching it i'm all into. it anyway i see this. dude actor fine actor max beasley he's. great and uh was like bro. you're this show is awesome. my wife we're hooked and he's like. just get ready it's you know. it's a ride and i was like hell. yeah dude and i felt good. you know it feels good. you know the the it feels. good and then it's like you know. i'm like yeah i i when you like what. somebody does then you and then and then you meet them. you want to. let them know i guess which is what i did. and that's what he did. too so hey but anyway that show's cool. finished silo so good i found out that people are really mad at the uh final episode. that's crazy people are mad. at everything dude it was a great. show i love it um tim. robbins right uh rebecca ferguson. awesome every time common's in something. i'm always like oh god the [ __ ] commons in it and i don't dislike common. it's just like i don't think any dude. how about this only get actors to. do things and if you want get comedians to. play funny parts but like whenever it's like oh yeah. alicia keys is in it. and she like didn't put makeup. on for the role and everyone's like wow. for [ __ ] five days when it comes out. and then everyone forgets about. it you know what i'm talking. about or like lenny kravitz when they put him in the the hunger. game show it's like oh my god dude you could have really put a banger dude. in there if comment was played if the guy common. if common whatever i don't. know that's his real name common. johnson if he actually and dude. great rapper don't i'm not taking anything from him. and you know what he's okay. at acting but he's a rapper. dude and i know you can't be a rapper. when you're like in your 50s and 60s. because it's like a rapping is a young. man's game but like dude. when i when when common shows. up in a [ __ ] thing dude. i go like this here we go. when lenny kravitz shows up in a [ __ ] thing i go like this all right okay common just rap lenny kravitz just split your pants. and let your balls fall. out man when he did that i want to. get away i wanna fly rip. blog took out someone's teeth. in the front row. no way the penis goes yay says nothing that. part um so yeah anyway silo's a good. show now do the sets look kind of fake. yes is everything brown. yes it's all [ __ ] kanye did the costume. design yes but it's a good show. yes it is dude. are the things that are unexplained yeah. so the plot was maybe that's what we were mad. about the final episode it's okay. dude i don't know man. what people want anymore. every show kind of sucks. just chill these [ __ ] armchair experts that go in and was like well you know what this is actually that's the thing. everybody's a comedy expert. you know what i mean. you put up a clip. on youtube people are like people think this. guy's funny dude. you know how many people there. are seven billion there's that. many people think everybody's funny. right there's people that are straight. up dog [ __ ] and there's gonna be people that i think are funny it's subjective. dude you know um so i don't know what people want. like look i don't think that [ __ ] adam sandler movies. are funny but i don't you know. that's just me that. doesn't mean he's not funny. that means there's something wrong. with me there's something. wrong with me i don't. think certain comedians are funny. doesn't mean they're not good. adam sandler's [ __ ] fantastic. um funniest guy in the world. nick swardson there you go. you know no one funnier. brian callan these guys. bobby lee these guys are funniest people in the world um that's what i think uh uh but yeah you know uh so i [ __ ] so i i watch those shows and then and that's it and i don't care if they're good or bad dude and then i want to. get into other stuff too. but i also saw the american. gladiators thing on netflix guess. what dude i'm gonna come out. and say it you're making too many. documentaries about things when i first saw it. i was like oh cool. and then i watched halfway. through like the third episode i go. like this dude i'm only watching this. because i used to. watch the american gladiators that's so [ __ ] stupid that's so dumb what i did i go oh cool click and i watched the whole thing and i'm watching this thing and then they're trying to. play up like oh yeah. these guys were juicing. these guys did drugs and like they couldn't hack it. and one guy got fired another guy got fired. and the producers were trying. to rip people off and make money off the actors and they believed in the franchise. not necessarily the the actors and they thought that the franchise. was a star not the act. not not [ __ ] nitro and and and and and i'm watching this thing and for about three episodes. i'm like wow wow okay pretty scandalous. and then i'm like oh but it's actually not it's just boring. and oh oh no [ __ ] dude oh really gemini ice. [ __ ] nitro these big behemoth [ __ ] oh oh they did steroids no get out of here dude really that's not news a [ __ ] course the american gladiators did stero words i wouldn't i wouldn't watch them if they didn't how about that juice it up take injections [ __ ] hdh do the whole. steroid do it all be a chick. and do it be a woman and talk like this. come on ice oh really. some of the women who did american. gladiators were gay and it was hard. for them oh [ __ ] no [ __ ] no [ __ ] they were gay and juicing so i'm watching this [ __ ] thing and it's like and then one guy took a big hit and got that was it for him and they thought malibu. was going to be a big. thing yeah dude that's not it. and oh and the producers tried to. make money and they were on they were they were they were pissed. off that the actors were pissed. off that didn't get merchandising dude. this is just how the biz. goes ah [ __ ] huh. well whatever dude you know nobody died. i'm watching this and i'm like nobody died. zero people died they just did. steroids this is [ __ ] they're making documentaries. of too many things dude. netflix will just [ __ ] straight put out. the garbage man conspiracy. on [ __ ] main street and in [ __ ] seattle and you're like what and the whole. [ __ ] show was just and then one guy you know they start too early and they wake me. up all the time. garbage man conspiracy on netflix. eight episodes and people just eat watch oh oh really oh so they don't even really put the plastic in the recycling. dude did you hear a garbage. man conspiracy did you know. they don't put the plastic. in the [ __ ] thing ever since [ __ ] to. make a murderer or whatever. the hell it is. or uh who wants to. be a murderer or whatever. the [ __ ] with the [ __ ] guy it's like dude that was so onesided the guy so obviously went stabbing and netflix was trying to. make it like and there's [ __ ] out here that are just like we gotta free. the guy who [ __ ] stabbed gary you google. one [ __ ] thing about that thing and it's like oh but why did netflix leave the part where there were [ __ ] chains on his bed with handcuffs. could be a kink. could be but i'm just saying dude. anyway so i'm uh it's like i'd rather. just watch the [ __ ] uh you know and one day i was murdered or whatever. those things are in every episode. it's like about a neighbor. um but yeah there was one. unbelievable story about the the american. gladiator in that thing the dude. nitro really handsome dude. um and this is just so telling about um how insidious trauma. is right like when you're a kid. when you're growing up. like we've all had some sort of trauma. and um pia melody who basically wrote the book. on childhood drama was she did. write books on childhood. drama but she says anything. less than nurturing is trauma. and i don't know if i believe that. but everything affects you when you're [ __ ] five so in a way i understand. what she's saying um but this dude. basically this kid nitro when he was a kid. was ripped from his mom. his dad took him and he had to. leave his mom because his dad. was gonna take custody of him. so he was getting on the plane. leaving his mom and his mom was weeping and he was crying. so much right i don't know how old he was young. but this guy who saw the kid. and said hey buddy are you crying. and he said yeah and he says let me see your muscle. and the guy goes like this. and he points to. it and he says you got a little muscle. right there that means you're a man. and men don't cry. that [ __ ] thing this guy he's 58 now and he remembers that. and that's i would argue the reason. he got big and jacked and became american. gladiator isn't that [ __ ] insane and now he dude his brother died years later and he didn't cry he was like i'm not supposed to. cry because that guy said he was still a kid. but dude that [ __ ] that little grain of sand. plucked into that dude's brain. grew to be a whole [ __ ] and now it's [ __ ] up but foreign hopefully the guy knows and the guy did therapy and the guy's [ __ ] a little bit better for it now because man here's the other [ __ ] crazy thing dude that guy who told that kid nitro as a kid that isn't a bad guy he thought he was helping that's the most [ __ ] up like you don't even get to. be like as an adult. as nitro you don't even. get to be like [ __ ] that guy he's evil. you got to be like oh i was only. trying his best and now i'm [ __ ] up as you're on the [ __ ] the jousting eyes are in the big ball like a [ __ ] big muscular hamster yeah dude it's crazy trauma what it does man i had some yes dude so anyway i try to. like think about that with my kids. man dude i try to. think about it with my kids. um yeah a lot. of stuff man every dude. if you don't make a tv show. or a movie and have the character. be really like have he had some trauma. in his past you ain't. [ __ ] dude your show is for the birds. did you know that i watched. the dawn wall a lot of stuff. i'm talking about a lot. of watching a lot of stuff. and i don't even but man. it's a [ __ ] rock oh dude well let me just start with this. i want rock climbing well bouldering it's inside. it's not higher than 30. feet but you don't have to. [ __ ] rub yourself in and there's a big mat that even if you fall you do kind of get hurt. sometimes and i did i didn't realize how hard it was and i have [ __ ] six blisters on my inside. of my hands oh yes dude. and it hurts do. i still push through and work out yes have i yes does it hurt. yes do i bleed. all over the weights yes. do i watch them after. no but i you know. i don't i don't believe i got right. here see boom boom boom boom um anyway um a show. i went rock climbing. with the family well not rock. climbing bouldering with kristen uh two friends calvin and we even brought william dude. and they made william sign a waiver he's not even. three months they're like i know. it's kind of silly but just do it. for him more luck this. kid shoots his pants. oh he's not gonna be climbing. do i say okay. so i went there dude. and uh he says what size. shoe i said 13. he's like i'm gonna give you 13. and a half they run. a little small so i said okay. all right they were so small so i said hey man. give me 14. so small i said hey man. can get a 15. started doing a little bit. so small hey mac i get a 16. what's the deal here i need a size 16 rock. climbing shoe on the man. dude [ __ ] man i got big ass rock climb. my feet but anyway dude. it was fun got ripped. to shreds um my wife saw his [ __ ] dude she killed it because she's a gymnast dude she was just like just like frodo on on the [ __ ] thing just spiderman like the horror movies when the somebody's in the corner just up in the ceiling like this and then you turn the light on they're not there [ __ ] hate horror movies i love horror movies but i can't stand they all do the thing i watched that new one on netflix run rabbit run the second the the kid drew dark pictures with i'm out dude how many kids are gonna draw scribbly pictures of their family and like in a demonic way and they go like you know the the little johnny wrote he drew this and he go oh no and it i'm out i'm out foreign so uh we went bouldering and it was fun it was fun it's really hard dude it's really hard man it's so hard and you know me dude when i try something i get obsessed with it so what i do i left after you know a few hours one or two hours and not long and uh but i felt good you know and then i watched friggin 2 documentaries on rock climbing he's an addict folks he does one thing and he does it and then he does it forever uh so the dawn wall it's free solo i saw which by the way i am going to tell this right now i didn't like free solo oopsie daisy everybody gets mad when i say this why because the dude is quite obviously a goddamn sociopath you don't feel for him because he doesn't feel for anybody dude the guy goes like this hey i love you to a new chick that he was with and then she says i love you too uh he says gotta got a free solo though and she's like what if you die and he goes i i don't have to tell you i gotta just get up there she's like but he's like adam carrie leave me that's just about so um but that sociopaths make up for in grip strength i'll tell you that much so i watched the dawn wall which is about this dude man who when he was a kid dude he got abducted by [ __ ] like uh afghani soldiers while he was trying to rock climb and kurdistan i don't know where anything is but. um because i'm racist and uh and he was doing. it and they and they took him and his girlfriend. and the one guy went off to. get food and then the dude. was with his girlfriend and the dude. that was watching them. from the army or whatever. it was i don't know anything. uh he he says to. his so the guy who says to. his girlfriend hey i'm gonna have to. push him off the ledge otherwise you know. he's going to kill. us and she was like he's like i have to. do that and she didn't say. anything and he was like i took that as she would be okay. with it so he [ __ ] pushed the guy off the ledge. and the guy died he had to. [ __ ] dude i thought i was watching a rock climbing. documentary and it's still a documentary. about murder my wife. watches that [ __ ] all the time do you know what i'm saying. and i'm like always trying to. get away from the murder. documentaries i thought i put on like a happygolucky friendly. rock climbing movie this guy still is a murderer. unbelievable but it was either. him or him and he took care. of it and then they trauma bonded. him and his wife and they got married. they loved each other and then they ended. up breaking up because they say people who meet under high. pressure situations they don't necessarily work. out all that way and when we learned that well we learn that from where we learn that. from speed right cassandra bullock. says that took generals all the time. um so anyway they're rock. climbing now and this guy is like survived that. that's obviously shaped them. right dude you got trauma. like that you're congratulations. you're shaped right. ah [ __ ] you had to. kill somebody's to. to save your and your love's. wife oh [ __ ] you're done. got shaped right. that's what happens you see. a car accident when you're six whoopsie. you got shaped you. got a babysitter that. tried to do some [ __ ] with you. oh you didn't get shaped. this guy had to. throw someone off a cliff. in kurdistan whoopsie he shaped. forever so now the dude. is like killer rock. climber the best rock climber. starts doing really well so he's killing. a rock climbing and then he's building. something and doing using one. of those saws cuts. off his finger more. trauma and his supposed. rock climbing career got thrown out the window. because now he's one figure less dude's got nine fingers. the only thing you need is a rock. climber is fingers you don't. even need eyes there's a blind. one i swear to. god i saw a blind. one on the documentary. he was just feeling around. like this it's just like [ __ ] ray charles out. there just oh there's a spot and clement. he's still alive so all you need are. fingers and this dude got his finger. cut off and guess what that. did instead of ruined. his career shaped them. he goes like this extra trauma. scoop that up let me get all shaped. up so this guy became i [ __ ] you not a better. rock climber dude better than anyone. better than his past. self he was doing [ __ ] he's never done. before and guess what dude. he never would have been able. to do that if he didn't push a guy off a [ __ ] cliff. when he was younger. and kill them because that shaped. his mentality dude you. could either be a victim or you could done. get [ __ ] shaped that's why. we say grow or die. baby we gotta find the guy's name. but it's so disrespectful if i don't know the guy's name um the dawn. wall uh tommy caldwell best note so so i'm watching. the dawn wall and i'm like this. is the documentary app. [ __ ] people watching free solo i got all the awards oh [ __ ] all [ __ ] out of here with that [ __ ] this is what i want to. talk about i want to. watch this guy because he's got the personality. baby and you know look let's face it. if you're a rock climber. you're gonna be [ __ ] weird right. you just got to. be a goddamn weirdo. hey what you do. climb and you're not seven. you create you got to. be an introvert weird or autistic. kind of guy i don't even. mean that to be funny. it's just such a specific thing to. just keep climbing rocks yeah. um so man i did not realize how much grip. strength they need i mean i i gotta i gotta use like this. and these dudes are just like these dudes are just they rock. climb they're like this they go. like this fingers and holes. and i'm just like wow dude. so uh uh yeah uh i'm sorry. i tried it i try. to do it i'm not i'm not. good at it but i'm gonna go. again we mean why my wife. want to go again. calvin was on there on the little ones. it was really cute. really cute um god isn't it. you know what i was waiting. for is the cow the the the the day. like there was somebody in my family. i remember who it was but then when they were younger. really younger when they saw their first asian. person they looked at them. and they went ching chong ching. chong ching chong and it was like they were you know three you don't know better. and you're like oh my god oh god. it's so racist you know. but but they're also three and it's just a society that's showing them. a cartoon or something and now that's what they do. oh [ __ ] it so i mean that's so bad god. but keep with the kids. um anyway i was like what's what's gonna happen. when cal because like we expose him. to you you know you want to. expose like we don't always buy the white. action figures or the you know. what i mean like we wanna. you know and in his school. he's got it's it's a you know. it's a bit of a melting pot. and like thank god you know. because we don't we want him. to be exposed to. every kind of looking person because god forbid you know. they [ __ ] grow up only with one type of person and then they they think people are look people are different. and that's okay but anyway was on a walk. with calvin and this like beautiful. tall dark woman walked by uh with uh and she was maybe like i don't know what she was really not africanamerican if you can't even say that nowadays but like uh something else i don't know because i'm a white guy um and she walked by and calvin said let me let me get this quote right calvin. said um uh she's brown. like sheriff toaster and has. boobs like mommy and you know. what he was right. google sheriff toadster sheriff toadsters brown. he's from the [ __ ] video game that he plays and that woman was brown. and she had boobies. like mommy so what can you do. for my money it's better. than ching chong ching chong when you see an asian so oh yeah yeah yeah that's what i did. yeah she's brown like you're brown. like sorry man but i don't i wouldn't have said it. but he actually does you are brown. like sheriff toadster and you know. my wife has boobies. uh so anyway it was nice to. meet you uh come on calvin. let's go [music] so i'm like oh it. happened the thing happened and that's a good. one sheriff toadster you know. um been working out i [ __ ] worked david out. hard dude you know he i made him do we did. box jumpsuits after we were doing uh chest. workouts and he jumped off the box and i was like we gotta go into a pushup. we jumped out the box. oh and couldn't do a pushup almost broke his [ __ ] nose on the ground. it was amazing and uh i don't realize i go.

[ __ ] love it um and uh she was like can you go get these photos that i printed. out at walgreens and i go like this. yeah you know why good dude. right so go to. do it and she was like and i get there. and the guy's like it's gonna be about 15. minutes so i was like she told me. prematurely all good no. big deal i'll walk across the street. to starbucks so i do and um i go to. a starbucks that i haven't been to. in a while years i used. to go there a bunch i lived in there. there wow i actually lived near. there and just thought about it. jesus wow that'll be a trip. to go back to. those apartments anyway i walk into. the starbucks first of all. on the patio no furniture which there's always like people. hanging out i walk inside. no furniture no furniture in starbucks. but it's well open so i walk up. man i'm gonna get a coffee. already no actually no i want to. get a salad and they don't have salad. so i'm like oh now i came here for no. reason and i'm pissed but at least i can gain information. i'm curious where the [ __ ] is the furniture so i say to. the lady hey um why is there. no furniture in here and she said. man we've been having so many incidents that upper management just told us. we can't have furniture about it. we can't even have furniture anymore. because we can't have people in here. and i was like so you just you just you. can come in and sell and get coffee. and you got a leaf. and she's like yeah i'm like whoa. dude the world is going. to [ __ ] starbucks can't even have furniture anymore. what are incidents too you. know it has to. do with like homeless people [ __ ] on the floor. and like fights like fighting. and oh god oh my god dude. this is so crazy. they can't have furniture stop asking furniture anymore. it wasn't even like it. was like vineland and ventura. it was just some place. that you might be like oh cool. starbucks you're going no furniture i should have just sat. on the floor and drank a [ __ ] iced. espresso um absolutely bonkers. bro what's with this [ __ ] uh uh elon musk now. is putting the new paywall on twitter. where you need an account. just to retweets now which is cool. whatever and you have to. pay for twitter blue. verified access to. see more than 600. posts per day and if you don't have that you can only see 600. posts or less and wow. i think that'll change things. right i don't know how many i don't look at twitter but like how many posts do you typically. see in a day. i would think i well i don't use. it so i'm a bad judge of it. but i would think no there's probably people who [ __ ] see thousands. right there's probably people that scroll. all day you're not gonna be able. to do that unless you pay which you'll pay probably but elon musk. continues to blame twitter's new limitations on ai. companies scrapping vast amount of data as he announced new temporary limits atom board and i'm bored. oh wait hold on. and for new unverified accounts. it's just 300 in a day. yeah people with no twitter. account can never see a tweet but are there people that look at twitter that. don't have twitter oh yeah. because you don't have twitter if i wanted you to. s if i had twitter and you didn't and i wanted. you to see a link. with twitter you can't be a lot. more screenshotting dude um the limits for verified. accounts presumably whether they're bought as a part of twitter blue. subscription granted through an organization. or verification you'll enforce some people like stephen. king lebron james and anyone else um still allow. reading only a maximum of 6 000. posts a
