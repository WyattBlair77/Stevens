of the different cities. man it's crazy dude. and i'm adding more we're adding more for the end. of december but we got um cincinnati. and columbus boise salt. lake city uh tucson. i said that already colorado springs. pueblo colorado for some reason. charlotte knoxville little rock arkansas for some reason and then a bunch of canadian. dates detroit cleveland fort. myers for some reason. in orlando florida dude. um yeah man that's what's up. i got my nice you know. what i started doing. lately actually is dressing nicer during the day. and i've been feeling a little bit. better dude and not today. but other days i've been feeling a little bit. better because here's the deal. look i i got nice clothes. look it's no it's no. secret that i i have nice clothes. there's no secret that. i've got a lot of nice. clothes come on and i always save. them for night time because i'm like nighttime the freaks. come out at night the freaks. come out at night right. and i hope we don't get copyright. strict because of how good that. was but um you know i'm good. i'm really nice with it. when i put my stuff on. because i'm not the guy who says hey check out. these cool clothes on me. i'm thinking here's me in these. clothes right these threads are. lucky um but yeah the show you know the shirt's carefully draped. over my shoulders and all that. stuff and it's nice tight. where it needs to. be forgiving where it needs. to be but yeah so i'm doing it. at night and then i realized dude. your boy's got a budget. look it's no surprise though. your boy has a lot. of nice clothes why doesn't he wear because sometimes. they don't wear the clothes. that are nice in the day. are you like me. do you not sometimes we're close. that are nice in the day. because you don't want to. have to wash them. and then what if you need them. for the night time but it's like dude. if you have enough nice closes. then all you got to. do is just wear nice clothes. all the time and yeah maybe you don't. get to wear this nice you. know thing at night but it's okay. dude so i'm just a little bit nicer. in the daytime also. i don't know if this is a stage. shirt whatever dude it's all really important. stuff but um anyway i'm having a good. time in life and i'm feeling. good i'll tell you what man. some days uh when i put my phone away. and i go out and i live life. my my my uh my my you ever. do that you ever lived like the 90s. because when i was in rehab i didn't have my phone. and sometimes i you know. like if i'm on the road i have the flip. phone and sometimes i just i'll leave my phone in the car. when i do that my my my because zoning. in on your phone you're probably not realize you're doing. it you're probably doing it right. now right you look at what you're looking. at right you're on you listen. to my podcast on your phone. and you're also checking instagram or tick. tock what are you doing. dude we don't want to. be living that life you want. to live that my my life. right so i put my phone. uh away a little bit. and it was just nice. dude it was nice i feel the urge. to go check it but it's nice. right it's addiction. but it's nice did i want. to check it yes did i get the hankering. yes did i avoid it. sometimes that i check it. sometimes did i give in to. the hankering yes sometimes all the time. no when i didn't i felt better. i felt a little bit. of anxiety but that's where the cbd. comes in pure spectrumcbd dot com. there we go congrats. um yeah i went to. the park and i went with uh calvin. and a friend and it was just my my it. was so cute and he met. little boy there and i'm at the dad. and we had a good time. just playing around in my son. uh walked up to the boy. and he he goes like this. right in his face like when i say say. hi to my eyes. when i say hey hey calvin say. hi calvin will just walk up. to someone's face like like this. like he wants to. start a fight like in his in his face. just hi and uh and he says to. the boy what you doing. tonight in the meantime it's it's. like four it's like 3 30. it. says to the boy. what's he doing tonight. that's his thing now. it's what you doing tonight don't know. where he heard it. it's like he was watching like night. at the roxbury or something. but he's just what you doing. tonight and he always walks. around what you doing. tonight and it's hilarious. and so cute and so i was at the park. and it was really nice man. i was at the park. and the dad was at the park. and we started talking a little bit. you know the other kid. was three and calvin took his face in his hand. his his face in the boy's hands. and he says one over one. is want to. roll around and the boy's like okay. and they just were rolling around. it's beautiful to. see uh the threeyearolds like do the socializing and stuff. because it's not it's not you know. they it was that that switch. flips boom they're a person. right like as soon as uh as soon as will i didn't know. i was gonna call him. willy my nilly but i was like is that. a little bit but it's not though. as soon as willy. came out william billy boy. i don't know what we're calling him. yet but um calvin all of a sudden. he goes and becomes an older brother. and so now he starts. looking like he came down. in a suit the other day. not really but you know. um yeah man so calvin's. getting older we're all getting older and life. isn't forever but life rips and that's the motto. and you either grow or die. don't you we got a lot. of mottos but that's it dude. life's about motto. is kind of is what i'm saying. by the way it's hot. it's hot as all get out in this little room. right now so i'm telling you right. now if you see a cut even the patreon. version it's because i gotta go. get some air okay [music]. we got rid of calvin's. nap and uh because a pediatrician came over and she was just like uh you know what if he's just not doing it. just go ahead go ahead. and we're like all right so he's been extra tired coming. like eight o'clock but fighting. it you know he'll be like this. from for on and you're just like calvin. you get tired and he's like this. no and you're like don't need to. be think about it and right. and so that probably means if you're snapping like that you're tired. but you don't know about life. yet like that right you're tired. and he's like no i know. that's big giant pacman. to doing tonight and um so i say to. him uh all right. well you let me know. when you're tired okay. he's obsessed with when i put him to. bed and i'm not gonna talk about my kid. the whole time i know. the audience is split i want. to talk about my kid. and when i don't talk about my kid. some people love it. extra and some people are like dude. stick to the silly. goose times and i'm like why. can't it be both. but also you know but uh he's obsessed with leaving. the door little open. for some reason my son gets locked boy i see a lot of me and i'm right. he gets up he gets locked. in sometimes like we started leaving. the door open for the bedtime and now we're just like it's the door. will open door will open we'll put him. in bed he says open. i'm like kevin i always leave the door. a little open okay. that what you doing tonight don't wanna. open and then i'm like he's like where are you. gonna go and i'm like downstairs. he says no stay up. here and then rolls over. like like such a dick. you know no stay up. here i want you to. stay up here okay i'll do it. and then i go and i stay up. here for a little bit and then i step. down but um he's been getting. so tired lately because he's been you. know skipping his nap and dude. he was like holding on by. a thread it was like 8. 10 and he was just holding. his sleep sack just ready. holding his sleep sack just ready. but fighting and i said buddy. you doing okay and we were downstairs. not even close to. his room and he just says yeah i'm okay. and then he immediately snaps. and starts bawling and collapses. into my arm and says if the door. it'll open dude it was so funny. and so cute good. from downstairs from long just leave that. door little open just crying. and i was like okay. bloody you want to. go upstairs he says yeah don't let him. open dude kids are so funny. they're so funny they're just so funny. is the pool tooting he says when the bubbles come out. of the jet and i'm like if

fully. open which is like we're in la. that never happens. it's just open like there should be a lady. with an apron on singing. the hills are alive. in this parking lot it's open. to [ __ ] and uh i park you know where i park. wherever you know why because it's open. right i don't even go. like this a little bit i just drive. in park like i'm in a [ __ ] you know ben affleck. movie like the guy who gets the spot. and you're like that's not like how it is though. but it was is it. all right i'm i'm in gili right. now so a park two empty spots. next to me i park. right away into the spot. to my left now. that's a little annoying. why because like i said the parking. lot was open anyone support. right next to. me not only next to. me but where i gotta get out. oh hey dingbat park. a space away so i'm like all. right fine [ __ ] it i get out. i walk to. the coffee shop i get in the coffee. shop and that guy gets out of his car. walks in the coffee shop. i order my coffee and then that guy. orders his coffee and then that. guy picks up his phone. and he says yeah what is it. okay yeah yeah okay yeah okay well there's it yeah okay and then he looks at. me and he says uh guy asks you to. move your car and i go. huh he says telling you. to move your car. and i said what what. hey what phone call. are you getting he's pointing to. his thing saying guy asking you to. move in your car. and i say your friend what. are you and he just goes like this. go out there already i'm pissed. but also maybe there's a good explanation. also i'm curious as [ __ ] you know what i mean this is like one bad guy into. the video game silent. hill i'm like all right. i think maybe i'm into. this i go there's another guy on the other side. of my car parked and he's too close. to my car and he can't get out. and he says to. me hi uh can you move your car. hey are you listening guys step. one i park in an open. field step two guy parks next to. me hard for me to. get out step three a guy. parks next to me. on the other side he can't. get out step four i get called. to move my car. hey are you guys listening. so i say you want me. to move my car. right back nobody was there and these two armenian. dudes are just like because also look i love armenians. you know but you guys are ready. you guys are ready i've never seen. a race more disres more ready. to be disrespected than a [ __ ] armenian. guy dude like armenians are. the number one men and women. you could just be like wow. look at that guy's got a bunch. of flowers he's like hey hey you don't say. flowers around me [laughter]. you say what get this. get specific when you're talking about. them bro what kind you know. are they roses. are they daffodils i don't know man. they couldn't be [ __ ] bird of paradise. you just say flowers you disrespecting me. like i might not know. what type what type they are. dog and i'm just like i swear. to god and then the chick. is in the background like he said. flowers and you're just like oh what's happening. with two phones and [ __ ] and so um so i'm like you want me to. move my car and he says yeah but he's like here's the thing. he says yeah in such a way. that it might be foreign. enough to wear oh [ __ ] now i can't really be that mad right. because i don't know if he's just got the language. barrier thing that makes him seem like a dick. when he really wishes. he could be a nice guy. because let's put yourself in uh spain. put yourself in spain. you don't know spanish. unless you do but you know put yourself in nobody who listens. to this podcast knows japanese. put yourself in japan. right you don't know. japanese you know a little bit. of japanese and then some guy's in the way. and you're trying to. get into the bathroom. you don't know japanese right. so you might be like uh uh you might not move. right you might just be like ah and then the guy's like he may. not know all the words ago. so you're like all right. forgiving so i'm like maybe he's not. being a dick i can't. really if he was an american. guy that just was born. here that had no accident accent. accident accident had no accent and he was just like hey move your car. i would be like yo bro. hey you're and here's the the other thing. too is the paint on my car. really hard to. duplicate it's matt so i don't want him. to dig it out [ __ ] so i'm like maybe it's not worth it so i say you know what okay i'll move my car i move my car a little bit and i move it back so he can get out and he says thank you i'm like alicia says thank you so i walk back in and i say to. the guy hey was that guy. your friend and he says yes thanks all good. all good all good. it was cool it was fine. it was good you know. i'm glad we got through. that all three of us. hey hey don't hey be more. specific when you're talking about. flowers what kind sunflower or what kind bougainvillas or what a a lily. or what what is it. the kind where you blow. and all those [ __ ] [ __ ]

[ __ ] water. tops oh so uh and then i'm in the [ __ ] coffee shop just not i'm thinking of it and this guy because when i pulled into. the coffee shop there. was a guy that was kind of blocking the thing. the the the entrance to. the actual parking lot. a lot of parking lot. stories and i go but i always try to. do the quick one bank bank. because the second you go bang. you're a dick and it depends on what the person's doing. you can do it back. if they're being an ignoramus or if they're trying. to be a dick. you could just bang. until they move so i go. time and he moves. all good
