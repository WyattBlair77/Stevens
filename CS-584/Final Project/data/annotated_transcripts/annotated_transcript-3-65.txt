[ __ ] throw a guy out and then you know it's all over the news. i throw out a [ __ ] 8 billion hedge fund dude. so the guy's like look we got plenty of phones. obviously he says yeah we got one. over here and he goes. like that and the guy goes oh. can i use it. he says um um sure i'm sure when i was a [ __ ] when i was in high school. i went with my friend brandon. goody and we went to. the shoe place to. buy some shoes and this. guy was so nervous man. he looked like at night. shyamalan and he was at the [ __ ] place. and he owned the shoe store. or no he was just the worker. the shoe store i don't. know but he looked like m night shyamalan this. was before m night shyamalan was. popping this was before. right back when m night shyamalan was. just known for making stuart. little right there was no are you. dead yet [ __ ] movie or whatever it's called [laughter]. are you dead yet. like it's with [ __ ] ice cube. are you dead yet. it's like a like it's a family. comedy with ice cube from the makers. of how the [ __ ] is ice cube. in family movies by the way. straight outta compton [ __ ] [ __ ] named ice cube. and like 15 later he's like did. y'all pack lunches did you eat your [ __ ] did you eat your breakfast boys. from [ __ ] the police do you like your eggs sunny side. up in just 11. years um and i was at the [ __ ] uh shoe place. with my buddy and my and and the and he was so nervous. and the end we were and we were like every shoe. we asked he was like do. you have these in a 13. and he would always say actually um we we used. to have these okay. [laughter] dude he did it. three times and we're like okay i guess we're just gonna go dude. imagine having a store and you go. in and you have to. say that three times to. somebody actually you know what we used. to have these but we don't have. them anymore and we don't have them. in your size and we left. and me and brenda. were like what the [ __ ] dude. how many times we actually. used to have them. and dude we don't do that. and i think about that. all the time we actually we used to. have them and so that guy. was so nervous telling us. that he didn't have the shoes. and it made me think of the guy. in the bank that was like do you have an outside. line he was like actually i already actually. used to have one. but now we use cell. phones and so anyway he was in the uh back. he was like sure you could use this. one and he goes like and he says and bro. the conversation i couldn't even believe. it the guy was like okay. cool and then the the guy. picks up the phone and then the the banker. guy he was like okay. um you just gotta hit nine. first and like we all know this. conversation right when you're out. of work you gotta hit nine. first sometimes you got to. be reminded for right. you go you start to. die like a [ __ ] [ __ ] one eight oh two you know you do the [ __ ] one eight one eight whatever the three two three and you and then it goes and you're like what the [ __ ] you don't hear anything you're like oh whoops i'm i'm a piece of [ __ ] today i i was i haven't used a phone in 30 years because this is what has been happening in businesses for the past 30 years and i didn't dial to. get an outside line. right and you say do it and then like an [ __ ] you'll be like do i have to. hit something first when you know you just hit nine. you they're never like yeah hit four. it's always nine so you're a big. piece of [ __ ] but sometimes you forget and sometimes it's okay right and if you're a homeless person or a billionaire you might be so out of touch on either end of the spectrum that you're like you know what i don't know how to. hit the chits i just work with my cell. phone so the guy's like picks up. the thing and then the banker preempts. that conversation and he says you have to. hit nine first to. get an outside line. and the guy says and then and then just and then what and the banker. guys like just no well that's it. just hit nine and then just whatever. you're gonna dial to. get the number and the guy says so then hit one. or or don't hit one. and he says well it just if if it's if it's the number. that you're gonna dial just you gotta hit the area. code and then the guy says so just the area. code and he says well no you hit nine. just to get the outside. line and he says right. and then i just hit the area. code and this is so loud. dude and there's literally like six people. in the bank and he's like so just hit nine. then you'll hit whatever it is. you need to. use and the guy says so nine and then one and then and then whatever. area code the guy says and i'm and i'm looking at the thing. like this i'm literally like this. and everyone is look it. was one of those moments. where something weird is happening. in an establishment and everyone. then knows each other you know. like one time a guy. came into the [ __ ] coffee bean. i used to. run over on cold water. i mean i used to. be the [ __ ] sultan of the coffee. bean and tea leaf. i used to. be the [ __ ] bean czar at coffee. bean and tea leaf. over on cold water and ventura. they don't have it anymore. right but i used to. be the [ __ ] bean czar over there. and uh i mean i used to. come home [ __ ] stinking like colombian. beans you know i used to. come home and it used. to be like i was having an affair. with some [ __ ] brazilian with a brazilian. roast honey where were you nothing i what is this it you smell you smell like south of the border i know i was at the were you rubbing. beans on your [ __ ] and so i was the beans. are so i was there all the time. and uh were you rubbing. show me show me your let me. smell your dick remember that song. let me smell your dick she's just i smell. a light roast i'm leaving gunk. oh come on baby so um i smell. pike drip baby gunk.

like she was like you're lucky. the other nurse isn't. here she wouldn't have all that. swearing and i was i got so mad. i was nice to. know that i got so mad even though. i was high i was like you're not going to. tell me what to. do i just went through. knee surgery i was still me. dude and i was like same old me drugs don't change. me and then so um so i i was like so i asked the doctor later. i was like i tasted. like i was licking. an envelope uh when i was passing. out i was like was that actually the drugs that i was tasting. or was that in my mind. because i was high and he said oh it was in your mind. it was the drugs working on your brain. making you think you tasted it and i was like wow. and then kristen made me get a [ __ ] i v drip. two weeks ago. and he [ __ ] put the bag in it looks like a bunch of piss i mean. it just literally looks like piss. like a bag of piss. that he's [ __ ] putting into. my veins never done that. before and kristen likes to. act like she [ __ ] will do a an iv drip. and it saves her. life like chris will be like ah [ __ ] i have a little headache. i'm gonna do an iv. drip and it's gonna cure me. and i'm like you just you just you. just
