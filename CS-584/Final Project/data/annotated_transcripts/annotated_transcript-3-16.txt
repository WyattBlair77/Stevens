right ice age yeah so um no. but i i saw he was on a plane. of mine oh he was on. a plane with me and he he was sitting like maybe one behind me. and i would i i would look back. and like that's the [ __ ] guy then i didn't really know his name you know it was like years. ago i was like that's that. [ __ ] guy that's the bad guy in the james bond movie all right yeah yeah and he was reading a script. and he was just like reading. the script like this. and the light was on it. i mean it was so cinematic. nighttime flight and he was just like turning. it over and i was like he's so i mean maybe this is [ __ ] me but like you know succumbing to. hollywood but i was like dude. he's so an evil. villain yeah he's yeah. totally i mean he's a great. actor you know what he got huge. he was always a popular. actor but he what made him. huge is that show he was on was playing. hannibal lecter oh yeah that's right. playing hannibal lecter probably such a goofy. show but yeah also was he the lead. of the [ __ ] pusher movies is that was like first [ __ ] i don't know. what that is uh all right. well since nobody knows anything in his i mean. this is literally yeah i'm willing to. help me talk about nicholson. for nine nine minutes everybody loves mad though. i know but people don't even know who he is. though we show him on the screen. right now and they'd be like oh yeah that guy. true he's super super handsome in a weird. way how much money has sex dude. it's so quick valhalla rising and this is how he has an orgasm. he goes a kiss and that's it. that's the whole orgasm that's. the whole orgasm but then in a few. minutes like in the shower. whoever he had sex with hears. him with the door closed. she hears him off like in the bathroom. just go hey what's he doing. he's just like getting the energy. out that's ridiculous dude. all right it does um well let's go. into some some uh uh what do. you call them submissions submissions guys let's go into. some submissions and i'm wearing sweats and i feel. bad i'm wearing sweats why but i'm having a chillaxing. i sometimes i used to. feel that way but now i wear sweats whenever the [ __ ] i want but yeah but yeah all right. let's do it all right. sansom put up matt and chris this. is josh from detroit. i was hoping to. get a little bit of advice. from you guys so my wife and i have a dog. that we take out three. times a day right. um the issue is though our dog. is cute as hell so everybody. always wants a small talk with us. about our dog you know. and tell us about their dogs. um which is normally like totally fine. but we live on the 21st. floor of our apartment and so i've been finding myself. just locked in in an elevator yeah forced into. small talk with people when i don't always want to. like i generally think of myself. as like a nice person. um and like i don't mind talking with people. but i've just been having the same. conversation over and over and over and i don't always want to. um but i also don't want to. be a dick so i've found myself. in this situation where i'm like forcing myself. to make small talk and it's kind of driving. me crazy so i was just wondering what do you guys. think i should do should i you know. just continue forcing myself to. smile and talk to. these people just because like that's what a good. neighbor does or should i just give up and be a dick. i don't know what do. you guys think appreciate any animal. advice that is so oh that's so funny. i got a good news. on 21 floor i got a good one. and i don't mean the [ __ ] small ass earbuds that people can miss i mean have the big honky tonk [ __ ] headphones that's a great. idea even if even if you don't own. them and they're expensive. if they're good obviously buy a [ __ ] pair. on ebay and they'll have the big honky tonks on. both ears and then just like even if there's no music. in it just be like bob. in your head and talking about it. you know and then if they if they ask a question. just go yes right. exactly that's exactly right. yeah yeah it's exactly. right wow wow feeling your tits. okay uh uh yeah that's a great. you know what i'm saying or if you want. to do the earbuds. you can do that and just pretend you're on the phone. yeah yeah yeah okay cool yeah. keep pretending i'm on the phone. is the most the the one. i've done the most i do that. without earbuds so you just look. like a crazy guy yeah. exactly yep uhhuh and then they go. and they go i go okay. no just indicate that there's like another person. in the room but they're invisible. yeah like what what's the matter. you know the guy here yeah yeah um yeah honestly. uh that's horrible the living in the 21st. floor is incredible so dude. i'm sure that takes sometimes. 15 minutes to. get downstairs that's that's too. many floors but it's detroit. though right that's what he said yeah. i know so it's like there's buildings. that are go crazy in detroit. it's like uh buildings. growing it's like you might start. on the third floor. book highrise the jg ballard. yeah yeah the movie they made a movie about movies. absolutely [ __ ] i heard the movie. was menacingly terrible and uh menacingly. terrible raves crystallia menacingly terrible yeah if you want to. see the most menacingly terrible. movie uh yeah really really uh really bad. movie and uh the bookstick i've read the book. okay well let's go i read. the book all right look. if you're that's so annoying. so if you're if you're i think don't live on the 21st. oh if you live on the 21st. floor don't have a dog. don't have anything cute but if you do get headphones. even if they're the chords cut just yeah it doesn't matter yeah. yeah and then when people ask. one more one more time. yeah yeah yeah foreign look at this. if if a black guy comes love mountain. but where's my pictures i love mountain. but where's my pictures like you're not saying it. right there's nothing in your ears. it would be the weirdest the weirdest. thing to experience you. know i love mountain but where's my bridges. i love my where's my [ __ ] the problem is if they do say something you gotta pretend that you don't hear because if you're like if you're like that and then you're like yeah my [ __ ] what's that yeah yeah you know yeah that's bad it'll

[ __ ] tied it up. huh he goes yeah. i didn't know that nope. i'm telling you right. now that did not happen. it happened dude which i understand. something you added up. what's interesting you said you. realized that your yeah you help. me thank you girlfriend i forget. what it's like to. realize that because i realized it. when i was five years. old and i have not wavered since i realized it. in in dad's balls. no i realized it in in mom's. uterus no but that's bob's been dead. salts first no i since she was born she's had her eggs that creates new sperm. all the time so i've literally noted since i was in mom's. uterus i realized one of her. godgiven eggs i hate that. i was [ __ ] badass and that's fine. but i realized it in grandpa. bam's balls hahaha what he was doing. newspapers in 1920s he was selling. newspapers and [ __ ] right and he was doing a get your newspapers on the corner. of times square and [ __ ] right and then [ __ ] i was in his balls like this you know what i'm pretty [ __ ] badass i'm getting up. yeah no dude you know. i realized it like early. early on like uh back. um you know when that pope. were related to so. his cousin were related. to the pope through his cousin. i realized how badass i am. in that guy's [ __ ] balls in the like the 1500s and the pub's balls in the pup's cousins balls i'm badass well shooting out um all right cool so it's not really just going to. hell so let's take a uh another guy. right now god just goes like this. huh that sucks and push the hell button so uh let's do another. one here yep wow. hey what's up though the coolest. videos are sleep live podcast. asleep uh what do you do. in your sleeping time oh [ __ ] and forget. about that but if you're to. work a normal job. well you don't hold it. steady like what would you expect hourly. like how many hours would you expect to. get a week and how much would you expect per. hour have you worked if you were to. work a normal job. no that's it you know. peace out let me guess you want. less hours i'm gonna take a wild. guess that this guy wants a little bit. less out gonna use this. podcast to go in and talk to. his boss yeah totally yeah so i don't know if you're familiar with this. so i don't know if you're familiar because if you're brothers. and they said that. i should be getting like 25. an hour yeah and i certainly be working. three hours well i don't even know dude. i haven't done like an hourly. what is he what is he talking. he's saying if you were gonna have like a regular job. me but like i wouldn't i know man. but he's obviously he's asking to. take a leap with him okay. he can't be so [ __ ] literal i'm literal. dude uh okay so he's asking if we were uh to. get a normal job. what would we expect to. work in terms of hours. per week and then what do we expect our wage to. be and the answer is it. depends on the [ __ ] job yeah really ass head yeah ass head get a job as an asset you'll do really [ __ ] well so dick uh get a job judge judy would say that why don't you get a job as an asshad if it's like if it's working at a mcdonald's i would expect about minimum wage and i would expect maybe 30 hours a week i i don't know uh if i was working as a [ __ ] uh landscaper. i don't know a little bit. more a little bit more. but 12 an hour more. yeah but what's minimum wage it's more. yeah i know so i'll maybe expect i'm with it. eighteen dollars an hour or it depends if i was like yeah. if you're talking about just a regular job. in an office though. i actually have no [ __ ] idea yeah uh where if you need a skill yeah he ain't your guy. right no but i'm saying if you need a skill. then you get paid more i think if you just are a body. yeah then you get paid. minimum wage or something like that what is this [ __ ] question it's why it's called the unskilled labor. force it doesn't mean you can't do [ __ ] it just means you don't have skills that weren't a higher. paying that's something the unskilled labor. of course yeah i know. yeah oh okay cool um so expect minimum wage and expect the uh amount of out. the best amount of hours. you could get because then you want the most amount of money. and also how much do you want to. how many hours a week. do you want to. work does he want to. work i want us to. work zero hours a week. yeah he doesn't want to. ever get out of bed. and stop smoking weed he's. also the kind of guy that goes like this. man i'd love to. make money in my sleep. yeah right passive income. passive income bro that's what. it is that's what it's all. about he says the words. passive income more than. he says the words high in his. life yeah hi he he greets. people less often than he says the words. passive income yeah yeah. so it basically open. your eyes more stop smoking. so much weed i know. this isn't the advice you asked. but take whatever the [ __ ] someone's willing to. give you and be happy. about it wow it's amazing. how much people work to. work their life away. though huh yeah but from what i understand. nobody's got a [ __ ] job right now nobody wants one and everybody's poor hmm i think the solution is all those people who are poor get a [ __ ] job it's a republican no but it's really [ __ ] uh it's so weird to. me that people want jobs. people want money everybody's. broke but there are jobs or places. that they can't [ __ ] they can't hire. anybody like they can't keep an employee. it is weird right. i don't there has to. be a reason that i don't get it. i don't get it we'll never get it. hey i don't get it. i'll go all right next one. hi chris hi matt my name is sam. i live in upstate. new york 27 next week these are my dogs. oh my god um okay so i'm gonna make this. really short my question is should i buy a house. so in 2020 i got out. of relationship me and him. live together in a home. that we picked out for like four years. i love an apartment. this is my second year. signing a lease i don't want to. live here it's like right. in the middle of like the bar. scene kind of going out um i feel like an old lady. i go outside and i tell people to. be quiet yeah that's my living room. window and there's like bar. seating right outside of it. so sometimes like i work overnight. i'm a nurse i go. outside i'm like hey not. for nothing but like let's stop screaming. anyway should i keep renting should i wait. until i find the one and then we buy a house. together should we find the one and then he has a house and i move in with him. or should i just buy my own. [ __ ] house like shit's expensive shit's hard i don't know if that's something that i should be doing alone hmm you know but at the same time i would love that i would love for them to. have a yacht cute. you want a yard. for them doggies here's the thing. always if you can get a house. if you can't afford one get one unless it's in the middle. of [ __ ] like some place where there's like a nuclear power plant. or there's some [ __ ] poison in the air. or whatever the [ __ ] it's always a good idea to. to buy a piece of property. if you can afford it don't go. over your head but like if you can afford. a piece of property. if it's in a she said upstate. new york i'm assuming there's like [ __ ] going on around. there she said there's bars and [ __ ] yeah if you can buy a house. in that area absolutely absolutely [ __ ]. do it and don't wait don't wait. you want your own house. because then you can sell it. if you want to. move in with another guy right. or another person whatever or if you want. to have them move. in you have that option. as well but like you want your own. [ __ ] go get your own renting is throwing money. away if you all know that if you can buy a house. buy it period always because you you know you'll probably buy a house. and then me to. do next the next week exactly. and then but then that's good you take. it slow you live in the house. for two years and then you move. in or whatever the [ __ ] or you sell that place. and move right but i'm just saying that. you then you lose some money. because of the closing costs. and all i mean only if you do that. right away in the first year. right right that's what i'm saying. so two years it's crazy. how we agreement right. freeze so um yeah i think that. uh also you'll be happier. because you don't want to. live right outside of the bar. you're a nurse yeah if you're gonna even. if you're not gonna buy move. yeah true yeah true and you got doggies and what'd. you say she was 27. i think did she say. it or did i make that. up i think she did so i thought she said she was. 26 27. anyway that's young you get a house. it's your first house congratulations. you'd be happy yeah and you'll get better. sleep and then also you'll meet a guy soon. and then you'll figure it out. and that's great and maybe you'll meet a [ __ ] baller. dude you know you're a nurse. maybe somebody will come in and be like i got a kidney stone and you're like oh [ __ ] that's not that. big of a deal you're gonna have a long life. ahead of you and also guess what i love. you oh wow and we love each other. and guess what oh you're a millionaire. had no idea where are we going. i'll sell my house i'll take care. of your darling he does. it like that very sure could be chauvinistic but also could be empowering because you're doing. what you want to. do right yeah it could be a lot. of things but just

[ __ ] though yeah i just [ __ ] pimp and pimping right here it out what do you think i love it well i love it and then what do you think of this i love it okay and what do you think of it no uh the tattoo of a [ __ ] on your dick. it was so weird getting monetized. now great good good. um yeah i think that that's a great. idea and we give great. advice and hopefully you figure it out. you're 24 though you will. figure it out and you will. have kids or just say you have them. dude [ __ ] yes i already have three with three different. women so what else do. you want to. know i've already got three three. different women of living hell. so thanks for bringing it out. what other sensitive questions. you want to. ask me that are going. to make me cry. do you want to. make me cry yeah. all right next how you do it. hey chris you read it. i'm getting a water hey christian matt. love the show my problem is that i get incredibly jealous. when i see other people living oh. wow living the life i want. to live especially moneywise and girlfriend wise. i get really jealous. to the point where it ruins. an entire day of my life. because i keep obsessing about it. so my question is how do i get rid of this. how do you guys control. jealousy well okay think of dude that's that's obsessive i have ocd. right okay so i get it. so you go ahead and then i'll join afterwards. there's different kinds of jealousy. if you have a girlfriend and you're jealous. of her wait and girlfriend what. oh oh okay i was just taking it. all is it i'm giving another example. of something that is different. than what he said first. okay okay you good okay. i'm gonna go keep going. okay uh so the first the the kind of jealousy. that you have you see. somebody no you have a girlfriend. you see her floating with someone. you're worried about her getting back together. with an ex whatever hanging out with guys. there's that kind of jealousy. but you're describing a different kind of jealousy. which is like i in my mind. much easier to. get rid of than the kind that. drives you crazy about your specific partner. out in the world potentially being with someone else this guy's talking about he's jealous. of other people's lifestyle the the amount. of money they have in the bank. uh potentially like maybe like an attractive. girlfriend and girlfriend he wants. dude those people are not they might as well not be real. they're outside of your reality. they're just like there it's like looking at instagram. of course we get jealous. of other people yep. like it's right in our faces not me. so there's no there's no uh if you're seeing it. first of all if you're seeing it. online stop going to the places. online that make you feel those things. now if you're seeing it out. in the real world let those [ __ ] pass you by and then just like another like a [ __ ] used piece of toilet paper. flush that [ __ ] on the toilet they're not like right in front of you in your life dangling their life like a carrot you're choosing to. to dwell on that instead. of dwelling on it [ __ ] go out there and get the money get the [ __ ] girl or focus on getting on a path that gets you those. things he's asking how to. combat first of all dude. you have these obsessive intrusive thoughts. and it's terrible and i have those. and i understand and i feel you know. it's different for me. what i think about but i do have those. intrusive thoughts and it sucks and i have ocd and i and it is really bad sometimes dude and i say that with no uh you know no shame or whatever it's just how it is and it sucks um but the way to. combat jealousy it was specifically what you're asking is. to think about the things. you're grateful about grateful for. like when i get caught up. i think i used to. you know i used to. think about my mom told me. this she was like when you get ah [ __ ] mama's boy. no no when you get ah she was i forget. camera how i felt but she was. like when you get this. way oh it was i couldn't sleep. because i was scared. when i was young. yeah and i'm a real man. you know me now right. well you used to. [ __ ] me up i know everybody wake up. yeah not scared interests or thoughts. okay about robbers and ghosts. and and freddy krueger yep. and freddy krueger and aliens. and just the quietness in darkness. so um okay sleeper and so what do you say. just keep going and so uh the guy uh so mom. said why don't you just think about uh your cousin's sleeping. peacefully and i was like that's very sweet. and i did and it helped. only a little bit but what i learned. is through this stuff like jealousy. especially it's really hard to. be jealous about stuff uh when you are. focusing on things that you are grateful. about because the truth. is everybody um is walking their [ __ ] path. you know if uh if you look at somebody. who seems to have. it all they might dude. i'll tell you man some people think i have it. all there are [ __ ] weeks where i cry. every single day it's happened. so it doesn't bother. no but it doesn't necessarily mean. you don't even know what you're. jealous of you don't even. know what you're just saying he's making up. a narrative and deciding. that that's better than what. he has dude first of all there. is what you should do. instead of being jealous. is focus on your actual goals. your literal concrete goals. not what other people already have. this is like you're making up. a scenario just for you to. be angry or upset. or jealous and the reason. you're doing that is because it's easier. than actually pursuing the things that you want. in the first place it's easier to. let yourself be like ah [ __ ] [ __ ] those people man i'm [ __ ] pissed it should be me well like go make it be you then and also let me give let me give this guy a little bit of credit too the fact that you even know you feel that way and can say i'm jealous about it even anonymously on this. podcast that is a huge step for uh growing. like you know jealous. do dudes they're like nah i don't give a [ __ ] [ __ ] that guy i'm the [ __ ] like he's not doing that he's not doing what a typical dude does he is saying this makes me jealous and i feel [ __ ] let it makes me feel less then right and that is a huge step bro so uh i got to. give you credit for that for real. because that's tough man. yeah it's the first step. is always the hardest. step about this because it requires it's not. it's not just not not lying. it's not lying to. yourself which is yeah it. is what you're doing which is the hardest. part dude you got to. be honest with yourself. even if you don't go around. [ __ ] telling people even don't tell anybody as long as you tell yourself. the truth it's not. about being hard on yourself. it's just about being honest. with yourself a lot. of myself i still lie. to myself well stop it i don't want. to stop that i try so hard. okay stop dancing maybe that's why. you can't because you're dancing. when you try to. do that i don't want to. lie to. myself wow that's how it begins. and then you start lying to. people you know sucks. dude damn that is a dumb. way to dance huh. dude it's so dumb. i hate it so much. i hate it oh. wait pull up that clip. of the dude pull up that. clip of the dude the car. thing dude pull up the clip. of the dude oh oh i think you know. how he sent it. to us oh my god dude. and he was chewing. god falling off a building. um there it is here we go. up up what was that. i don't know oh this. guy where it is there. it is this is the gun. was the best wow dude. that part dude what is he like is. he riding what is he doing. he's a shopping cart [music]. what a pimp dude. the belt's so low the belt's solo. to accommodate his [ __ ] dude ass hanging ass belly. at a ben's dealership dude. that guy sells 20 cars. that oh yeah dude. that's what he does when he sells a car. and um he he he's like he would literally be 20. pounds heavier if he if he didn't sell cards. dude that's his old exercise. yeah this part wait he doesn't like riding a tricycle or some. [ __ ] dude look how [ __ ] thick look how thick his wallet is in the back right pocket. dude watch when he turns. around watch look how thick look how thick. so thick dude it's blank dude. no dude that's so many different. business cards right right. and it's like it's like a hardee's. card a boston market card he's got a subway punch card. yep boston market dude wow guys is the worst diet too i. didn't realize my hat looked like this. holy [ __ ] boss terrible terrible terrible. you're just like one of the guys. with fat albert if you pull over your eyes. and cut the eyes out um all right. cool so let's do next. one my name's sean i'm from south. mississippi build roads here i've got several dogs. well two dogs but anyway i'm it's because this is a christian bell. character i know chris has several dogs and i know matt. you've probably had dogs yourself. yes sir what i'm wondering. is are there too many. dogs in a household. never is there such a thing. no um how do y'all. feel about different dog. breeds do you like mixed. breeds or mutts like we call. them or do you like pure breeds. the necklace size everything. set of characters just love to. know what you guys think. uh chris i can't wait to. see you in february in new orleans. hell yeah got vip tickets. so i'm excited to. i'll meet you see you in. person man very cool. take care that's so cool. i will be in new orleans. get your tickets crystalia. dot com um so here's the deal. there's no such thing as too. many dogs okay the the thing about living though. in is if you live in a city. or anything over two dogs it's like you might as well have ten one it's great two is great three and up dude it doesn't matter if it's [ __ ] 3 or 25. it's a pain in the [ __ ] ass. one is great two is great. one is a great. dog two is a great dog's. three you have animals. right but a bunch of animals. where he lives might be different. he might not be in a city. i know but so if you're not in a city. and you have land. where they can run. around dude you might as well have [ __ ] as many as you want uh as far as breeds go i mean i'm not really that specific but uh i think mutts will live longer and generally they're healthier so i always lean towards mixes of dogs. because they're less likely to. get degenerative diseases uh they're less likely to. have [ __ ] passed down from their uh you know their bloodlines like purebred golden retrievers. always die before that's why. the indicator with their family they get the [ __ ] up knees. they get the [ __ ] up backs they get cancer. a lot they get all this. kind of crazy hip dysplasia [ __ ] but that's for two of all kinds of purebreds. they're harder to. have because they die. earlier and more painfully usually because they don't got that. [ __ ] mixed up [ __ ] that sort of makes you healthier and better. at defending yourself from certain uh ailments. yeah mutts baby mutts baby. mutts baby mutts baby not. me dude not much i'm a purebred kind of dude. all right aryan nation kind of a dog. guy yeah right what aaron nation dog. guy well like aryan nation you know. what that is right. yeah but you can't be that. way because they're all different. kinds of that would only be true. if you only had one kind of breed of dog. i think that the pure breed. bred dogs there should only be one that's different. that could be any kind of breed. of any kind of breed there. should be one and it should be the golden retriever. and you don't have a golden retriever i don't. know but i wish i did. and if i did that would be great. but i think that there. should be one race. of dog so shitty do you call. it the area nation and every time. you lose your dog it. makes sense and if you lose. your dog it's fine. because you just find another one. and it looks just like yours. the world you're describing is one. in which i would not even. want to be alive that's how much i like dogs. what you heard what i said. i wouldn't want to. live in that world okay i want to. live in the world where i ho. i own all the dogs. i want to. live in the world where i own. thousands of dogs i have a big piece of property oh my god i have like the amount of dogs. that you see those like aerial. videos of sheep yeah herded. you know like that's the amount of dogs. i want wow all different breeds. baby every breed every breed under. the sun okay well we disagree. dude i think there should be one pure race. of dogs okay well yeah that sucks you're a [ __ ] idiot also you have four dogs that are all different breeds. uh so they're all mutts except for oh. i know no other ones a month. two of them are yeah cooper's not a man. no okay oh yeah no cooper. is cooper is yes and uh chenzo is shenzo's got 30. 000 different strands of. uh breeding dude at chenzo ran away. the other day again he didn't. mean to the door. the door was left open. and the gate was open as well didn't mean. to and it was it. was it was raining and i was like where's shenzo. and i walk outside. and i looked i look. down the street and he's just running. down the mountain running. down to me. and people are out of their cars. like trying to get them. yeah and you're just like this. and then and then i was like come in and he just goes and he just goes by. me and he goes in and goes in the door. wow it was so funny. he used to. run away and go everywhere. and we would never find him. god and this dog now just took a trip. and then came back that dog's really something he really is something dude he's starting to. he's really starting to. love me finally really yeah finally why. because i [ __ ] try to. be so gentle with him. and stuff dude dogs don't like you the dogs. dogs love me dogs never liked you cooper cooper. loves you yeah cooper loves me. that's because cooper would like anybody with a piece. no cooper loves me dude. okay but my point. is every dog loves me. well that's you're just because you're like user. friendly i'm really specific and my [ __ ] is like my [ __ ] pops when you like me you love me right. good good [ __ ] excuse uh you're basically mcdonald's. and my [ __ ] is like [ __ ] a really nice steakhouse nobody likes mcdonald's. dude no i'm saying the general. public it does really well but my [ __ ] pops like my specifically my [ __ ] specifically pops okay like when you know me you love me when you know me either hate me or love me when you you're not sure i'll have that no no him is to. love love love him thank. you hollywood is awful. no okay all right so next. one baby and booyah so. annoying radio from colorado. here um i need some advice. on my career so i'm a preschool. teacher cool i love it. it's amazing life rips every day. i've got 18 two and a half. year olds so it's very challenging but it's a perfect amount of challenging for me i got my degree. in human development so. oh cool basically just geek out. all this dude that's cool. um that's not a cool joke. but i don't get paid. enough money yeah okay that's pretty typical of preschool. teachers and teachers in general. i knew what i was getting into. when i started this. but i'm 24 i've got time. i've done retail jobs i've done. barista i've done waitressing like i've done. it all and it's just not as fulfilling. as this job this job. is perfect it's so fulfilling it. doesn't feel like i'm going to. work but i'm really starting to. feel the pressure financially. and it's very stressful i wish i didn't have to. worry about it and i think that i should get paid. more but that's just not how the system. works right now so any advice. would help thank you for. listening thank you for the podcast. and life rips i just want. to have a one thing. to say before you go. okay it is a [ __ ] travesty. is a [ __ ] shame we have somebody. who studied human development and it's [ __ ] loves being a preschool teacher. and would dedicate her entire life. to it if only she didn't. get paid like [ __ ] dog [ __ ] dude this is [ __ ] horseshit nobody disagrees with that man i well then why the [ __ ] is it way it is because it's too hard out there dude it's hot out here for a pound okay anyway go ahead the records or whatever um look it's we also live in a time where you can make money actually kind of doing nothing okay how would you suggest you do that look there's a ton of ways to. do it i don't want to. get into the weeds. of how you can do it. but dude you can start. something online and passively make income. it is very tough to. live the way you're living because of the paycheck you're getting. but you can go home i don't know. what you have at home. but you can go home and you can learn. ways to make money. just by sitting at home and uh you could start you know. some sort of a brand some sort of a a a a viral. thing you can do this. it takes time it's very hard. but you can do it. and you can get more income. that way you know you can. open up a shopify. account try and sell things. you could get them situated. on the amazon lists and all. that stuff and there's ways to. make more money i got an idea okay. so and then there's also only fans which i don't suggest. you do but like that's one. way you love your. job it's just it's paying you but it's not not. paying you enough find something. that you're really good at tip. jar at the preschool. oops so find something. that you're really good at and it. like set up some kind of shop. online or a way to. sell it online uh i don't know what that. would be it could be [ __ ] anything it could be flower arrangements it could be [ __ ] knitting it could be a graphic design i don't [ __ ] know but find the thing that you already have your passion now find the thing that you're good at and just try to. make like a little bit of extra. money at it and you will. [ __ ] the being the thing that you're really good at and the thing that you love doing will be this sort of like you'll have this sort of give and take life where yes you do the thing you love but it doesn't pay. you enough then you [ __ ] do the thing that you're really good at and make a little bit of extra. money that is the ideal i think for someone. like you i mean the ideal is actually get your ass. [ __ ] paid because you deserve it. but that's not gonna [ __ ] happen. uh so so what that's the that's the advice. though always when you're like i don't know what to. do whether it's trying. to find your passion or trying. to find a way. to make money figure out. the thing that you're really. really good at that you could that. you could be in a group. of people and be the best. at something and then figure out the way. that that skill can be can can. lead you to make money. the thing that you're the best. at is going to. be the thing that you make the money. at best most money in almost always yeah. yeah i guess so but i don't mean. like doing cartwheels. something you could possibly. monetize right cartwheel festival right. yeah put on a date. a bimonthly cargo festival i don't. know what to do uh so what. so what you suggest. like like what are things like obviously. singing or like something like that. or like uh making happen. make [ __ ] the best hats. dude yeah and even if you sell just like a few a month. that's money in the bank dude. that's an additional income. that is true make hats. dude and then stop what you're doing. and make hats worst. life coach dude did you go. did you go to. matalia yeah what did. he tell you to. make yeah that's what you told me. how many hot companies can there. be when you're the best. at it there can be a innumerable. amount of hot companies but you're only. the best if you're the one. but then a new one. comes and it's like oh you're the best. and then it's like oh i want that. kind of head not that kind of nobody's hungrier than the wolf. on the bottom okay well you know. that doesn't apply to. what uh it is true. if you're making hats and you're the top. dog all right that's great. you're at the top one. more one more what video okay. but i'm saying if you're at the top. okay and you're the wolf. at the top that's great. you're at the top but guess. who's hunger the wolf at the bottom okay. bye that's so rude. hi matt and chris this. is anthony i am 24. doing a monologue thank you. guys for this year. for carnegie mellon this. podcast and i've been a fan. of chris's and um i just like this. i feel like confess something. making a meal you two genuinely bring great. things into. people's lives damn it. uh i'm happy and are proud because i would be thank you. all right uh i had a question. about prioritization i am in a situation. right now where i have i have two companies and brian a girlfriend. who i plan to. propose to and uh i just don't have any time. ever i barely have weekends you know. to spend with her socks. is mostly working and i wanted. to know if you have any uh any tips. on dealing with the stress. or dealing with optimizing around. time thank you all right here's the thing. if you got a [ __ ] woman that you love and you're so busy polite. and you're so busy that you really have like very little time. to ever see her. you gotta make time dude. you've got to. make time because she'll [ __ ] leave you if that lasts too long and then you'll be like why did i [ __ ] you gotta you gotta not let that become an issue right you gotta make time for her you gotta sacrifice some things even if it's just one small thing a week that you sacrifice you gotta make those sacrifices dude because just like a [ __ ] plant dude you gotta have some water. you gotta get the sun and the love you. gotta [ __ ] give the plant. the son and love you can't. let it wither away. and not feed it. you gotta [ __ ] you gotta keep it moist. you gotta keep it nice. soft and moist and sunny and light. look at my plant still. no i don't remember what um uh yeah. you gotta you got two companies that's cool. balling out of control. but also not balling out. of control with you you. got to be bowling. out of control companies i get it. but if you don't make time. for your girl your girl's. gonna be balling out. of control and i don't mean. balling money i mean. balling crying right. wow so she could be balling out. of control because you're balling out. of control so you got to. get your balls kind of controlled. oh wow you can't be really out. of control you got to. be more balling in control. so your girl's not balling. at all right so we got to. get ballin in control. to make sure your girl is not balling at. all and that is the platform. i'm running on vote. for me so the easier way. to say that is just you got it. you've got to. make time for your girl. yeah you will regret it if you don't but sounds like you really. really love this woman obviously. you're going to propose. to her you're gonna propose. gotta [ __ ] make sure it's you gotta you gotta dedicate time dude. so just like anything else so matt. said obviously make time. for her if i'm gonna say it the easier. way the more memorable. way you're balling out of. control but pretty soon your girlfriend's. gonna be balling out. of control and i don't mean. balling with money i mean. balding crying right so you got to. be balling more in control. this way your woman is not bawling. at all and that's the way. to say it so you're just literally saying the same. exact thing that you just said. yeah because okay because you said it. the way where it's like make more time. for your girl but me i'm saying it. the important way which is your ball. in control and you shouldn't be you know and you gotta you. gotta make sure you're bowling. in control your girl's gonna. be balling out of control. and i don't mean bowling. with money i mean balling crying. so i got to. be more balling in control. so she won't be balling at all. stop do you know what i mean. just [ __ ] completely stop all right. that wraps up the episode. thank you all so much. if you want
