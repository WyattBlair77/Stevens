 [music] hey guys and welcome. to a super cult. production of congratulations [music] so it's back. we're back congratulations we are back. a week later and it's always a week. later when we do the thing it's back when we do the week. later it's back when we do a week later is when we you know what i'm saying dude. i don't want to. i want to. get to the point. in my life where i'm just saying all. the words in the sentence. and then you make the sentence. for me i think that would be amazing. dude like come on elon musk. what are you doing get it. so we can have things. in our head where you just throw you. know how we [ __ ] sentences up. all the time left. and right we'll be like it's it's it's it. you know we'll just do what i just said. right like sometimes you say yesterday. instead of tomorrow i need to. autocorrect for that come on elon musk. let's get it going dude. um you know but i don't know maybe i i don't take gabapentin. anymore so it's like it's not that but sometimes i need word i think it [ __ ] i need my word recall is getting worse yes. dude my word recall's. getting worse i'm getting older and i'm 42. right now and uh you know every time i say my age. i've been i think about i used. to be in this. art class i've never said this. before on my podcast. but i think about this kid. in this art class. i was like 10 in it. and then every time they asked somebody how old he was he said nine. going on ten and i always think about it because obviously ten. comes after nine and we all know it. do it people say nine going. on ten and then we have to. write in all of our information on. a thing that we passed around. and his and mine came to. me it went to. him first and mine came to. me it went to. his first see this would be one of those. times where you could just understand. what i'm saying uh it went. to him first and then i saw what he put in under age. and he wrote it. in the little box. nine going on ten and that's absolutely ridiculous. to write it we know. what comes next but he was insecure. about it and we're all insecure. about we're insecure about. you know whatever we're insecure. about there's nothing you can. do about it i mean. you can't go to. therapy and [ __ ] and i'm insecure. about being alone and i'm insecure. about who i am as a person. but it's all good dude. right we're all insecure about different. things some people are insecure. he's insecure about how he wants. to be perceived as more of a man. because he was also a little bit of a shrimp. boat for nine years. old and uh me i'm insecure. uh about uh being alone. right i'm insecure about that. okay uh we got dates. coming up washington d.c i will be there. saturday washington dc you go. to crystalia dot com. to get your tickets. then i

but then i googled it. those are the more poisonous. ones why because they need to. rely on poison not. their pincers a scorpion. filled with poison at my door. like it's a jehovah's witness at. my door like it's a hare. krishna at my door like it's a mormon. missionary at my door like it's selling. me girl scout cookies but it doesn't have all. that it doesn't have a white. button down with short sleeves and a tie. it doesn't have that orange. [ __ ] robe that they wear it doesn't have any of that. it just has a [ __ ] tail ready. to attack dude a scorpion. now i've been in los angeles. for 23 years that's a long. time okay 23 [ __ ] years. some people die before that. some people die before they're 23. i've lived. in los angeles a lifetime. that's what i'm telling you. dude i've seen a scorpion. one time and it was when i was just watching by. mistake scorpion king it's. the worst movie of all time. but i've never seen a scorpion. except for on youtube. or when i'm in arizona. i've seen scorpions okay. but there was a scorpion. in los angeles california. and i saw it and it was just chilling. at my doorway i got home. it was late at night they come out. at night because that's when you know. it gets hot dude it. wanted it indoors man and this even the scorpion. was like really nighttime come on. get the [ __ ] out of here. we're going in dude. it was ridiculous and i was scared. i was scared of [ __ ] dude. but guess what i did. i overcame it now whereas if it wasn't a spider. or a scorpion would. i have killed it. no if it was an ant even if it was a big. ant i would have probably shoot. it away i would have probably kicked. it right even if it was a b. i probably would have flicked. it like there was a b on calvin's. floaty the other day. and kristen says there's a b on it. you might want to. do something about it. now i wasn't worried because calvin's. been stung before and we know. he's not allergic so we're past. that [ __ ] he's two and a half. i took the b i lined. it up ping flicked it. out it hit the side. it was on the ground. for a little bit thought maybe i killed it. and then it just kind of walked away. right i think i probably ended up flying. i didn't kill it. okay that's my point. i'm very good with nature. and i'm nice with nature. okay i don't [ __ ] break. off branches and i try not to. kill bees unless they're around. write somebody that like if i didn't know kevin was allergic or not. and b was around i would kill. the bee right but a scorpion. dude so i looked at it. and i [ __ ] stomped it and i dragged it all in the house. when you dre when you man. it was like it was like i shot somebody there. was so much mess it. was like and and it was a mess. and then there was like its body was still there. like scraped it was like a [ __ ] i needed to. take cut like little [ __ ] spokes. and little caution tape for crime. scene and put the outline. of the scorpion with the [ __ ] white. little white tape with the little tail. scooped up you know. but dude it was uh it. was a menace man. it was at my door. knocking and then i [ __ ] killed it and i walk up and one of my friends. was over with kristen and i say hey i just killed. a scorpion and she says. really and i say yeah. and then i go to. kristen and i say i just killed the scorpion. and she said really and i will and i said yeah. she said where was i told her. where it was we saw the body. do it it was just like this. this is what the scorpion. was like this so anyway i googled it. and i was like okay. it wasn't a purple. you ever see a big. purple if i saw a big purple. one forget it dude. forget it first the spider's. in seattle and now this the scorpions big scorpions. they have armor and [ __ ] they look. like they belong in game. of thrones and uh and so i uh i killed. it and then i googled it. and it said you'll never see multiple scorpions. together like they're lone wolves. and i'm just like [ __ ] yeah dude maybe i'm like a scorpion. dude because that's kind of how i am. right i'm the scorpion. you know i don't really like to. [ __ ] with people because i don't trust them scorpions you know. what scorpions are like tupac. they're the tupac of the arachnids. they're like yeah but trust no one. that's what a scorpion's like and that's what i'm like you. see a little scorpion. with the two little pinchers and a [ __ ] backwards bandana tied like aunt jemima. but it's tupac with a [ __ ] chain. and a cross and a thing that says 50. scorpions on his chest. with a z that's me. dude i'm the lone scorpion. i don't [ __ ] with nobody dude. but i killed him it was either. me or my [ __ ] son getting sniped and hurt. you know [ __ ] scared to. see a scorpion for the first. time ever people think i'm lying. dude i'm like dude so anyway i killed a scorpion. i'm [ __ ] awesome if there was one of those blue ones i would have got a [ __ ] shield. god i don't like doing that. i don't like uh doing any of that. killing [ __ ] it makes me. feel bad a little bit i used. to i used to. think it was clever when i was a kid. people would be like i'd be like ask me. if i'm a killer and they'd be like are. you a killer and it'd be like yeah and they like you never killed. anyone i'd be like kill. dance and then i would [ __ ] walk away. like like that's so something. a nineyearold would do that would think would that thing. that that would think he's badass. there's too much [ __ ] on instagram i gotta get instagram's the only one i go on i do post on tick. tock and then i [ __ ] i don't ever really look at comments. and [ __ ] instagram's the only one where sometimes i'll catch a comment dude. right it's the only one and i watch it. and then i see like the kanye. west [ __ ] it just makes me sad. right like hey he's having a manic episode. hey somebody help that guy. hey guy yeah it's good. when people are like but it's good. for publicity it helps his pockets. yeah okay oh but he's probably releasing. an album or a documentary. yeah okay but what about. his mental what about how he's doxing everybody. at adidas right now just posting pictures of old white. dudes and jackie joyner kersey hey it's [ __ ] their lives up dude just posting all sorts of [ __ ] he says sometimes. i dress like it's winter when my house. outfit is hot sometimes i dress. like it's winter when it's hot. because my outfit hot i'ma sweat. before you catch me looking. regular at the bet awards. this n word that work at universal. asked me i was asked. me was i hot i told this. nword you work at universal. lol silliness also dude not even a bad job. well universal is a [ __ ] working at universal is good they got [ __ ] good dental right like you got [ __ ] health insurance this is a [ __ ] job everybody would want and this guy's like also how about how aren't you hot isn't even a snake this aren't you hot it's just oh man are you sure you wanna are you hot are you sweating didn't [ __ ] uh uh martin lawrence collapsed cause he was wearing too many layers this guy could have just been [ __ ] concerned and this guy goes and then kanye says you work at universal ha ha. siddiq so dick wasn't even. remotely shitty are you hot. you work at universal [ __ ] face oh oh okay and then people are putting out there. about how like kanye. there he goes again. and it helps his ticket. sales and it helps albums or whatever. the [ __ ] this guy's losing his mind. dude and then he said he was gonna go to. the weekend concert. and that's what i call. him the weakened because there's no e. it's the weakened if that's what he wants. to spell it that's how we're all saying. it dude the weakened so he went to. the wiccan concert and dude. and he was saying how there was going. to be no security. find me if you want to. find me dude this guy's going. to get [ __ ] this guy's going to. get his wig pushed back. dude [ __ ] man i want to. get a bulletproof vest. i really do and i want to. do my shows like the [ __ ] tupac. comedian that's what i want to. do and kristen said don't get a bulletproof. vest and i said dude. i get death threats and she's. like i know but it seems like you're egging them. on and i go all right. well you know if i do get shot in the chest. then what you're going. to wish i got a [ __ ] you know i wish i got something you're going to. wish i got something with no. sleeves in me and black dude. you're going to wish i got something. vinyl with no sleeves. on man i rocked. the [ __ ] out of that. put over a [ __ ] tshirt look ill [ __ ] i don't know man i'm just sad for kanye honestly man i know it seems like he has it all but dude that guy's got [ __ ] he's out what's up with the yes man dude help him out take some [ __ ] cbd dude take some cbd smoke. some weed i don't know. man i just feel bad. dude i really do feel bad. i want kanye to. be okay i want everybody. at adidas to be okay. you know dachshund people online. isn't cool i think that uh we need to.

to. push me though baby busy bone. wants he wants smoke. and it's fine and look here's the thing. dude i was a big fan. of bone dogs and harmony. way back when and i think i talked let me just let's break. down this where's this. video dude let's get this. video i may have to. cut because i need to. get this video and [ __ ] of course one fire. send me a video of a car. video this works on the thing. okay let me get it. why did it start. with a car did i click the wrong. thing let me do it. right now you're going to. want to hear this. pardon me dude as he said. to me part of my [ __ ] interruption. you're going to want. to hear this dude. oh i don't know why. it had a different thing. here we go all right. dude here it is. bone thugs in harmony. member busy bone so here's the deal. i told a story on the [ __ ] podcast a while ago. and it was about how i was at the comedy. store with my brother and faison. love all right you might know him from friday we were hanging out. talking and in the middle. of the conversation busy bone. walks up to us and wants to. say something to. faison love now he says pardon my [ __ ] pardon the interruption. pardon the interruption didn't need. all that we were like what. the [ __ ] is going on yelling. and screaming poured in the interruption. pardon the [ __ ] interruption. pardon my [ __ ] interrupts he kept saying it must have said it. 12 times told the story in the podcast. said he didn't need to. interrupt that art didn't know what it. was i hope that he's all. good wanted to talk. to faison love talked to. face on love a little bit walked. away and that was my whole. experience with busy bone all right. now it was on some hypno hiphop news. outlets for a little bit and it. said crystalia talks about busy. bone of course the media. ran with it like crystalline. is talking [ __ ] about busy. bone but that's what happened. don't know what busy bones. saw don't know how he took it because again. not oh mentally there. who is though not me. who is though no hate. on busy bone think he's very talented. in 1999 and that's fine. all right the one issue i had with both. dogs and harmony is everyone was they had 95 songs. about how everyone was trying. to rip bone thugs and. harmony off and these bone. clones were out there. trying to [ __ ] jack their style when it's like huh. there was nobody like them. and there never was and that's why. they were [ __ ] awesome for three years. and then weren't now no hate. there's still bone [ __ ] out. there that want to. be out there and be like you know i mean. dude honestly when they said asan giving up. for chatter for cheesy food. got it i felt that [ __ ] dude. right when they said it i'm giving it up. for easy for god's got it. i'm gonna miss everybody and now that's when i was sat. back and i was like you know what these lyrics. actually mean something to. me so say what you want. they got a fan base. and i'm all for it. dude but like i say in the hat. don't push me i said what. i said cause it. happened with no hate but he wanted. to pardon the interruption. and he did and we let him. talk to face on love. don't know what he said. because after that i was astonished and my brother. and i were looking at each other. like wow and i said is that. busy bone and my brother. said yeah and i said that's crazy. so now busy bone goes on this. [ __ ] thing streams live and starts. talking [ __ ] about yours. truly me and now as a 19. year old when i was listening. to [ __ ] bone thugs and harmony. listening i'm going to. miss everybody on

[ __ ] up the world and it's bad now i know because i'm a smart person that that's bad. okay but this this was great. there was a guy a black guy watering i mean. not great but there was a black guy. watering his neighbor's plants. because of the the the neighbors left. town and they wanted this. dude to look after the plants. and he came over and was watering the plants. for the people and someone a warm late spring. evening in the small alabama town of childersburg police are responding. to a 911 i mean. this guy's a voice dude. have you ever heard i was by. the way this voice that people a black pastor arrested. while watering neighbors flowers he was supposed. to be doing it but someone called. of suspicious behavior and dude. like that's always the voice. you know it's either that or like this. is how it is in sports. events dude have you ever seen a sporting event. where the guys don't talk. like that i have college. college football i watch college. football i watch the seminals versus the [ __ ] uh i don't know. who cares who cares. really but i watched them. and this and they were just dudes that were like oh man. whoa whoa oh wow. threw it over there whoa that's crazy. oh look at that oh yeah. it's a touchdown hey all right. he got a touchdown it was not of this. stuff and it was so [ __ ] weird dude. you got to have the voice. this is the voice we're all accustomed to. have the voice my neighbor. reporting she sees a young black male in the car. she doesn't recognize at her. neighbor's home who she knows are away. we're watching the police body cam. footage what officers find is a man. holding a garden hose watering. flowers intimidating it's so great all right. been black his whole life. just absolutely knows what's about. to go down you know. what i'm talking about dude. imagine black people doing this. [ __ ] and doing nothing at all and then the cops show up and they're just like here the [ __ ] we goddamn go again. dude this guy couldn't be doing something. more peaceful even if he is at a stranger's house. he's still helping he's watering the plants. it's hot out even if it is a suspicious. person dude if i if i walk out if i'm if i peek outside someone's watering my plants. i don't give a [ __ ] who they are i don't say nothing. i let them finish up. and leave then i don't have to. do it are they saying that. is that your vehicle. it's not it's the neighbors. the neighbors okay you live here. no i don't even okay. uh they saying that this. vehicle is not supposed to. be here and you're not supposed. to be here they called. about it i don't know. who caught i'm supposed to. be here i'm pastor jennings. i live across the street. dude he's a pastor of all couldn't be more innocent. dude couldn't be more innocent. just nah nah nah uh uh that's cute. man i'm supposed to. be here just start spraying like. just knows what's up oh you're gonna be racist. okay i'm pastor [ __ ] the subdued gotcha in his voice. oh no i'm supposed to. be here i'm pastor without looking. and spraying is so the [ __ ] dude what's saying i'm not supposed. to be here no i'm supposed. to be here i'm a pastor you're pastor jenny yes i'm looking out. for their house while they go. the scene quickly escalates when police demand 56 year. old michael jennings a pastor of 31. years provide some. identification look man don't do this. to me there's a suspicious. person in the yard and if you're not wanting to. identify yourself i don't have to. identify myself still spraying. if i ain't did nothing suspicious. i nothing wrong moments. later when jennings attempts to. use his cell phone he's placed. in handcuffs who called y'all. i don't have the idea. you will not listen. i have a call on you. all right i don't know what you know. i get i get like comply i get it. i get that like cops. can do whatever they really. can do whatever they want. it's like you have no right. it's used for you to. say to a cop. you have no right to. do this they get you on. something you know like they i get it. but for having to. deal with this [ __ ] their whole lives i under i also understand that look [ __ ] i'm not doing anything people are out there robbing and stealing and [ __ ] let me just water these goddamn plants. because i'm black you [ __ ] i was called. obviously what like why what where's what i don't. get about and i support. the i'm not one of these [ __ ] that's like [ __ ] defund the police i think that's utterly. [ __ ] idiotic we need. police the crime in la. sucks because they don't have enough. the police don't have enough money. because [ __ ] we're we're cucks you know what i'm saying. is too liberal all. right so by no means am i saying. oh defund the police [ __ ] the police [ __ ] all cop. nah i the we need them. okay i want all the cops. i want more cops all right. but i don't understand. why when a cop. shows up to this house and sees what's actually happened. they don't say oh i get what's happening. it's racism ah racism. again the only thing that i can. understand is is that the cops. are racist and maybe they are maybe they are but they're not. racist cause they're cops people. have all sorts of different. levels of racism you know. and i think that it's kind of like i said we're tribal. and if you want to. be 80 an asian and only hang out with asian people. that's the amount on racism. that's totally down but 300 000 racism. this is how much it. is this is beyond. this is 300 000 racist that's what that. is i don't know why. cops don't show up and they say oh he's watering oh yeah. the [ __ ] chick she was probably white let's go [ __ ] talk to. her because then they're like well why. don't you show us the identification we have to. arrest you if you don't and then the black guy is like well i shouldn't have to. do that just because i'm black and you get the thing. and i get it let it go. dude let it go let it go that's what the [ __ ] disney. song's about racism secretly. homie no we let it go. let it go let it go i i don't know. what anything is anymore. honestly i see j cole. on the [ __ ] nba 2k. cover and i'm just like what how how long do. we have to pretend that j. cole is [ __ ] good about this is the thing remember the [ __ ] uh master p how he was kind of good at basketball and [ __ ] and there was that rumor that hanging with mr cooper almost made it on the [ __ ] hornets. or whatever the hell it. was i don't care about those. and people are like yeah j cole's. actually good all right. you know not re okay. okay and now he's on the cover. of [ __ ] nba 2k that'd be. like a [ __ ] guy fieri was. on the cover of this.
