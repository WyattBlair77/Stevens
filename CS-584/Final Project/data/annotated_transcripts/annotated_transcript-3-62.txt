[music] did you see. the christian bale playing the thor guy. and he looks like he shouldn't i i did. see that and dude. they'd show a christian bail. we'll put it on the video. but we showed christian. bale playing i guess his name is gore. the god butcher sadarke on the new thor. movie but he the picture that they showed him. he's like this he's got diarrhea. he's constantly looks like he's [ __ ] and it's it's crazy. to be a god butcher and still be and look like you're [ __ ] i think all that god butching makes you constipated. yeah so he's like yeah. killing too many gods. lately yeah dude why do the most like acclaimed actors do marvel [ __ ] well i i don't know small roles in marvel shows. yeah i know you know. he should they shot him. out in like four days i think that probably well money right. it's money but it's like dude. you ha your christian bail you have enough money i guess so but wouldn't i think people just are like no i don't want to. do it until then it's like well we'll give you 20. million and he's like all right. [ __ ] it it's a week like why wouldn't you do it like why wouldn't you do it i don't know you'd think some people would care more about legacy. than than just people yeah. but nobody's gonna remember him. as that guy they're going. to remember christian bell. the great [ __ ] actor they're not going to. think they're not going to. be like and let's not forget. he played gore the butcher dude. i would go the way. things are going i wouldn't be surprised. and then even still then he wants. to [ __ ] solidify his legacy. that way too right. okay so now i'm pissed though. i mean i'm on your side. dude are you okay well i mean what's your argument you don't like marvel. movies you think that they're bad. and then so you think that when a like a good actor does it. my arnold my argument is when a really like jessica. chastain did it too in one. of the xmen movies she's like tiny. role yeah in like a spinoff. of an xmen movie yeah and it's like what. are you doing why are you doing. that and i guess in her case. she probably doesn't make as much money. as a guy who was batman. in four movies right. movies whatever oh you're saying he was batman. yeah he was already [ __ ] batman. three times but he thought but you have to. understand christian bale is probably like this. guy that thinks that oh i'm gonna do batman. i'm gonna be batman but it's gonna be an artistic. version christopher nolan has [ __ ] convinced me. and then he's doing it. you know and he thinks it's good. and a lot of people think it's good. and whether or not you and i think it's good. then it you know it's all subjective. anyway so they're rationalizing also it's [ __ ] actors are ego driven. he also loves the franchise. [ __ ] he was doing terminator that's when he when he made that tape. yeah yeah good for you. that one yeah oh good for you. and how was it busting. and so mad that a guy. [ __ ] had an orgasm first and no you're not gonna get to. have it i was it. dude yeah that's that was that's given. me more joy than almost that. thing was really funny good. for you yeah that's not what's the thing. where he's like no but when he says he did. something like ah that's not all. right that's not how it is right. or something what's the [ __ ] thing it's not nobody does something like very like casual in it that's not what it is yeah i forgot yeah yeah but the elephant. in the other in the room. is yeah i got this. new [ __ ] hoodie on oh see i wasn't even noticing it but

have you been having fun. doing this show i've been having a lot. of fun i've been looking a lot. forward to it and i'll tell you what i've been looking did. you want my answer did. you just want to. talk well you breathed and you. took too long. right the breathing doesn't is not taking too. long it's just breathing okay. but the answer is yes i've been having fun. after after every episode i always think wow that. was so fun that what i just said. sounded like i was lying. worse playback i absolutely was. not lying um i do too and i guess. what and this is how you really know. the test of how fun this. podcast is okay okay and by the way share the podcast if you like the podcast leave a comment oh and give advice to. the people that we give advice to. in the comments because they're checking they're checking they are actually. yeah and they respond. to you guys i've seen it. but um what what i was gonna say. is i like to. drive i even get excited there's sometimes there's so much traffic. in l.a oh yeah yeah and i still you know. i drive and i hate the traffic. but i'm excited to. get here and what does. he do he stops at the coffee. bean and tea leaf. and today you weren't even. late i wasn't late i thought i gave myself. time i gave myself a lot. of time to. make it and there was zero. traffic that's the thing about la. you never know if there's gonna be traffic or not but giving yourself. a lot of time is exactly. how one remains on. time see what i'm saying you. don't get extra credit. for giving yourself a lot. of time that's what you're supposed. to do when traffic is inevitable. and in la it is inevitable. right but we work with our. circumstances and we grow with them. right so when i leave and then i'm late because the traffic is too bad. and then i leave and then i'm late because the traffic is too bad. then i give myself. extra time and then i'm 40. minutes early now that's too. much so the next time. i might be like well maybe i don't need to. leave so early but you do but then i'm 40. minutes early again maybe maybe but that's better. than being 40 minutes late. 40 minutes early is better. than being 40 minutes late. yes yes only pretty much for the people that aren't you. yeah which is ideal we're more. important yeah we get it. but the people who aren't you are the reason. we try to. be on time yeah otherwise you get. if it's just you going somewhere. you get there whenever the [ __ ] you want true. get there whenever the [ __ ] you get there i got coffee. being a tea leaf. on the guy and then this guy goes like this. hey man dude can i get a picture. with you and i say sure. and he said i was gonna yell out. from across the room but this isn't the hood oh and i said oh yeah and he said yeah. so i had to. keep it really nice and then he takes out. his phone and it was one. of those phones that you fold. out like a laser disk. dude and he's going like this. and it's so big right. that it's almost like dipping. and he has to. use his other kind of phone. bro i don't know these guys from the future. the hood in the future. and he goes like this. and he and he just and and he couldn't even like the button was so far. over that he could barely and he hit it. and he was like shaking and he's like bro. that's so [ __ ] awesome man thank you for what. you do and i was like all right. cool and then i left. with the iced americano. and i got in the car. and then somebody was walking by i didn't know. if it was a man. or a woman oh okay. but that's fine right. that is fine but also such a bad. ending in that event absolutely nothing. to do with what preceded. it you know oh [ __ ] nothing to. do with it it's all good. uh do you want to. go do you want to. start yeah okay cool. let's do it hey guys this. is kirsten from jersey um hell yeah. new jersey we're from jersey. we like anyway so i have a hard. hitting question for you guys. we how do you feel about. phone calls just literally picking up. the phone hey what's up. i personally love it i think it's a great way to. communicate with your friends chat say what's up. well literally none of my friends. answer my phone calls like and then in the next breath. they'll text me like oh hey what's up. mmhmm yeah like [ __ ] i would have told you if you would've yeah yeah so yeah i'm just like i'm wondering if is it just like an invasion of privacy. like should i text you first like why. does everyone feel like it's so invasive. to call someone or pick up. the phone yeah just asking you know. for me really anyway yeah. it's so sometimes personal like dude. text everyone text you know. like even mom is like yeah. what's up yeah yeah right. uh but it's so and like you have you been texting. with someone and then they call and you're like oh [ __ ] they know i'm looking that's the only unfair. move it's unfair. dude it's unfair the thing. the thing that she's talking. about though is i actually agree. with her i wonder why everyone is. so afraid oops i'm talking because i don't want to. and you only do it. while i'm talking i know. but i will be ready. to do what i'm talking for. me all right okay so but when you call it. out no one's hearing this. when you call it. i'm hearing it okay. so i'm hearing it. all right and she is right. in that it's annoying that people are like this. now people do basically whatever they can to. not have to get on the phone. right that is annoying and and also i do that. yes so i'm of both. minds i do that too. i wait it's annoying. no it's i think i don't call. me never call me. see i don't like that rule. but i feel that way. but i don't like that i'm like that. i have honestly uh cancelled. a call and texted the person. no what's up yeah that's unbelievable. i'm real it's unbelievably rude. it's not though if you have the dynamic. of that sure if you have a certain friend. that would find that funny. yeah because i could find it. it's funny or you're not. in my camp okay do you understand. so militant about no. funny camp what's up what do. you want to. know nothing is worth a phone call. i don't know i i don't like picking up. either and i'll often let it ring but i find that. me being like that and other people being like that i find that. [ __ ] frustrating i do. times are changing though and you know and pretty soon. it's going to. be like don't text me. dude just think it. and send it over through. the thought link i'll get it. right but until that. is the case right. texting is the thing we got to. figure out a way to. coexist you think that back in like the [ __ ] 1200s people were like another [ __ ] pigeon with a note on it it's so personal maybe letters they were like that with um let's talk about how jersey that girl was though but then after she said it and and then she started talking more i thought that is such a jersey yeah yeah uhhuh it's so jersey to. be subtly jersey yeah that's you know. what i'm talking about like the people. who are like listen. i talk to them. all day you know that's that's like the 80s. 90s type jerseys. exist yeah sure this this woman is like the new age. subtly jersey most jersed out [ __ ] i've ever seen i mean yeah she's jersed out so um you know i think that honestly maybe they're just like not picking up the phone call because they're like i'm not this jersey like she's probably calling other people from jersey and just text she probably texts people with the fingernail emojis you know super jersed out but she's uh yeah she's you know i have friends that like to. talk like who i have a buddy. who [ __ ] calls me all the time. and it's just dude. there's one possibility that we haven't considered. which is that she's basically saying why. does nobody pick up my. phone calls mmhmm and you're saying it's maybe on her. maybe yeah but i don't i don't think so but maybe yeah i don't know. she seems like nice and [ __ ] and like but but like and also like i i really like a lot. of people i like when they come over i like when they're in my lives. and like when they're talking but when when they call me. i'm like come on man. i don't like being called. what's worse face time's worse. right because you gotta people are like i like to. facetime why don't we facetime. and it's like dude i don't how about this. it's worse than phone. call because not only do you have to. um not text and be c. conscious of only the phone call. you also got to. hold your [ __ ] arm up yeah yeah and it's like i'm strong obviously my [ __ ] you know it. goes dummy right like a lot of people if they see me from the back. there's no way they can. tell who it is because it looks like i'm wearing. a shield oh okay. like just at cat at. bay right in case. [ __ ] goes down yeah because of my back's lumped. up but like when i [ __ ] i'm holding it like this. i still get tired i'm a. human right okay but i also think there's more cars. more frustrating than an unsolicited facetime. if we're supposed to. facetime at a certain time or if you text. me hey let's facetime. and i say okay. great but if you just [ __ ] facetime. me wow so [ __ ] gotta empty it out. i'll tell you what got to. get this down dousia okay. i tell you what the number one. people who face time in public. [music] oh i and i will say this. here we go and i'm going. to say it i'm going. to say this first so it doesn't sound. racist white chicks do you understand. so far so far not racist. because i'm white okay also tied with black dudes oh really dudes it's like they want you to. hear that they have friends. and see they have friends. sup and for some reason. that [ __ ] loom is louder on a black dude's phone it's just like what's up yo what are you doing chilling. bee chilling i don't see it yeah that's the other guy i don't see it a lot just like what's going on here in a diner facetiming in public is just a nono i think yeah general [ __ ] dude that's my nightmare that's my yeah yeah it's so it's so annoying. dude yeah no good but the phone. call thing i mean look it's like change with the times if you can't. beat them join them i think you need to. result in text i think she needs. to understand her friends are not going to. want to be calling and you just or get a group. of friends that are like oldfashioned. she's oldfashioned she's trapped in a young person's body she's old that's true. yeah right yeah you know. so you're saying she should get with the times. and just text get with the times. and just text or get a lot. of oldfashioned friends or just older friends. maybe there's a solution. where it's like hey can we hop on. the phone you text that first and you might get on the phone. oh oh heartbeat city dude what i mean. [ __ ] anxiety dude hey can you talk do you want to. hop on the phone you might as well. just [ __ ] you know in the uh you might as well just inject me. with that thing in the rock. when to fight oh the adrenaline rule. the adrenaline dude i [ __ ] i can't stand. that hey can you chat. oh my god dude i want a part. of you say something different. then not hey can you chat. everything's totally fine saying like yeah right. yeah just want to. [ __ ] with you yes yeah right okay that's fine yeah okay that's so specific but yeah i mean it's better. to be specific when hey can you chat. is like oh [ __ ] what what did. i do but i sounds like she has a problem with that. kind of person that only wants. to text but the truth. is if all your friends. are like that you got to. get on board there's no way. to make them want to. talk on the phone that's only going. to alienate them if you can't beat them. join them one time i was driving. uh along the 110 freeway and i saw and where you get onto. the five freeway yeah there's that. one lane that you gotta merge. on and everyone was lined. up so long and i went i used to. go wait to. uh get in the back because i thought it's respectful. to wait your turn in line. and that as i was doing that. i was waiting in the back. this is dude i changed this. day i changed i was waiting. in the line and i saw everybody. cutting in everybody cutting in now i don't like to. do that because i'm respectful. especially when it comes to. a [ __ ] line dude i don't cut lines yeah. okay right yeah and i've been cut before. yeah but whatever dude i keep my side. of the street clean yeah. i'm waiting in line. i see people cutting in dude. it takes me [ __ ] an extra 10 minutes. to merge onto the. five freeway so i adopted if you can't. beat em join them and now i cut as early as i can dude now just in general i'll crash oh yeah oh you're gonna crash into. me no you won't so i [ __ ] get in you can't beat them join them. i cut dude i cut on that. five freeway entrance so. if you can't join what you're saying. every single time so see if we're not if we're not all playing by the rules. pandemonium baby yeah but see you've changed you you i've noticed that you change your rules. based on the way. other people are behaving and i never do. that and i'm better what it. means is i'm better. because i have hard principles. i have heard you're flimsy. flappy all over the place. moving your [ __ ] around i am. the way i am in the face. of whatever you agree great. you disagree great you. know what it is all the same. to me i'm a chameleon. and that's what makes me. such a great actor as well is that. what which is what you're basically. that's not even at all what. i'm saying i know but you could agree with. that oh well i think you're a great. actor but that doesn't again. nothing to do with what i said. thank you just just just in general. across the board nothing all. right we'll do another one. we definitely figured that out. yeah let's do another one. we spent too much time. on that but i like what we spent too. much it right time. okay go ahead let's do another. one chilling oh just wait. [ __ ] pause it absolutely passed out. was so drunk woke up had his phone. and he was like lifeline. and then [ __ ] just recorded alright guys a fireman christmas oh yeah love the podcast traveling through bc. doesn't matter [ __ ] where the question is is that um i dated a girl in 2019. she's a cam model uh she asked. me in the video only one i ever did. got screen recorded and now it's online. somewhere whoa um i don't know what to. do now it's gonna be there. forever yeah just own. this grow a mustache. get in the business no. no uh second thing is i'm five eight. i have along here no it's not. doesn't [ __ ] matter yeah i know maybe he meant more of a handlebar mustache. also bro where are you he was like on a boat it. was like he was on. a boat where like. they hung up some plants. yeah in this one. window area yeah and he like stuck. himself in that little wedged into. that little area i mean. was he just sleeping and then woke. up and was like god or was he like ooh that's a good [ __ ] tight spot. to do this video yeah what i wonder also why well he takes a lot. of weird videos right. that guy yeah because he did yeah. he's not good at taking videos. of himself he said. only fans or a cam. model right yeah or something. so he did a video. with her yeah i guess is what he said says one. and and it's online. and she put it online. it's just so [ __ ] isn't there such thing as like uh revenge porn can't. you know like it's illegal. yeah i i think it. is i don't know it's illegal. but i also think that it. doesn't it's like so hard. to process you it's also um vancouver or uh sorry. canada so who knows what the [ __ ] right the laws are there yeah um but definitely this isn't one of those situations. that you where you go. okay all in i'm a porn actor yeah. no that's not a good. thing it's not because porn star is. one of those things that like is thrown. around like you you'll be like yo she's a porn. star and you're like really and she did three videos. and it's like dude right. you gotta work for that. star thing people just mean act like someone who was in porn. you know like once even they'll say a porn. star i find that weird. too i mean i think that that. guy just basically you know. you gotta just own. it and be like yeah i did. it and she [ __ ] put it out didn't mean for it to. but how about the way i lay it. down right how about the way. i do the horizontal mambo. he doesn't have options he doesn't have options. yeah he well what do. you mean like he's asking for advice. and there's no advice to. give all i can say. is that sucks right. i mean yeah you're not gonna be like well it. leaked now i'm a porn star that's not a [ __ ] option that's just like a change in there is this path. yeah there is this sort of thing. in the world that exists. now though where it's just like lean. into whatever the [ __ ] you think people think you are you know especially social media. wise like everyone's got a presence. digitally and trump kind of made it. so it's like all right. i'm the guy who you hate. but i'm the [ __ ] i'm gonna tell it like it is and i got my fan base who [ __ ] believes in me ride. or die so that guy. is basically um riding this trump. effect where it's like look she put out a video maybe i'm just a porn star now. and [ __ ] everybody i think that's a bad thing though i think you're not he's not a portrait he's just in some cam. girl right video right. right you can't just be like well i was an extra in the latest mel. gibson movie should i just lean. into this and become a movie. star yeah it's just like start. taking pictures and autographs like just it's not. like you snap your fingers and suddenly you are the [ __ ] thing um i saw a building i'm an architect yeah yeah yeah so basically all this guy did was call in to. brag that he [ __ ] somebody on camera yeah also the guy doesn't want people to. know he's [ __ ] letting people know yeah what the [ __ ] lifelong. this is on a [ __ ] lifeline it's got you know millions and trillions of views. i know i don't buy this. guy at all yeah you know what dude. you're a faker bro he's a faker there. might not even be a video.

news customer living for about a year. um pursuing my acting career now. that i've gotten a little more. comfortable in that arena and i've found my footing in that. i'd like to branch. out and do standup which i've wanted to. do forever but my hometown didn't really have any open. mic places or open mic. places that allowed uh children. under the age of 21. um now. that i got the fake i'm going. up and i'm doing a three minute. set tonight in about an hour. um i know these questions are going. to answer late or not. at all but i'll make it quick. i have a question. for chris and for matt for chris. is there anything in your career. that you realized years into. it years of doing stand. up that you wish you knew. just a little bit sooner to. make things easier for you. if you knew it just a couple. years prior maybe you would have been able. to find your flow better. or something maybe save me a couple. years of trial and error anyways. for matt you're hilarious i've seen. your podcast i've seen you on. chris's podcast and now i get to. see you guys next to. each other weekly i couldn't be more happy. that being the case. you've got to. have about 15 minutes. or something man i want to. see you do stand. up even though it's not your adventure you ever. think about doing it. just for shits and giggles. anyways all right i'm gonna go. put up my set i'm gonna go. eat [ __ ] thanks guys i mean that guy gives the micro machines guy. a run for his money. but so fast that was i mean. he makes vince vaughn. sound seem like gandhi dude. so fast the way he was speaking. and props to you for that. that was that's gonna happen. yeah um you started at. the right time he's starting. when he wants to. he's starting when he's young enough. uh that's a what a good. question that was what a good. ques i gotta say what a good. question that was for this. dude to to. be so aware of his. situation that that's the question. yes is is there anything. that you would have done. differently because a lot. of young comedians will come up. to me and say what do i do. to make it or um do. you have any advice and you know. a guy asked me. the other day and i said how long have you been doing. stand up and he said like two months. and i said there is no advice. you have to. the only advice is go on stage. as much as possible. but i knew that back then. i went on stage. as much as possible. i would do two three fours. five shows a night in los. angeles i was driving all. over creation going really you know. uh going from spot to. spot i am i'm gonna be late i'm [ __ ] this and that doing the open. mics so you know he didn't ask for this kind of advice. but you gotta go up. as much as possible. um the he said what would i have. done differently i don't know what i would. have done differently. you know i mean i had like my trajectory was pretty. quick so i you know i differently. would have maybe made it take longer. whatever uh i i i think just if you just do. as many shows as possible. don't ever ask to. be on shows um which i never did. anyway like people just kind of what would i have. done differently okay here's something i would have done. differently don't post your material. don't post your material. early on it's bad you're bad. and it's not your fault. i was bad too i got stuff. quick but i was still bad. you have to. like now i'm a much better. comic than i was [ __ ] 10 years ago. obviously because i've been working way. more and way harder but um but yeah i think that uh don't post. your stuff you're gonna want to. you're gonna want to. be that [ __ ] crowdwork tick. tock guy that gets [ __ ] people to. come you want it gonna be a comedy. more than anything is in the arts. is a marathon it's not. a [ __ ] sprint and i've always [ __ ] asked you why don't you stand up and the reason is matt hates [ __ ] stand up yeah i'm not in stand up um i never really was i there's there are people who do stand up that i'm like wow they're [ __ ] so great there are a lot of those people actually and if i'm if i go to. a show i will laugh and enjoy yeah. he's not sitting there no that being said it's never a thing. i want to. go to i want to. put on the tv if i'm going. to sit down and put something on i want. it to be a movie i don't want. to [ __ ] watch some person. unless i'm a huge fan of theirs. like i'll [ __ ] i'll put on [ __ ] chris rock special or some [ __ ] uh obviously i've been to. your shows a lot and enjoyed myself. yeah but also directed my last special. so and i yeah and i don't i don't not enjoy. it when i'm there. but it's just zero percent. of my you have to. be a fan of the person. really it's not that's right. stand up isn't even also you um you were like when i first started doing stand. up i was like why. don't you do it or something. and you were like what do. you got to do. to just like hang out like every night and i said yeah. and he was like you're like i don't want to. do that i don't want to. do that at all yeah so yeah. i get that you're a [ __ ] you're a you're a hermit a bit. i am a little bit. of a hermit yeah. and i'm it's too bad. too because you have excellent. shirts to show yeah i mean. now that i have this. podcast though i don't need to. socialize it's true sit at home. until i do this every [ __ ] week but yeah that's the reason. he's doing three minutes huh. i wonder what he might be doing the comedy. story if he's in he could really hack. it in he could get like six minutes. worth because he talks so [ __ ] yeah true yeah the guy could do his half. hour special in three minutes another thing. about cell phones um yeah have you seen. the news today uh good. luck dude it already happened but good luck and keep going that's cool. man i love it let's see. your next one hey guys so i recently. broke up with someone. and found myself in a new relationship. two weeks later i'm currently. in that relationship i'm very happy. with my decision however i can't. help but feel a little bit guilty for. maybe moving on too fast. i just want to. know your guys thoughts on moving. on from a relationship and um if there's an appropriate. time that you should weigh before. moving on thanks guys no. the answer is absolutely not. there's no appropriate amount of time. you're supposed to. wait yes yeah do what you want. yeah she's doing what she wants. dude she's living that hedonistic. lifestyle you know she still looks like somebody. from toronto can't believe she's not but she could be living in toronto. yeah but i i sensed though. she thought she was from there. what i sensed was yeah. she was foreign and i was right. so i went no no no no you can't. do that well you're usually american. and i want to. see that you can't see. that you're wrong and then scoot. into rightness that's my whole life. yeah i know and you're scooting into. rightness my whole life i'm here. to tell you you cannot. scoot into rightness anymore. those days are over i'm here to. put a stop put a halt to. your scoot and into. rightness gore the god butcher and i'm thor. um it's constipated you're scooting into. rightness um i'm here to. put a stop into. your scoring the answer is no. you met someone you fall. in love with them that's it. doesn't matter if it takes seven years. or seven days after you broke. up from your previous relationship. it doesn't [ __ ] matter it doesn't matter you do what you do and don't listen to. other people that are like you. know you should take a little more. time does it even mean. if she's not ready then she wouldn't be dating a [ __ ] new person. i guess so yeah or she's just a sociopath. and doesn't [ __ ] love anybody and just [ __ ] you know what i mean and then even more than don't wait. yeah true just break harshness go. just go yeah um yeah you don't wait. i mean it sucks. for the other guy i guess. if he like loved you and [ __ ] also like how long did you go out. with the person i don't know there's no rule. man like what's too long. anyway what's too short anyway. you don't know right. you'd ask somebody and they'd give you like. somebody would say three months. somebody would say one month. somebody would say a year. so it's like it's not up. to it's one of those things. that just whatever dude when i i used. to say this a lot. of my podcasts hedonistic lifestyle. and of course i don't mean. just go and do whatever. you want if we're going to. be real but also you got to. live what feels right. to you and if you're living what feels right. to you then you are what john lennon said. living i don't know he doesn't even. know i only got only got to. living he said something. like a [ __ ] a day of uh jesus. living i don't remember what he said. but john whatever he was shot. in the head so maybe it was wrong. he wasn't living totally right. because he died way. early but what i'm saying. is man and yoko ono really. like seems like she would be really. annoying to hang out with her. nah i didn't watch the new. beatles doc and so everybody's. mad at me for that but apparently she really wasn't in [ __ ] anything up she was just hanging out everybody would blame her for breaking up the beatles and apparently in peter jackson's new documentary in the truth appears to. be that she actually was just sort of like hanging out. and was escaping peter jackson the guy. who did lord of the rings. yeah you didn't know he made that. i know he did lord. of the rings no you didn't know. he made the new beatles. thing i didn't even know. there was a new beatles. thing what the [ __ ] do you know why though beetles are terrible. that's not the point it. was like a cultural moment. like a like a like a big deal. not just in the music. world but in like the world was the beatles. you didn't know no i know the beatles. but i wasn't it's called. get back get back the beatles. what the [ __ ] are you talking about it's called get back. there it's getting back the documentary. when did it come out. um anthony was that last year. it doesn't yeah oh okay. so recently yeah very recently. um i don't know man. but what i'm saying is yoko ono seemed annoying. just by kind of like looking at how she handled herself. but let's get back to. the [ __ ] thing here okay let's get back. to the thing what was the thing. the thing is a day. it's something like if you're living a day. of pleasure it's not wasted. or something because you're doing what you want. right and you're you're having a good. time here's the thing you didn't need. john lennon because that's such a vague. general thing to say you. could have just said it's not. a waste of time. if you're enjoying yourself that's my quote that's i think that's almost exactly. what john lennon is. okay well me and him. i guess are similar. but the point is you didn't need. to take 30 minutes. to try to. come up with a quote when you could have just said it. in your own words plainly. it also could have been one. of those things where it was like you. know how everyone's like will smith. said this or chris. hemsworth said this and it's like. shows a [ __ ] picture of him in the hot tub. and it's like and then will smith. is probably looking at this. [ __ ] like i didn't say that. chris hemsworth was like. i didn't [ __ ] say right. yeah what kyle what's going. on i didn't [ __ ] say that. wow that is it chris. hemsworth impressions yeah that's so. bad what is that yeah charles yeah. what do you think about the way. chris hemsworth looks he's handsome. as [ __ ] i pissed next to. him once you know what my my shoulders. are broader anyway go ahead. i i think he is extremely handy. he's handsome as [ __ ] yeah. but i think say end. instead of butt otherwise it's so dead. the end i think not only is he amazing. looking he looks like the dumbest. guy in the [ __ ] world like think about it think about it think about how [ __ ] dumb he looks dude like i remember the first still for thor. when he came out i i just started laughing. because i was like look how [ __ ] dumb this guy looks dude. why though i because he's just like a big. and bulky and blonde but he's not really like yeah. beautiful eyes just like probably okay. what about uh [ __ ] the one guy that uh kristen likes and whatever. it's not not a big deal. i don't know who jason. moa right no he doesn't look. as dumb but he's so big. that guy yeah but he doesn't look. dumb to me. he looks like he's probably like read. a lot of poetry and has a lot. of his brain but chris hemsworth is. like doesn't know like what a book. is that's what he looks. like you know wow yeah. he thinks like books. are just things for old people. like he he doesn't understand. so ask me about a book. you think chris hemsworth is. like this all right. matt how's it going yeah uh what'd you. think of the great gatsby i don't know. yeah right it's good the and he's just thinking about the movie. you know had it laying out. of the camera yeah we were up. for the same part right. he would audition and almost get the role. and still not know one. day is that guy who's also in it. toby maguire he's good. that actually does sound like him. that one the first one. you did sounded nothing like him. hey toby mcguire he's good. yeah yeah um i'm thor. it's like ask him. about a book ask. him about a book. um so uh the sun also rises is. a favorite of mine. i'm a thor [applause] christian. bale's in the new one. just can't just when he freezes. or doesn't know what to. say the sun also rises is what. it's called the sun also rises yeah. there's a movie um that. the guy who is in passenger. 57 is in um wesley snipes. yeah he did a movie. with um the guy who played james. bond oh sean conrad yeah something about yes on rising sun that's like that one no but that is basically rising sun is. also based on a book. right yeah so do you know. what a book is yep. so what they'll do is they'll. do um tell me what. a book is so i've read books. a ton of books. i've read the first book. i read was batman returns um. they make a movie right. and then what they'll do. is they'll do like a synopsis. of it and sell it. in like walgreens or something. yeah yeah yeah yeah batman. returns is the first book i read. novelization is what that's called. after a movie is made they make a book. about it it's called a novelization right. the movie first which is crazy. because it makes you think how they made books. hundreds of years ago. before film existed right. yeah this is by the way. exactly what he's like for sure. i repeat next one once. he's handsome his [ __ ] my shoulders. are broader but he's more cut so you win. some you lose he's just more. handsome in general than you by. like 10 10 times it's not. like that dude it's it's honestly. it's one of those things that's like you know. yeah sure you can get the cookie. cutter [ __ ] or you can get the dude. where it's like yeah maybe some people. think he's handsome might be some people. don't but there's something no everybody's. extra special about him don't say. it for me thank you. oh no i'm saying for me. yeah there's something about him. for me people go like that. about me oh okay. and i peed next to. him and then i go when he was like or something. i remember and then i presented an award. with kristen emilian and he went like this. no he didn't but in his head. he probably didn't oh it. was the people's choice award. is what it was okay. and i presented with christina. milian okay and who is one. of the most beautiful women in the world. i don't even know who that. is honestly she's a singer. and that's why yeah so she's great. cool so that's how the story ends. i bet she knows what books. are yeah um okay let's do another. one this is not the right. time you're just going to. delete brothers what's going on my name. is nolan uh but [ __ ] nowhere mendocino california. i own and operate a licensed weed. farm down here checking on the ladies um that. brings me to. my question these are the ladies. i spend the most time with i'm originally. from orange county shout out. laguna hills oh yeah laguna nigal dana. point um okay growing up down there you know there's a lot of attractive people and uh now living where i'm at not so much um i like to. think i have some kind of standards. when it comes to. dating but out here it's so limited. i am questioning my. standards um love to. hear what you guys think. if you lived in the middle. of nowhere where an la4 is like a nine or a ten. you're out there smashing those fours. or you're sticking your standards. and uh just working hard. you know that's all i got to. do out here so love to. hear what you guys think. uh thank you for putting out. all your content really appreciate it. gets me through my days all. right later thanks nolan what i think about that. is i think you're thinking about it. the wrong way actually you're you you. shouldn't apply your standard to. the people that you encounter. you need to. experience the way the person. you encounter makes you feel and i don't i don't mean. like necessarily just emotionally. like physically whether you're turned on by. someone or wise sure. but like and then you after that. you apply sort of like the thing. you if you're doing it too. superficially from the outside you can. really get in your own way. and just be like a [ __ ] idiot who's just like not up. to my standards not up to. my standards not up to. my standards but like if you get in there first and like don't have the idea of a standard in your mind and you're just experiencing the people around. you i think you have a probably a better. chance of finding someone uh attractive. than otherwise even when it. comes to physically like boner inducing. [ __ ] specifically that really yeah yeah yeah so you're almost saying lead with your heart. not really though no not really i'm saying. i think having a standard and applying. that before you like thinking about that. first and foremost can get in your way. of actually finding someone attractive. then why doesn't he just do. that with people and not just chicks. maybe he [ __ ] does it with a dude and then falls in love with the dude. and sure that's a [ __ ] great question. yeah so you're saying maybe he's gay. possibly or bi definitely possible. nothing that he exhibited made me. think that right but yeah sure he could be yeah hmm. um it's like when straight guys go to. all men all male jails they like often have longterm sexual. relationships with the men in jail they're not gay. i would do that congratulations. that's my not my point. if if what if you were in jail for life would you [ __ ] up for life yeah here's the thing i would [ __ ] guys if i felt like [ __ ] guys there's not no part of me that would if i felt like it resist i would do it even if i didn't feel like it i'd be like let's just [ __ ] we gotta see what's up here oh and i would do it why i mean like dude you're in there for life and like you just like you talk about like just mixing it up [ __ ] why not okay yeah hey bro what are you in here for oh [ __ ] really capital murder yeah what are you doing tonight you're right okay you turned on by murderers no but like you you like brian mcknight and you play some and then you just you know what i mean yeah that's the second time we've talked about brian mcnair. so uh what's your [ __ ] advice. i think first of all this. guy's let me just say. i get it this. guy's in trouble orange county. i don't know how often you've been to. orange county rare i'm rarely there but dude the the women there from like i mean dude even like the 50 year old moms are like you would you would gnaw your arm off to. to [ __ ] go out with they're so hot so but that's where he was yeah that's where he's from okay so this dude i mean i see it better even better than i think better than hollywood because like everyone comes to. hollywood and these models are all. like you know wafey and like fake looking but bro. you go to orange. county they're a little bit fake looking but like and there's a lot of plastic surgery. but dude just the sun and the outdoor relaxing living and then not trying. to prove anything and then not trying to. like it's just they're so hot. the the dude like the guys. will be looking dude. the dudes are good looking it's just like a [ __ ] crazy goodlooking place. okay and so now he's in minnesota. i don't know where the [ __ ] that is i know. it's got that aida minnesota. farms but like the people who work there. are very ugly but like the no. no relation yeah no um well i actually think that it. is from the place is from this. is they're saying yeah no correlation. with people that are serving you a [ __ ] sandwich. in mendocino farms right. that has nothing to. do with the people the way that people look in mendocino the place. probably definitely i don't mean a bad. mouth well there's no correlation but it. still could be the same. amount of attractiveness level. could be right yeah so but that would be random. not correlated again i guess. so but wow not wanting to. give anything but um i think what makes you he's it's rough. because he's going from one. of the places where the [ __ ] hottest people are to. now a place where he just wants. to hang out with plants. right sure so like you're young. maybe work and let let this [ __ ] come to. you get on tinder or write. or whatever the [ __ ] is out there no bumble bottom is a grinder matt thinks you're gay so maybe get on if you're not attracted to. people around you then don't force yourself. to be attracted to. them yeah don't express yourself but also lead. with your you know like okay. well maybe and even matt saying. like meet dudes and maybe be open. to like she didn't say. that matt's saying you know. maybe just [ __ ] some guys and like sure if he wants to. definitely right yeah but i'm not. suggesting it and you're making it sound. like i am mmhmm uh yeah. i think it's uh a rough go dude. because like it'd be one thing if you moved from [ __ ] peoria. but you did not no i'm telling you. that's the mecca of goodlooking. people orange county orange. county not hollywood not dubai or whatever the [ __ ] you know you see all these hookers post post pictures in dubai and they're just like i'm in dubai and you're like yeah but who are you with though and she's like just out here chilling in dubai and it's like okay your pockets got fatter you're hugging right yeah okay i mean i don't know that to. be perfectly honest but i do okay. if you're in dubai and you're hot. and you're alone on social media. you're hooking okay okay okay so this. guy's in trouble and maybe shack. up with somebody not because of looks if you're gonna live. there forever or still maybe set. your tinder on on a different. place and then really get to. know them and be be like by the way. i'm in mendocino mendocin whatever. the [ __ ] you know by the way but before you get all pissed off dude i know you're not gonna want to. come move here check it. out though we can be high all the time. uhhuh yeah look at this. yeah yep yeah offer what. you got to get them. out there yeah that's right. yeah okay well another one. yeah let's do another one. look at this fella what's up. bros this is corey calling in from. missouri big fan of you. well mostly chris cause i'm a true. baby and life rips but let's be honest. man if matt wasn't there. to keep you in check we'd all. just be doing spin moves. and nothing would get done. yeah i just love the show. though can't wait to. see more so here's what i need you guys. advice on today my partner. and i have been together. almost two years now very much in love. and she's got these two beautiful. little girls that just melt my heart. they make me feel like a better. man and i would love to. be their dad one day. the issue is her her side. of the family can be a little bit toxic. her mom in particular. is always trying to. undermine her parenting take control. of things disrespect our boundaries i don't think. she's a good influence on the kids. but my partner is still always sending. them over there to. be babysat yeah and it can be disruptive. for me and i don't think it's very healthy. so i'm just not sure what i should do. do i step in and try to. keep them home more or do. i just kind of let it. be and let them figure it out. and maybe it's not so big. a deal let me know what you think thanks. guys peace out i think you. should go with that depending on. how toxic it is then they are. you know that's a word. that's been thrown around. so much lately like you don't even know. if people mean it anymore. i'm gonna take this guy for what. he's saying as as face value. though um you know that's kind of par for the course dude. is it just parents. that do that just like grandparents and like also especially like mother. fatherinlaw you know it's like this. is just the these are the issues. you're gonna have when you have a partner. especially that comes with kids. and um i think that you know. look i'm blessed to. have [ __ ] great grandparents for calvin. and [ __ ] and like um but you know even even with great. grandparents there's still things that are just gonna like you're gonna butt. heads against it's a little tricky. though because you want to. be their dad and you're not their dad. right um and hopefully you're in love and she think you know your partner. thinks that you're a great. dad you would be a great. dad and maybe you can adopt them. someday that guy's definitely would be a great. deal i mean sure seems like it right. even though he likes you more. than he likes me. he would be well that's one. of the reasons why he'd be a great. dad no um and uh you know. i just think that uh it's a uh it's a tricky. situation because you're not technically. her dad yet. but you want to. be so in a way. it's like look you got to. act what you want you. got to act the way. you want like if you're a standup. comedian you don't say i want. to be a standup. comedian you get on stage and you say i'm a standup. comedian well yeah what shows. you do i do open. mics well that's not technically what a standup community does was like yeah but it is though. every state of queen is done. set up open mics so i'm a comedian. [ __ ] off you got to. live what you want so if you want. to be their dad and the mom. is cool with you possibly. being with their dad then start acting like their dad. and say to. you know the wife the wife. your wife or your partner. um you know maybe you got to. open up dialogue and you got to. say like you know this is what your mom. did or this is what. your dad did and it's i feel like it's toxic. to the kids um how do you feel. this way if she feels the same way. then offer to. watch the kids more because you know if that's the direction that. you're going in then that's the direction you're. going in and that's direction you're going. to be in any way. uh if you will eventually be their dad. which um is hopefully going to. happen for you um what. i what i was going. to say actually is and i give great. advice it ends up. being similar to. what you said which is like i think that you are. in a position where you're like. uh i would say maybe on your way. to being their father figure being their father. basically and offer because i don't know how bad these people. are like are they putting crazy ideas. in their head that are like that's the interest. for them in their future. or are they just like [ __ ] annoying like sneaking them too much. sugar on the side like it's possible. that's a big spectrum. he's saying toxic i know. but still it could be and it could be a lot. of things sugar is toxic. what i would say is try. to be the person. that fills up their time. instead like offer your own. services which is kind of what. you're saying to be the person. that watches them as much as you can and that. also ends up covering ground. toward where you want to. be which is sort of like their father. figure and you will also be able. to show her how [ __ ] good you are at the job oh yeah good it's like a you're like you're a dad intern yeah. yeah you're interning and you're like maybe this is what we should do for the fathership right. exactly yeah look at this. well taking [ __ ] pictures just in the middle of this show what we want. right okay um so yeah uh i think that uh that's good. this guy's it's gonna be fine. this guy's got too good. of a head on his shoulder. you know why and it's like you could be like yeah but you don't know. that you don't know the partner. but like yeah but you wouldn't have such a good. head on your shoulder if it wasn't or you wouldn't be with somebody. who's so [ __ ] insane if you have that kind of a hat on yourself. i think the the woman in question. is great i think he's great. and i think probably the parents. are a little [ __ ] whackadoodledandies yeah yeah i'm a whackadoodle sweetheart. every single note was the same. you're tone deaf let's do. another one if you ever said again. your necklace your neck. will break hi my name is veronica. i'm from michigan and i have a problem. with my motherinlaw well i'm not even married. but i've been with this. guy for four and a half. years he's got three kids. um i've been living with them. for over three and he was born. in costa rica well his whole family. lives over there like his parents. and his grandparents and the mom comes. over and stays with us for like an entire month. out of the year. and her permanent address in. the united states is our house. so we have to. like go through her mail constantly which is annoying. and she's coming in two weeks. um the last time she was here. i actually saw on our nest. camera in our living room. oh boy we had to. put one up because he has a teenage girl and you know. boys whatever yeah yeah anyway i saw on the next camera that she like because we have audio she was talking so much [ __ ] about me i mean she was saying how i come from a poor family i don't know how to. handle the kids i you. know and this and that sounds out. to no one and i need advice. on how to. handle it this time. around i no longer have. access to the nest. because i never wanted to. hear somebody say stuff like that. about me again. in my own house and uh we don't even. talk like hardly at all. so should i ignore should i confront. her she has no idea i heard everything. thank you guys peace out. you should absolutely confront her. absolutely [ __ ] confront her and be like hey you know i heard you talking [ __ ] about me. is there a problem yeah. boom bing bang boom i'm a wacky doodle no. sweet huh no no. you don't so you say uh i mean yeah dude. wow dude caller [ __ ] out got no do you know what oh [ __ ] that's crazy you got no time for this but you have to. you have to. tell the guy first you don't think she's. told no no i'm saying that. you're going to talk. to them oh or or maybe have him. deal with it if it's his mom hmm you know what i'm saying i don't know i'm just trying to. think of like maybe where like my like either. kristen or my girlfriends in the past. have been like hey this is happening. can you talk to. your mom or dad. about this what about. the other way around has it. ever been you have a problem. right with yeah the parent. of your partner and you want. your partner to handle. it instead of you i don't ever i'm just like who cares. yeah i would do it. i guess that's okay. yeah well then i guess i would do it yeah. so well i would definitely do it. to the dad but not to. maybe not to the mom. right i mean i would do it. to anybody i'm kind of confrontational. though so am i yeah. but um like that you are yeah. oh okay yeah i mean i think she should do. it but if he doesn't want her to. specifically maybe he has a point. maybe it would be better. if he did it better. for both of them but but i i don't know. and i don't pretend to. know i'm just saying that woman. needs to be confronted. what is she doing talking [ __ ] about you inside your house. that you let her stay. yeah also who she month out of the goddamn. um by the way i want to. give props to this. [ __ ] lady for saying you don't have access to. this nest cam anymore. because you don't want to. hear that is such a grownup. way to handle that. i don't actually think i understand. can you tell me she's saying. she heard that and then she was like all. right i'm not checking this nest thing. anymore i'll have my husband deal. with it we have it. all you know what i mean. like which is awesome. that's like that's like the number one. way to deal. with it because why [ __ ] have that [ __ ] enter your brain. if you don't need need it to. be but that's [ __ ] up dude she's getting yo oh oh you want to. get your mail at my house. yeah yeah oh walk in like that. and say that first that's what it. should be like oh you want to. get oh with all the mail. just letting it [ __ ] fall out of your hands and be like but what's up with the [ __ ] talk though but what's up with this [ __ ] oh you think because you get mail here that you can talk [ __ ] about the other people that live here well let me tell you how it's gonna be and listen to. hit him up first listen. to hit him up okay. when he's just like when i you know. i [ __ ] your [ __ ] you fat. [ __ ] and he's like by the end we got [ __ ] my this is how we're going to. do this [ __ ] mob deep [ __ ] bat brother [ __ ] [ __ ] you won't be done with them [ __ ] you two and then approach her and be like oh you want to. get mail here [ __ ] i think that might i mean i just said i was confrontational. but i think that might be a bit much. like this because then i think you might immediate i think you might immediately. enter being in the wrong. yeah but also you'd be like this. how we do it. in [ __ ] america dude and then play lean back [laughter] and then be like and then with the nest cam. just showing her and then you have to. lower the music because hold on. let me let me make this. louder this is what you did. so two songs this is such a time. commitment well you play the tupac. thing and then you go. in and then you do it. with the [ __ ] lean back [ __ ] while you're doing it and then you turn down the volume. of lean back and then you turn up. the nest cam and be like i heard you're doing this. what about just going. up there and saying hey i heard you i don't know. if you knew this. but you were actually on camera. documented on video talking. [ __ ] about me in my house. would you mind telling me. what that's about that. would be ball if i'm the lady. do you know what i do. no i i don't speak english. i'm from but but she knows. she knows that you can speak speak to. me as a later i am. from costa rica i don't know [ __ ] idiot go ahead say well i heard you talking [ __ ] in english about me i was guessing words. [music] yeah well yeah okay i don't know. what i say english. why that would be maddening you know. oh that would be the best. dude then you'd have a right. to kick her out. of your house yeah maybe yeah the guy should be really mad. though yeah you know what i mean. just he should be [ __ ] not his wife. like come on come on mom. it'd be so hard to. [ __ ] do that with your parents. you know do what to. be like you were talking. [ __ ] about my wife i think it would be so easy to. be like hey mom stop talking [ __ ] about it but you know mom our house. but you know moms. the next generation like your mom's. dad but like the next generation's. gonna be like i didn't do that. [ __ ] or you know what she needs to. this you know moms. you know yeah but especially if she's already. saying like you know you don't deal. with the kids right. or whatever the [ __ ] you're not you're a bad mom. she thinks she's a bad mom. she's like well you know. i i've been doing this. i'm [ __ ] yeah you know i've been i've raised kids i raised you and she needs to. this and that you know. how it goes still though. even even more so though. even more so whatever more so like oh yeah just get it. out yeah [ __ ] open call her out to. her face look her in the [ __ ] eye look. her right in the [ __ ] eye have that nest. cam ready though she said she doesn't have. access to anyone i know. but have the husband give her that. ready to be like you know. slide it on over i say i say set. up more cameras cut try to. catch her doing it again. and get several different angles. of it and then get take the footage. and then cut it together. like super dramatic yeah yeah like a good. movie scene and then say we all want to. sit down and watch a family. movie oh wow with her there and put it on that's great. and everyone's looking at the screen. you just stare at her yeah. and hire richard hired [ __ ] david attenborough to. do the [ __ ] that would be good yeah yeah and watch the motherinlaw. yeah talk right mad [ __ ] yeah yeah we thought it was all good. but did you know. that motherinlaw's especially from a generation. above you talk [ __ ] about you yeah yeah she bad at parenting. it could be expensive. to get him to. do it probably really expensive. yeah um yeah okay want to. do one more or what do we have one. more all right what's up guys. so i've been a huge fan. of yours for the longest. time specifically because your family. dynamic is so similar. to mine wow that all of your stories make me. go they get it. ah nice like everything from the a little bit. more toast button to like the number of pieces. of meat in the spaghetti yeah the amount of sauce. on the calamari is just i can. totally imagine having these conversations. with my dad except we have our. own situations my dad once put alfredo sauce. on his salad ate the whole thing. and never realized it. wasn't ranch dressing whoa wow. so i feel like advice from you. is going to be all. the more relevant huh. i moved to china in 2018. and i've been here since then now. at the very beginning. it was great like my parents. would come and visit once a year and i would go home once a year and so it was ideal get to. see my family and i get to. have my awesome job that i have here i get to. be with my awesome girlfriend i live in an awesome. apartment just like my whole life. quality situation was amazing the then. covet happened and they completely. shut down travel here so if i leave there's no guarantee. i can come back right. and if i do finally manage. to come back i need. to do a mandatory three weeks. of quarantine before i can do anything. so like there's no like hey job. can i have off for a month. in three months i'm sorry. a month in three weeks. yeah right so i haven't seen my family. in two and a half. years damn and i'm kind of at the point. where it's like how much longer. can i do this yeah because i planned. on living here this. wasn't like a temporary yeah. i really like being here i speak the language. like i've i've settled. down here but at the same. time like how long can i go. with just never seeing my family. and it's just getting suckier all. the time my family. met up for christmas. and they all had this awesome. time together and not me wow. that sucks this place. here is called latina huh. next it's relevant so. what do you think i should do. latina um a two and a half. year i'm trying to. i mean dude if you didn't see your uh me. for two and a half years. it's a really long time. ah but it's already been two. and a half years how much longer. could it possibly be. from now well yeah that but that's what he probably. said a year in he did. but now it's even more true. or it's just going to. keep going yes i mean. i don't know what it's like what. else can he do he's going. to move back home. but he's in a situation. where he's with the [ __ ] love of his life and he has his dream job. what is it now. well how come his parents. can't come out there. because it's they're just old and they they don't. want to quarantine too why don't they just move. you know old people you know what dude. it's kind of if i don't know. how old they are he looks. kind of youngish but like maybe you could you couldn't ask. mom and dad to. move to [ __ ] china i could not yeah like i could not you're saying yeah. you know they would say no well. yeah because they're they work. but if dad i don't know the different. situation though if if i had a grandkid and mom and dad. were 75 and they were done. working i mean you know mom. and dad would come out. for six months yeah. at a time yeah you know. what i mean so but i don't know what their situation. is that's true maybe they could yeah. you know i mean they're older. and if they're retired. then it's i think i think you should delegate. also if the [ __ ] dad ate fettuccine. sauce on his salad. thought it was ranching no. what the [ __ ] is going on he doesn't even know where he is put him in china he doesn't even know. you'd be like this is [ __ ] still nashville or whatever. yeah yeah yeah yeah you know. i would be like oh it looks different. everyone has tans but like you know. yeah and they cough in your faces. but we don't know about. the mom though yeah she might notice. i mean if she's with a uh i guess. i don't know man i mean. i think it's i think i think it's fair. to say it's definitely a little bit. more on the older generation. the mom and dad. your mom and dad. to figure something out a little bit. more but but then again. it's not just his mom and dad. it's his whole family right. he said yes it's his sister. brother so maybe so they're not going. to move just for him. so yeah it is kind of more. on him i think just wait. i think china's not going. to have a zero covert. policy for another two years it. might be another one year. but dude you've been two and a half. into it just wait one more year. yeah and then go home for a whole month. wait a little bit yeah. yeah i think the move is to. just wait a little bit more. now you're so if you're in it. you're so deep into. it just bear down and keep going yeah. and also like when you show. up bring some alfredo. sauce yeah but that'll be so sweet. to be man i would cry. so much that's uh oh that's rough bro. that sucks man yeah. what bad timing you had when you moved. to china bad bad job. yeah it's his fault. bad job at having timing when it comes to. moving yeah but i like that guy's energy. he was really good i loved that. yeah yeah seems like you're doing. well anyway even though you haven't. seen your family but also like dude. you know this is part. of like growing up and becoming like now. you're the guy who has the relationship. with the woman and like you're gonna maybe have kids. and [ __ ] these are like the decisions god. being an adult [ __ ] sucks dude yeah my son was running. around you know what he was doing he had a bunch of dice like eight. no like ten dice in in a [ __ ] i had no i i had nose uh i had a what do you call it a bacteria in my nose i went to. the nose doctor gave me pills. and it's all cleared. up and the pill. bottle is empty and calvin's. like ah he wanted the [ __ ] pill. bottle and he took a bunch of dice and just put it in the pill. bottle he's just carrying around. all day that's what we did. all day yesterday i left. today that was doing all. day today and he just look at my beaut beautiful. dice that's what he says for. beautiful look at my beautiful. dies in that little pills. bottle and all he does. is just dump it out. pick it out and put it back. in man that's the [ __ ] dude that's
