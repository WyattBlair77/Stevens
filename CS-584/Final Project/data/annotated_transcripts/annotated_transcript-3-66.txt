[music] hello [music] oh you keep saying. let's start and then we're not starting. but did you mean it. this time yeah oh okay. so and like uh it's okay everything's good but you you. look good today oh you say like i don't actually. usually no i i um you know. it's never a competition but you look better. than me today and it's fine. well why are you wearing your sunglasses. we talked about this and how i don't like it. well yeah but my my eyes. are because you look bad. sometimes make me seem like i'm ugly. that just means you're ugly. no if you're a person that says my eyes. make me see you know. it's like i'm ugly you're ugly. you know what's cool about. it is my my um my eyebrows. are above my my sunglasses. i didn't realize that a lot. of people's eyebrows go behind their sunglasses. but when you have eyebrows that go above. your sunglasses you get like all sorts. of extra cool points. i think like jack nicholson. i was gonna say jack nicholson. is the one that i think of yeah. uh what do you mean. extra points uh extra points. are extra cool points. who gives them where do. you keep them what are you. doing these are not tangible dudes okay. i came to here right. now and there's a [ __ ] silver dollar right. here 50 cent because you're above. your sunglasses you know. what i don't like is when [ __ ] guys talk about 50. cent the rapper and they say 50 cent why do they do that why. do white guys like with [ __ ] button downs do that i don't know because they think it's [ __ ] funny i guess no i think sometimes think they think that that's what it is it's it's it's uh mildly racist if they think it's what it is then yeah it is yeah actually you guys like fitty's. i'm a 50 cent i like 50 cent you know those guys that like barbecues with open. toe [ __ ] sandals they all always have uh buttondown shirts yeah that are blue a shade of blue yeah one shade of blue or another yeah no matter what yeah i know yeah oh you already knew yeah then forgive me for [ __ ] they get pink when they drink yeah definitely they get like lobstery yeah yeah yeah for sure [ __ ] yeah it's because they're probably already a little sunburned from like yeah from being out on a boat that shitty vacation there oh dude that and they got that [ __ ] stale beer sting you know we went to. high school with so many of those guys i know that's why i know about the 50. cent thing because they say 50. cent okay so but their dads. say it mostly their dad. said well not anymore. a lot of them are dead. and some of them are 75. but downer well the whole. thing is a downer dude. 50

all right so um let's do it you want to. do the first one first devices. yeah i'm going to. get my hood on for that. yeah you don't need a hood. for that but i want to. okay let's go what's up. chris what's up matt my name. is brett and first of all thank you. guys so much for doing this. podcast i know everybody's been thanking you but nobody can really thank you. enough so thank you for doing. this i have two questions. for you guys actually if you want to. stop after the first i can't do anything. about that it's free. conch but my first one is in a few weeks after i graduate i'm moving down. to atlanta i got my dream. job i seriously can't. wait to start i'm so excited. but the problem is i know nobody in the entire state. of georgia so i guess. what i'm asking you guys. is what are some tips. or advice you have for me. to organically meet people who aren't [ __ ] weirdos really also side note. chris coming to. see you september 9th in atlanta. can't wait there you go. and my second question is the church. of k was matt's first episode. on congratulations do you guys. still use k to. help you because i've gotten my entire family. and friend group to. use the term k whenever. somebody says something so let me know. love you both thanks so much. let's get one of those spinny. hats on with the fan. look at the propeller he's a wise. person he's just floating. a little bit yeah um i invented k. okay so of course i still say. it yeah uh have you backed off a little bit. though on it uh yeah you know i backed off we grow you know what i mean. well only with people who think it's some kind of insult. which bothers me to. no end that's like they'll be. like oh you oh you kid. me as if it's like an affront to. them no no and i try to. tell people it's [ __ ] for me. yeah [ __ ] you and then i am insulting them. so it makes the whole thing. [ __ ] point oh right yeah sometimes i'll do it under my breath. it really is just for me. so under my breath. yeah right people don't hurt. i hear you do it. i hear you do it. sometimes i do you throw out. a little bit okay. sometimes so you do still use it. i don't really use it. that much yeah you never did. it wasn't really uh doing karate. never really i'll just go. ahead i'll do that more. yeah yeah right but you'll do it. quiet under your breath sometimes too i'll hear you doing it yeah yeah um you think i do a key. eye like a karate ki what the [ __ ] is a key. eye height sit we should just do that what's that one that's what it's called. really yeah yeah that's what it's called. okay it might be a japanese word. anyway the first question was how do you uh meet people you gotta do it. organically otherwise you're gonna be crazy. people look everybody's crazy. anyway but fan out dude. i think we should go. back to the old ways. like [ __ ] the internet [ __ ] hinge [ __ ] whatever it is you know what i mean the the the instagram and the online shits dude and go way back go way back into. make flyers like flyers. have a head shot do a bow and say milady. yeah stick out your hand. lady would you like to. be a friend no no. no um fan out get get head. shots small cards like you're a model. and go you know. what i mean nice guy. here get your friend friendship for sale. uh but no you know. don't sell it but like get your friend. here uh new fresh face in the area. you will meet the [ __ ] worst people that way i would be me i'd be i'd come right. up to you and be like oh you want. to be friends no you would not although i do. make sure you're just [ __ ] friends i know in the history of the [ __ ] world get your friend here oh dude that's a terrible idea but what you should free friend okay is you just something that is actually a forgotten a lost art even though i hate when people say that yeah is making friends in real life i've talked to. people in l.a we're like i don't know. you can't even approach like guy. friends or like i can't even approach a woman. in real life it's like it's like too forward. it's like creepy and yeah. like really that's the rules. now i didn't [ __ ] realize that but i think for most people certainly outside of la. i'm assuming in atlanta as well. it's like a refreshing thing. when people come up and talk to. you and just sort of like get to. know you not like a [ __ ] weirdo yeah like what's your favorite color. you know don't know that's pretty cool. but like if you see it like the kind of person. that you want to. know yeah just [ __ ] say something. that gets you in there. you know yeah and sometimes they'll be like ah because they want to. meet someone new but whatever. [ __ ] them you're never going to. see him again friend you're talking about uh friendship. straight up like yes like not even. like dating yeah i mean. yeah yeah yeah hmm it's tough to. meet people organically no one has friends. anymore that's true if no one has friends anymore. that means everyone wants friends. so that means everybody's ready. to make friends so if you're the [ __ ] person that is gonna have the balls to. go do it then that's good. just go [ __ ] do it he seems like he's yeah he's got the courage. do people want to. make friends still you think well. no what i know is they don't. have them yeah they should want. to make them but i don't know. if they do but they should because we need people people need people people need that's what he's saying. i wonder where he's coming. from but you know what also don't push it you know. what i'm talking about like it'll happen. he's a [ __ ] nice dude. he's a regular guy seems like in a good. way he'll be in atlanta atlanta's great. dude atlanta's really great. atlanta people are [ __ ] nice people in the south are nicey. [ __ ] you know is that right. yeah dude go to. the mall in atlanta go to. the mall you will see the brightest. colors and the biggest asses. oh and so many so many dudes that laugh. like this like in atlanta it's insane. dude so many hats. not just with a regular brim like this. but hat psycho dude when you go. to atlanta it's pretty much. the kentucky derby oh. just nonstop yeah it's just nonstop you'll be in an elevator and you'll be like is there. a horse race. in here yeah it's unreal. dude the shortest horse. face ever just in there. just obviously you if you're an elevator without people with the hats. on you yeah yeah yeah like yeah yeah dude. i mean it's it's absolutely. insane atlanta is is atlanta is insane. dude i've only been to. atlanta twice very briefly both times really. can't speak to. atlanta yeah why because you got you're only gonna for how long well i went for a wedding. both times i was there. for like three days tops. both times oh yeah weddings. it doesn't count if you've been somewhere. for a wedding because you gotta like focus on the couple. and [ __ ] they're being so rude about it so i hated it. i hated the experience i had. yeah i can't say i hated atlanta because i'm not. really there yeah yeah over what i'm saying. because i haven't said it yeah you know what i'm saying. yeah yeah okay you're doing. it okay all right. well let's do another one. we gave him good advice. yeah what about the workplace. i mean yeah well we don't know. what he's doing depends on what he does. i mean you're going to. make friends in the workplace. if you don't make friends. in the workplace you're a huge loser. like if you're if you don't make friends. with you like people who who leave work and don't have friends. there you're a huge loser. unless you're yeah unless you're like a [ __ ] postmates guy then it's creepy. if he's going to. do post base move. to atlanta do postmates. and then he's like hey your order's on the way. and then they drop it. off and the guy opens the door. and he's just like what's your favorite. color like one time. i had a postmate actually try to. make friends with me at my door. yeah and he was like asking me. about where i live and he like could see past. me a little bit and he's like oh what's it. like in there these kinds of places. yeah that's crazy should we turn the air. down yeah um dude i had a postmates. guy once show up dropped the food. off and then one time weeks later. uh all of a sudden there. was a head shot of the postmates. guy on my kitchen island. table oh yeah you remember that. yeah yeah yeah dude how did you get in how'd it. get in there that's no good. kristen didn't know how it got there it. was so weird i hope that it. was just like right somebody that. came in that was like oh yeah you had this. at your door but i still don't know. what the [ __ ] had to. do the problem is is that they never they will never not know. where you live henceforth. i know so like there's a weird i know. thing like i don't want to. leave uh too much of a shitty. review because what if it turns. into like the cable guy i know taxi. driver kind of situation you know. yeah balancing these people is very very hard. you know what i mean. yeah because there are people out. there that are crazy and it's just hard. to balance these people. you know yeah yeah um so yeah i don't know. but it's workplaces if you you gotta make friends in workplace. that's probably the number one. place at least in the beginning if you're moving for work great make friends you know be super nice he's nice wear my merch. connect on people you know. what i mean oh you you also know. are you gonna go see him. in atlanta september 9th i mean. so [ __ ] selfcentered but you can though yeah but just simply can yeah count on you to. recommend the way to. meet people is to. bring you up well. or let's go travel to. dc this september 10th. yeah yeah i'll be there. all right so anyway plug in yourself. so [ __ ] hard do another one yeah [music] hey man chris my name is cody i live in massachusetts. and i'm calling with some career. questions so i've been working as an engineer. for five years now and i think like a lot. of people my age i don't necessarily. love what i do there. are definitely some hobbies i partake in that. i think would make a better fulfilling. career for me um but when having a fulltime job and stable. income you create all these excuses. for yourself all these roadblocks. that stop you from really going. for something you might love because it might affect your life. so the advice i'm looking for is. um how can you get over. limits you put on yourself. how can you really just go. for something that you love. and not worry about the outcome. not be scared of the outcome. not strive for perfection right. away um let me know what you guys think thanks uh i have i have the best of he's wearing a boxing robe. what was that yeah he's getting. out

[ __ ] makes me brm. oh we know and i have to. try so hard not to. get an attitude about it. but then other times i'm like okay. maybe i need to. just chill out like they're doing. me the favor whatever no big deal. and other times i'm like [ __ ] that how hard is it. to just say you're welcome. or anything like why are you being [ __ ] rude. anyways just want to. see what you guys think. about it dude. it's okay i got one. further though you people you open. the door she says you open. the purse there are people over. the door for you that's nice. yes then you say thank you. some people would be like that's the end. of the exchange they would be. like you open the door. for me i reciprocated that's our that's the end. here okay but i've got one. further dude i know what you're gonna. say yeah sometimes you open. the door for people they just walk right. through like they're the [ __ ] king of starbucks. yeah nothing hey dude nothing makes me. more [ __ ] furious in terms of like a an an everyday scenario. it's awful all you got to. do all you got to. do is just look at me. nod smile say thanks do [ __ ] anything to. acknowledge what i just [ __ ] did it's not like i did something great but like how miserable are you [ __ ] it's easier to. just say thanks than to. swallow it and be like [ __ ] this guy yeah you have hate in your heart. get rid of it dude. be free you know i've lived in my life. i've had hate in my heart. you got to let it go. dude you got to. just say thank you they're doing. something nice if you don't that's on. you that [ __ ] turns into. cancer that festers and then one day and it becomes chest. cancer or whatever it is. dude cancer brain. cancer and aneurysm i think though for the for her. i think the advice is yeah. it's about not going forward. with your day in fury right. and i think the key. to that is to. recognize that is a miserable [ __ ] and they're doomed. no matter what yeah right. i mean and it goes both. ways if you open the door. for someone and they don't even acknowledge. it that is a miserable [ __ ] yeah they're having a bad blip. they're not gonna have a fun. blip they're gonna have a bad. [ __ ] blip yeah and that's that that is already enough to. to know to go forward. with your day to. know well that person's [ __ ] anyway hey just stop him oh right whoa yeah what's going on in your life. man what's going on here. what's around here what's going. on here imagine if you did. that imagine if you did when someone moved you said open. the door they said thank you. and you stu you said. thank you and they don't say. anything and you go whoa. what's going on here. yeah but you slide in front of them. yeah yeah yeah yeah whoa yeah was it the end. of the exchange yeah yeah. that person would be so weirded out. yeah but do that and then also this. is a great thing. where you can implement. a spin move and walk out. but i'm just saying you knew that. was coming at some point. yeah you could um yeah i've done. that multiple times a lot of times i say. a lot of times i go oh okay. that's what i do yeah. i say oh yeah yeah yeah yeah falling. but yeah oh yeah busting. too early but yeah first. guy who busts in the origin. all right um yeah i think that that's a it's a it's a it's a it's that's on the other person. yeah but yeah it is important. to go forward with your day. not being so full of rage. though yeah you got to. live with people you got to. let it go and you got and people are in the world. and they're going to. make you feel a certain way. and you got to. just let it go it's really. [ __ ] hard trust me i get it. i get it yep yeah. [ __ ] on your side. though [ __ ] him though okay well guys my name is lucas. i'm in seattle washington so happy. i'm big fan of the new. show love what you guys. are doing um so i have a younger. brother he's always had this. mentality that the world is against him. but he's still a gogetter. don't get me wrong. but only to. the extent to. where he feels comfortable if he makes a big. move he has to. know somebody there for him to. actually commit to something. um you know it's always kind of been a drawback. for him uh i was born and raised. in mississippi always hated it. out there i worked hard to. get where i'm at in this. world you know i'm happy. i'm trying to live life. to the fullest because life does. in fact rip right. yeah it does um my brother. calls me all the time. he complains like he hates his job. he hates where he's from. but he just won't do anything. about it you know. i keep telling him. he just needs to. take the plunge and just leave and go somewhere. but like i said he's really uncomfortable. just leaving what he knows any advice. to kind of give him the extra motivation. to just take the leap. and just grab life by the balls. again love the show guys um any advice. would be greatly appreciated. thank you i know it's tom okay. them next time he calls and complains i hate my job. i hate where i live. tell him you're gonna [ __ ] die. okay this is gonna die. and you're gonna [ __ ] die. and it's gonna be miserable okay. because you lived a miserable life. in a miserable place. with a miserable job. get the [ __ ] out of there you're gonna die. yeah but also if you say that. too much then the guy's gonna think yeah. you're right you're gonna die. [ __ ] it i might as well just stay here no this guy needs to. be scared is my point you got to. scare this guy out of complacency and so you got to. shake him up even more. aggressively you're going to. [ __ ] die okay it's a bit much i think that maybe just the realization of you're just going to. be stuck in the same place. because also go back to. you're just a blip and if he's just a blip. then what's it matter. what he does right. so you got to. ride that line of look. dude this is your life. make the most of it come. out why don't you invite him. to seattle he lives in mississippi. right is that what he said he said. he's from there i don't know. if he's okay well his brother. lives somewhere he doesn't want to. and he wants to. move but yeah dude. the truth is he is going. to die it is scared. to move and here's the other thing. too as a brother you can. be like look i don't want to. hear about this [ __ ] i made my move yeah i'm happier. now you don't like where you are. as a brother i don't want. to be hearing about this. [ __ ] anymore now i have a bit of a little bit of a bad brother. if that's what you do. because you could be an earpiece for the guy. but also that could be what he needs. i mean dude this guy could be literally addicted to. his life he could be addicted to. where he lives he could be addicted to. that [ __ ] small town in mississippi. wherever he is that he doesn't like and if he is. then he needs to. hit [ __ ] rock bottom and have his brother be like look dude you're complaining too much yeah this is [ __ ] yeah listen to. you you gotta leave i'm out. of this [ __ ] [ __ ] uh complainy relationship. yeah you make me miserable you're affecting. other people i live my life. in seattle it's beautiful. it's bright it's sunny it's not. it rains but yeah you know what i mean. like move yeah yeah get your life. on track baby yeah yeah sell coke. okay well no i mean just do something. different the thing about the push weight. is that it may be. depressing but you're [ __ ] lucky it's the least likely [ __ ] ever dude so make the [ __ ] most of it it's not about your insignificance yeah it's about your lucky as [ __ ] to. get this minor blip because most. of everything is pure [ __ ] darkness. right so get the [ __ ] out of that. shitty ass [ __ ] job do something else that is true. it's not like to. work hard and make it you'll be a success. that's not necessarily [ __ ] true yeah but you don't want us. [ __ ] sit away and wither away. somewhere man you can't do that. [ __ ] i agree with that stop letting him complain. to you [ __ ] that enough is enough if he could does it that much it's not helping him anymore. it's it's just like a it's just like a [ __ ] shoulder to. cry and it doesn't help. i'd like to know. how long it's been because it's tough it's it's tough dude. it's a tough love is. is like a thing in theory. that makes sense it's not. like you stopped talking i know yeah. right okay you're so talking like i don't want to. hear this [ __ ] anymore. yeah yeah either try to. [ __ ] change it or i don't want to. hear it anymore. because what am i going. to do i'm just going. to listen [ __ ] that i gave you my advice now either take it or don't but stop [ __ ] complaining yeah but is there a tender way to. say that stop complaining i don't think you need. to be tender really. it's his brother yeah but he obviously cares. about him it's not a matter. of that i guess so yeah. you don't have to. always be [ __ ] tender he'll. get it he'll if he explains it. with his words he can't. just be like stop complaining that would be good. you know oh look [ __ ] johnny. depressed [ __ ] head is calling again johnny. depressed [ __ ] head johnny depressed. head um yeah i don't know it's [ __ ] sad. man that made me this. reminds me of people who speak your and never [ __ ] take it that's what it [ __ ] sounds like yeah this guy's bitching and moaning about his job about his life about his whatever the [ __ ] and he never [ __ ] changes it um it's the same [ __ ] thing yeah you on the other end of it you can change the at least the fact that you're his like shoulder to. cry and when he's not going. to do [ __ ] about it anyway right it can light a fire under someone's ass and so i'm right you're gonna [ __ ] die tell him next time he calls pick up. just say that first true. but is it is the guy. actually asking him for advice. or is he just trying. to motivate his brother unsolicited yeah he's asking us. what he can do yeah. to help his brother but he's not saying that. his brother is always calling him. asking him for advice and then no but i still think he should say. stop [ __ ] calling me and [ __ ] complaining yeah that's what you're saying that's your advice. yeah i'm saying is he is the brother. even complaining yes that's what he says yes. yes i mean guy [ __ ] has the videos on his [ __ ] computer and looks at him and screens him and then plays him again here has no idea what the [ __ ] video is about he's trying to. sabotage us yeah so i'm sorry. so what's this video about you. [ __ ] put it in the goddamn timeline. i i see a lot and i get them. mixed up he's so drunk. right now um i see a lot. honestly and i get mixed. up man i wasn't sure. if he's raised from all right. dude uh next one well my question has to. do with tattoos i've got a couple and this is the only one that. people ever make comments about well. because you understand why yeah maybe for good. reason i don't really think so but uh i grew up. in tanzania uganda for most. of my life and that's why. i got the tattoo and people will make comments about it. and some people say that. they don't think that i should have. it because oh wow uh the way that i look and um i disagree. with that i think it's it's something. that means a lot to. me so uh let me know what you guys. think um chris i'm sorry. i've got long hair and no facial. hair it's okay i don't know. i'll sense you at the end. about it well i mean. it's not like he's walking. up to people and being like hey oman yeah. you know that's jamaican. sorry what's on his. chest what oh yeah it's a tattoo with an outline. of africa it's africa. and he's super white he's not just even white. yeah he could just i mean he's got like crazy. there are white people in africa south. africa mainly yeah right. so well i mean you should have got just south africa you could also be like referring. to like the genesis of humanity. it could be a lot. of things everybody's going to. be the same color at some point. it's not out of line. to have that like out. of hand naturally it's not [ __ ] up uh i think now is probably the wrong time to. have that but he probably got it. a while ago of course. but on his [ __ ] chest which he can wear shirts. over right didn't know like how often is he around. people with no [ __ ] shirt on he just should have got it in the a little bit over to. his right and then he would have been like [ __ ] africa man. the superhero just right. across his chest he could. also just get the entire globe. mmhmm you're saying that yeah but that's bitching out. to the vote mob dude. if he feels important about being in africa he feels. important about being in africa i mean. the guy could have spent [ __ ] a wee you know what i mean he's like this. he's saying people think he's a version. of you know those chicks. that go to [ __ ] europe for like two months. and then come back and they're like cheers. mike yeah and you're like god. damn it dude you ate a [ __ ] crumpet but if he explains i'm from there. yeah i lived my entire life. though that should do it. it's not out of line. just yeah again it's not out. of line just because you're white. if i got it that. would be [ __ ] suspect right you're actually from there i think honestly go further and just get jamaica on your forehead. so every country just every black is predominantly black [ __ ] it dude well no then then he would be out of line. in the wrong but this is what happens. when i say don't push me he's getting. pushed over dude he got something. because it feels nice to. him and then people are like you shouldn't have that. that's gonna push him over. don't tell him what to. do he went he was in africa. dude and he [ __ ] grew up in tanzania isn't that what he said yeah. and so he [ __ ] grew up there so he has something important. on his chest dude. dude you got to. live with people yeah and this. is the dude that has the africa on. his chest but this is don't push him. he'll get jamaica on his. forehead but you don't change. just because people don't like the way. you are it's just as bad as trying. to get rid of it. i understand don't go further. you don't scale back. you just stay exactly. how you are he knows. why he got it it. wasn't a [ __ ] [ __ ] up reason he's fine next time somebody has some [ __ ] to. say about it just be like what. the [ __ ] i'm from there bye no yes okay what's that whoa. why do you have africa. on your chest i'm from tread. lightly dude i'll get jamaica on. my forehead no that's not that's not it. no also getting a tattoo on your forehead. is also never the solution. i don't even know what jamaica looks. like like the outline it. would probably just look like he'd look like gorbachev. i'm not surprised but yeah um i think that next time. somebody has something to. say explain that you're from. there and if they still has a [ __ ] problem [ __ ] that person um okay yeah i guess so i mean it's better. than getting jamaican on your [ __ ] forehead. also it's not a good one. i know that tattoo is so dark. but that tattoo every tattoo was dark. no no but he didn't use. single needle i think he was triple. needle or whatever i don't. know what any of that. means okay anyway just looked like a regular tattoo to. me the outline of africa. yeah okay all right. next one hey chris and matt. um i have a question. kind of about career advice. i didn't expect to. be at the level that i'm at with my career. um i'm 30 and i'm now working at my. dream company and doing my dream. job and um i'm not sure where to. go from here i wasn't expecting. to be at this. point at this point in my life. um and i've always kind of lived. my life um hustling and you know. constantly working towards the next. thing and um and i'll be honest. i haven't really won. a lot in life. and um this is the first time. that it genuinely feels like all. of my hard work culminated into. something so um my manager's been asking me. about um my career goals. and to be honest. especially over the past couple. years i don't dream of work. anymore um my career goals. have completely changed where i don't. feel like i tie my identity. to my job anymore. and i'm not really sure where to. go from here i want. to keep doing great things. and keep moving forward and upward but i don't want. my career to be front and center. anymore wow how do i decide on the next chapter. of my life i've been spending a lot. of time with my hobbies and things. that really make me happy. like traveling and things like that. and it's been incredible. and that's the part of life. that i really want to. do and i want my work to. be secondary so how do i keep moving. upwards with my career and how do i decide the next. thing thank you i mean. did she write that out she. how does she not stutter. at all that was unbelievable. that's a good graduation this. is why she zoomed ahead in her. phone yeah dude she did what or what's her. job i i mean what she didn't. say i know uh storing acorns it. was a chipmunk there was no video. by the way for people who are just listening. yeah there's no video the thing. about my job is you know you can only store. so many acorns and in one. day it's like how many acorns can i store. so i'd like to. hang out with alvin and theodore. a bit more and go and travel places. like another tree but anyway i mean it. sounds like a typical workaholics dilemma it's just you happen. to hit that wall a little earlier. than most people i mean she said she's 30. that's [ __ ] that's really really young. for that yeah to. hit the phase of your career. where you're like well i i'm i've arrived. at where i've always wanted. to be and that does even though. it's like i think some people would be like ah it's [ __ ] too bad for you but like no it's all relative and everything's [ __ ] up for everybody but i think that she's starting to. [ __ ] figure it out anyway yeah she's just like starting to. travel more starting to. see what else is out there. i think that's the only just keep going. with that you'll find another thing. that you're passionate about the problem. is you've only been passionate about. work your whole life. and now you're starting to. see well what the [ __ ] could i possibly. be passionate about the answer. is nothing but there's stuff out. there in the world i promise. you that yeah look the grass. is always greener right. and it sounds like she's struggling about what. she wants and what she has to. do and then what she wants to. do that's kind of what everybody. feels in their life unless they really have some sort of come to. jesus moment and it's fine. and it sounds like you might be having one. of those things but also allow. yourself not to. worry about it yeah allow. yourself to just be and do your job. and you don't have to. do it forever you don't have to. do it forever that's the best. thing about you know. it's not like you're in some [ __ ] slave. labor camp i don't think so you know what i mean. no i would highly doubt. that this is where she's inspired to. be here yeah i've got the big. the you know the guy. the big guy who has the airplane. the chipmunk whipping me and making me. store acorns whatever i don't. know what his name is i wish i didn't [ __ ] find but i can't do the joke. but like he um yeah dude. it's just like do your do. your do your job. until you don't want to. do your job anymore. but also and also stack money yeah and give yourself you could also give yourself a deadline. you could give yourself a deadline. and be like i'm gonna work this. job for another year. and see how happy i am. yeah but i think the bottom line. is allow yourself not to. worry and just to. be yeah you're [ __ ] i'm smart. you're [ __ ] 30 dude you're fine her yeah i'm obviously talking to. you uh because she's the one. who called him singing advice. not you yeah um but she's 30. years old and is already out where she wants to. be that's crazy he's [ __ ] sick you're not don't be in a rush. to do anything keep traveling. keep [ __ ] around sometimes when i when i'm i fall into. these like holes where like i'll get interested. in something and then i'll burn. myself out on it learn. everything there is to. learn about it and be like yeah well now what do i do. yeah and this is outside. of work it's just like pure interest. stuff but sometimes the way. i'll stumble on a new thing. that i'm interested in is. i'll just be in a room. where there's like so usually it's someone. else's [ __ ] study or a place. where they keep their books. their office and i'll pull at random a book. and i'll make myself read. it wow and it's not that. you're guaranteed to be interested. in that subject wow. but just the fact that it's something. that you would never normally. read there will be something in there that piques your interest. and then that thing will lead to. another thing that peaks. your interest and that. thing will lead to. another thing and i'm not saying that. that's the solution but you're 30. and you [ __ ] arrived do [ __ ] like that to. just see what the hell might be next. because [ __ ] man like i know you're probably sick of hearing. this but you're in a good. position at least acknowledge that yeah. and just take it easy. on yourself uh yeah take it easy. on yourself is the main thing. i think also we don't know. what her job is if she's a [ __ ] i mean this could be one of those things like well what do you do well. i buy groceries at. the grocery store and she's like oh. okay well then you just have really really low. yeah she did say she has a manager. that's the only thing i could do yeah so you're obviously not you know what i mean. you're not the best become the manager. first and then we'll talk yeah because i'm the manager. become the manager and then we'll talk yeah yeah what kind of [ __ ] low aspirations yeah what's going on here what's going on here yeah what's around here okay not bad hey guys i just wanted to. talk to you about an issue. i've had for a while now longer than i care. to admit basically just to. cut straight to the chase. i smoke too much. weed it takes up. far too much of my time. and money and i could be using all of. that way more productively. i'm just wondering if you guys. have ever dealt with any addictions or you know just things that are distracting. you that you know aren't good. for you and how you've dealt with it. life rips thanks life does. rip addiction sucks. it's hard addiction. sucks but the thing about weed. we've talked about this a little bit. but i've known all different kinds of potheads. i've i've been one myself i still smoke. but i smoke a lot. less than i used to. what do you smoke. sticky icky or loud what do. you smoke purple lurple i don't. know any of the things that you're saying. kush chocolate thai just smoke. marijuana oh wait uh i eat it. smoke it uh chocolate we'll go. with chocolate okay chocolate time. oh wait um but i think that ganja the the kinds of stoners that. i've known range from extremely uh productive and you like can't. even tell that they're high. yeah too like the [ __ ] on the couch eating. funyuns all day playing mike. tyson's punch out until it's the next day you know never getting up still wearing pajama pants. yeah uh uh you know. and and and i i can't and that person would tell you weed. does make them lazy. but i know i know people that it actually. is the opposite they can't. really work unless they smoke. weed they can't operate unless they smoke. weed so it's like on which one of those. people are you this guy must stop you stop first. of all second of all this. guy doesn't seem like a lazy. [ __ ] i'm sensing that there's clearly some kind of problem. now yeah like when he smokes he must be. a lazy [ __ ] well the monetary thing is a big thing right yeah he's spending a lot. of money also if he's high now. i wouldn't be able to. tell dude exactly i mean. if he's high off. that ganjo right now yes i'd have no [ __ ] idea exactly so he seems like he's a functioning [ __ ] weedaholic if there even is one yeah yeah so um addiction's tough man uh you'd have to. figure out the root of the problem. are you addicted to. the drugs are you addicted to. uh some people are addicted to. the thrill you know what i mean. some people are addicted to. acting out some people are addicted to. different things so trying. to figure out what that. is um would be beneficial therapy would be beneficial um it's really. hard to struggle addiction. is always a struggle. it's not something you figure out. and um you know you just spend your life. trying to but he seems young. enough with a good head. on his shoulder on his shoulders. um i don't know i think it's a tough it's a tough thing. it's weird too because weed. is one of those things. that's like benign you can get your i mean. in australia and i think it's like america. you can just get your card. and just be be high all. the time everywhere as long. as you're not operating a [ __ ] forklift. you don't even need a card. anymore you don't oh yeah. that's true you just have to. be a vase yeah but just don't operate. a forklift and you're good but uh i think um what. the [ __ ] was i going to. say here's what i always say. to people who are like i smoked too. much weed yeah because i never had the problem. of not being able to. stop right for at least a few. days i sometimes even at my. peak of smoking so much. weed there would be days where i would not smoke. at all so it was never an actual addiction. but i would smoke. like a [ __ ] and get really high throughout the course of many days whether i was working or not i would say first things. first try to go. two or three days without doing it. at all see what happens. if you have actual withdrawals you probably have an actual [ __ ] problem yeah uh but if you don't your tolerance will actually go down. and that'll affect the economic angle. the financial angle right. it won't be as expensive. weed tolerance fluctuates like a [ __ ] if you stop for a week. one [ __ ] one of those bong rips. will get you high off. your [ __ ] ass yeah or hurry up. and hit your hot. your rock bottom and just start doing heroin. right and start dealing heroin. and doing heroin yeah getting high on. your own supply hit the rock. bottom and then come clean you're young. enough to where you'll probably be able. to get out of it. now we're not licensed physicians or. anything like that or therapists. yeah he knows that based on the advice. you just gave up but honestly. start selling heroin that is i think you sometimes. achieved it you've achieved the single worst. piece of advice in the history sometimes. the only way to. solve a problem is what what have we learned. is to create another problem. okay but not that problem. deal heroin deal and do heroin. is the worst solution get. your heroin the guy in atlanta with friends. that's a heroin free friend. with a pound of heroin. that's how you can make [ __ ] friends one free friend on one pound of heroin. hello what are you doing. excuse me hello oh why. are you english when you do. it um because it's an oldtimey thing. to hawk stuff on the street. and everyone was english. back then in the old times oh okay. got it well dude. they weren't [ __ ] and even in america. they talked like that no they did in movies. they did those that. like uh midatlantic action those movies that john malkovich. is in he does him. and i do him dangerous. liaisons when he has a little wig. with the crowd whatever those [ __ ] old wow. the worst script of all. time hello i'm here for the meeting. adjourned let's get to. the matter at hand they're always got matters. dude let's get to. the matter at hand there. it was a thing in the town. square that didn't go according to. john is not thing john excuse. me paul giamatti you really can't be adlibbing saying thing and also two scenes. ago you said okay. and that wasn't even in the vernacular. in 1779. dude you know what i [ __ ] hate yep is when movies in that are spoken in it's an english language. right and they take place. in another country yep and they use accents. gladiator of that place gladiator talk latin or i'm not well. i'm not watching just no. no no speak english without accents. oh right right yeah say dude. honestly a local accent i. know it's already [ __ ] in english i want it. to be all right what's up. bro where are you know. what i mean well that's a little far. no i mean it dude. julius caesar come out. and be like nah bro. kill him that'd be pretty. sick actually send out the [ __ ] lions dude. i would watch the [ __ ] of that. [ __ ] yeah hell yeah gladiator is just like are you not entertained. bro what the [ __ ] man. where my homies at yeah. wow wow you should have been in that i know i know i don't like that. thing why why accents it's like such bull. it's so oldtime [ __ ] it's just not it's like that's not a good. middle ground there shouldn't there isn't a middle. there isn't a middle ground or don't do. it do it in the proper. language just do it in your normal. voice i love to. russell crow when i saw gladiator even back when it. came out first when it came out. i was like that guy's going. to be a fat guy. you knew that right. oh you knew russell. crowe is going to. be a fat guy. and now look at him. man no no no hate he's a great. actor he's super talented yeah and he's a dude. so he could probably wet it. up no matter what weight. he is well yeah he's really talented. famous guy i never lack in that. department but he you knew. you knew he was just that's a guy. that's just so plump. yeah he was like already fat. basically even though he was cut. up and no but the the thing. i want russell court to. do and uh weirdly enough i've been saying this. for years and this is before. he got fat i want. him to get fat. and play like a father of a child. who's got like a lot. of like issues in their life and i want. him to like break. down crying in a couple. scenes if he was a really. fat guy and broke down. crying in scenes he would win. every award yeah you're right. you know what i mean. yeah you're right what's weird. is i didn't just think of that. right now i've been saying this for a long. time that is very weird yeah but isn't it. true yeah and he should have a buttondown shirt. and his belly should come. out of the bottom when he's crying. on the couch when he sits. the buttons come out a little bit. and his knees are higher. than his [ __ ] belly dude. right there dude the academy. where city party would show. up right at the scene. and be like excuse me i need to. and just give it to. him yeah it's true. he would be still getting. his hair sometimes his hair is long like wavy. it would be that big. right in the middle in the middle. yeah yeah yeah wow yeah is sydney. portia dead right yeah i think he's dead. maybe i don't know if he died. or not but whatever i mean. like i think so he might have died. if he died it was in the last three. years sidney poitier huh. that that last name is so common. oh he died dude he died. this year yeah but imagine meeting a guy. with a last name portier poitier it's poitiers. sydney what is that we should give each other advice. now okay okay don't wear so many chains no. run your neck that's not really advice well no no we need to. ask each other first [ __ ] dick. but i wanted to. give that advice for a while. now all right well you gave me that. it's also not so many it's two chains it's like two. chains well now you make me. feel bad no i'm not it's not. feel bad i feel fine. dude i'm iced out oh. good okay all right. i'll start okay jesus christ. i am working out. okay and i'm trying to. eat better okay and i have a hard. time staying within my discipline. yeah right so i want to. know if you guys have tricks to. help yourselves do it's hard. i do she does i do i've never had that. problem so he does well. what never had what problem. you don't never needed to. work out yeah why because i'm like [ __ ] ripped obviously i'm not but like i never really have gained weight. why not why have i not. gained weight why have you not why. do you not work out. it's good to. be active oh i mean i'm not. i would i would say i'm particularly. inactive but i never ever ever. like go to the gym. every once in a while i'll get on the [ __ ] treadmill or i'll go for like a long walk or something but i've never been like a root regular working out. person how come oh because i don't like it. i don't like doing it. yeah um and what was the last. time you ran oh actually kind of recently. like maybe two weeks ago. you're like i robbed. a bank what about um was the last time. you jumped jumped yeah i mean. just like jumped jumped onto. something that's working out well no but it's active. i don't know when the last time. i jumped on something. was what was that somebody did a pushup. i mean what the [ __ ] kind of questions. was it last time. you jumped i'm asking dude. uh uh on the stand. on the stand i don't. know did you kill her. um so look i think that um you have to. what i do is i don't [ __ ] try to. cut everything out and completely go okay. no carbs whatever the [ __ ] people do you know what i mean but um i make sure when the to. save i think this is actually. really good advice save. the eating like [ __ ] to. only your cravings right like wait till you crave. the ice cream and then eat the ice. cream don't just mindlessly do it. really realize if you want to. eat it or not or if it's just a your board. thing that's a huge step. for me because in the day. i don't get cravings. until until night but um but but if you ask me do you want a doughnut now i do want it but i'll be like yeah but i only kind of want it because it's here not because i crave it so save your junk food. until the cravings that's step. one and finding the motivation. to work out is really hard. sometimes but doing it as a routine. is best i used to. always do it at 3. 30 from 3 30 to. like 4 30 or from four. to five you know. and just [ __ ] doing it when the sun's nice and i'm out there i'm glistening. and i'm sweating i do. some outside and i'm doing curls. and my shit's cascading down my chest. and it's getting bigger as this. beef enough it's getting harder the be for the sweat beads to. roll down because what happens. my chest gets elevated. and i wanted to. get to the point. where my chest gets so elevated. that the beads just kind of sit there. do you know what i mean. dusting just [ __ ] straight up disgusting. the slower the beads. go down the hotter your chest. is popping out right. i don't know well i take your word. for it and that's disgusting. you might know but disgusting. um so that's getting into. a system of working out. and only eating [ __ ] on the cravings i think is the key. and uh that's when you can start. and then once you start seeing uh um results you're kind of off. to the races dude right. once you start seeing results because they say nothing. food doesn't taste nothing tastes. better than skinny feel skinny. feels and to those people it's like i don't know dude i don't know how many calzones you've eaten but like sometimes food is just so good right once uh but also you gotta you gotta see that in the mirror you gotta see those results and then you're like cool [ __ ] them calzones yeah you know yeah yeah that makes sense um oh so insecure uh i think that um i think that once i do start gaining weight i'm gonna be a fat fat fat [ __ ] you know i actually was driving here today thinking like dude what what is the decision like because here's the thing for me i i look you know i feel like i look fine i'm i'm fit enough but like i feel like dear if i was gaining weight i would have a decision to make and the decision isn't to start working out necessarily it could be but some people i feel like i would be like you know what i'm gonna be a fat guy yeah you know what i mean yeah actually check this out dude i choose to be a fat guy [ __ ] it yeah because some people are just fat because they don't work out and some people could just be like you know what i kind of don't mind being fat and i don't need to work out so i'm choosing to be [ __ ] lumpy where girls don't like okay yeah well so what you're saying what what is that like you're wondering what yeah what is it like to actually be like because i think that that would be my choice i'd be like i'd be a fat guy [ __ ] it i'm my personality's hot enough to where i can afford to be you know a fat guy you could make that decision right now if you want i know but i can't get fat you could here's what i actually wanted to ask you do you think it's weird that we actually have different very different body types we're both long and thin in general but like we've always had really different body types you know what's up with that like i actually thought maybe i'm wrong i actually mean this sincerely not like in a dick way i thought you absolutely could you absolutely could get fat if you if you wanted to and you can't i don't think i could get fat i obviously gained weight dick first of all to. say that i could get fat. if i wanted to uh why are you saying. that because i think you i think you've never seen. me fat even a little bit. i know that stop attacking me. i'm not me you're calling me.
