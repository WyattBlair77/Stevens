[ __ ] they're trying to. make it like tick tock. which it's not that it's a show. but this guy is now. on hulu and he's like doing the [ __ ] that he does. on tick tock. where he's like hey and he's wearing a wig. for no [ __ ] reason meeting a a patient. and he's like so we're gonna take that. uh that lump off your nose. and he's got like a pippi longstocking wig. on and it's like okay. but also this is surgery. right so it's different. if you're doing it for tick. tock than if you are actually. interviewing the people that you're gonna. give a bbl in a fireman's. outfit right and then they got the dads. dude there was one episode where they were so italian. dude i i really feel like italians speak to. me you know and i know that i'm italian. and i come from that [ __ ] like look i have a cousin. butch i gotta cut some butch baby. i got an uncle vinnie. right like these are my this. is my blood dude um so i really love. the italian like i don't feel that. connection with southern people but i wish i did because i love southern people right. but i love i love specific people right. like if somebody is saying something about like hey man. i got a [ __ ] landscaping business or something like i'm from [ __ ] tulsa i got a landscaping business i'm like that's so specific that guy is immediately my best friend. because i love it. right i don't know anybody with a landscape. business you love front lawns. bro if you love front lawns. and you're from tulsa i'm in right. i'm in because what the [ __ ] is that oh you're passionate. about it i'm in okay. you want to. talk about planting hibiscus or whatever the [ __ ] all the dude. i am so in number one. i'm in because i'm in because i can't. believe you want to. talk about that so much and i love your passion. and it bleeds from you but also we don't have. to talk about me my baby. right so um that's very hard for me. to talk about myself and i'm learning. and i'm getting through it. right a lot of stuff. that went on in childhood. wasn't necessarily uh you know. maybe you're gonna put the walls up. from what um but yeah so uh i don't know why. i started talking about all this. from dr miami but uh oh italians this. woman wanted to come in to. talk about um wanted to. come in to. get a note the people who are like come in and do all the plastic. surgeries at once god bless dude. right like just going in and coming out. just straight up a different person. god bless i understand. you don't want to. keep going in because you don't want. to keep getting knocked out. and [ __ ] obliterated with your you know but this woman got a liposuction you know her her boobs different and then like a bbl. and a nose job. which means you're gonna have to.

how old are you. when you imagine yourself as a child. i don't know like seven. and where are you what. do you mean where are you. as a sevenyearold if you were gonna if you as a 42 year old were gonna walk up and talk to. yourself as a sevenyearold where would you be like this though i don't know my old front porch. dude was in the trance i wasn't here's the thing. man i wasn't hypnotized but dude. the [ __ ] tears bro and it was it was it was transformative dude. it was so unbelievable. dude um yeah and i'm i'm i met so many great. people dude foreign yeah it was it. was it was crazy. to um think about every day. being here yeah in november. uh through december and it was just like i don't know what to. say about it man. food was trash the food. was [ __ ] trash get it together. um the food was trash. it was little literally like from like my little kitchen. where you're like do you. eat this part um but yeah man. you know a lot of those. guys in there um obviously like you. know you don't share names. and [ __ ] but like my god they were just like the the most uh to. make lifelong friends. at 42 and already know about it. like a weekend just like these are these are. my people it's hilarious. too like because like when you're when you're an addict. you're also yourself do you know. what i'm talking about you're you're you're also yourself. so what i went in as myself. what i thought right. and and like you're like all right. i'm gonna go to. this thing now i have an unbelievable. amount of fear in my. life i have an unbelievable. amount of fear in my. life ever since i was a little kid. just every second in my head. is something my you know. somebody's gonna abduct my parents. somebody's gonna kill my dad. somebody's gonna poison me right. just been there from as early. as i can remember did. not sleep through the night in my bed. until i was maybe 13 like i would run into. my parents room like just being honest. with you guys like running. my parents room my dad. would come and be like you gotta go. to sleep whatever dude just terrified of everything. and um you go in with the tapes. that play in your head. you know of i got this. but i also secretly don't have this. because i'm scared because like i'm lonely. i think i'm not worthy of love. and like whatever it is and i think i'm not. uh uh important do i matter. you know the real the negative. core beliefs that you have of yourself. and you go in and you think uh but i'm i'm me i'm different. i'm you know that whole that. that's poison to. think that you're different or above. it all or whatever. the [ __ ] it is but you walk in that way and then when you walk in with that fear me. me i should say me. when i walk in with that. fear and that all that compartmentalization. and all that stuff that i've been working with and working on. for 42 years to. build my [ __ ] walls up. um you just walk in and you see the other dudes who just they just they you. know what they look like people. they're just people they're people that you might see you know. where somewhere somewhere somewhere on the way. somewhere or maybe at the place. right or on the news. somewhere talking about some [ __ ] you know parade. that they're yeah i'm really happy. about that that guy. is there and some people look cool. some people look not cool. some people look fashionable. not fashionable some people look sad. some people are joking around. and you walk in and you just go i you have this. i had this thought where i was just i walked in and i was just like oh i'm like this. right you walk in with all. that baggage and then you will. see everyone else you see. a guy with like a a [ __ ] um uh a beijing soccer team jersey on and then a tall guy from kenya who's like six foot 19. with patagonia on and you're like oh ah i'm like this though and those were my [ __ ] people dude i didn't want to. well i don't know if i didn't want to. talk about it but it's just it. just went on it's it's what's happening. in my life and it's so important. to me you know. and i and i and i love those guys. and and the therapy there dude. was i mean it was like it. was like the therapists take their heart. out put it on the front of their boots and kick in the [ __ ] teeth for hours. a day that's what it's like they take their heart. they take their blood they take their tears. from whatever they've been working with because a lot. of them were addicts too or our addicts. and they just take their heart. out you go you sit in a chair. they put their heart on the [ __ ] tip of their boot and they just go sit tight. and [ __ ] just just kick in the goddamn teeth. and it is the most painful. beautiful thing and it's necessary. and it's hard um yeah it. uh it just something. i should have done a long time. ago and i and i didn't and uh i did. and uh i i i i i can't express enough. that if you are an addict or whatever. it is even if you think you got it. you know what i'm talking. about even if you think i got this or even if you've had it. it's so hard to. make um it's so hard. to make a a it a priority. mental health um and doing it. moving life you know to. do it for me. it's just it was too. important man like i i know i come on here. i'm this funny guy. but like you know like i i get these [ __ ] you know suicidal ideation and [ __ ] like that and it's just i the you have to. keep that [ __ ] in check and i [ __ ] i cry on [ __ ] podcast all the goddamn time but whatever um so you have to. get you have it's just such a good. idea man and and it was so cool. to hear the therapists and how much they care. about you and they they keep in touch. with me now for [ __ ] sake um you know i heard that the guys in there miss me now. so but that [ __ ] dr miami thing man is just like he's so annoying. and dude everybody knew what love you. like that whether it's plastic. surgery or [ __ ] you know [ __ ] is struggling [ __ ] is a [ __ ] you know it's all about growth. if you ain't growing you're dying. that's what i'm gonna run. for when i'm a mayor. the mayor of [ __ ] uh so i don't know dude the whole [ __ ] yeah i don't know man

the world. for me when i was a kid. and uh yeah and um and so i see calvin. and he's just i see him. be so you know sensitive and i just i don't want. to make the same [ __ ] i don't want. him to have the bad. parts you know um but you're gonna [ __ ] up your kid no matter what that's the thing. that's the [ __ ] hardest truth you know and the things also that your parents fall short on aren't even their fault a lot of the times i mean of course if they're beating the [ __ ] out of you it is but like to. hold space for people that. to for to. hold space for both things. things that you didn't get as a child. that you needed from your parents. and the fact that you still love. them and it's not their fault. it's just those two things together. are something that i really struggled with you know um because it's just going. to happen no matter what so i do. also because i live in fear get so scared. of [ __ ] calvin and uh you know [ __ ] him up um but i just love that boy so much man. um i love my family. so much and it's just uh the first thing. he said to. me when i got back. was he looked at me. and he goes like this. we call his we call his. grandma my my wife's mom kiki. first thing he said was he looks at me. because he woke up from it from a nap. or uh in the morning. right yeah in the morning. i woke up and and he looks at me and he goes he looks at me and he sees. it's me and he goes. like this let's go see kick his toys and i was just like that. is the [ __ ] funniest sweetest thing. and i said let's see dude. and then i he was like so like showing off. and being excited and i was just the happiest. i was just the happiest. man um yeah so i did take a break. because of my mental health. um and that was why and um i do feel a bit. refreshed and i am excited for my shows i haven't performed in a bit is going to. be a bit of a [ __ ] memory game um but yeah been trying to. potty train calvin which is. really [ __ ] hilarious uh he just he'll go he'll go on the little potty you know we got that little potty and [ __ ] for him uh i [ __ ] in there too it's a mess no i don't and um here's a little potty and he sits on it and he waits to. pee and he's just like waiting. and then he'll he'll go. it'll go and it'll jump up. and as he jumps up. he'll go i did it. and piss all over the floor. also and i'm like uh dude you're doing such a good. job dude you are doing such a good. job but you got to. stay there on the on the toilet. and he does again. he does a little bit. more stands up as he's i did. it and i'm like i got piss. all over me i'm just like you're doing. such a good job dude. you are doing such a good. job you gotta stay. on there i'm pooping i'm like that's actually pee but you're doing. it dude and then and then he's like i have to. poop and he goes on there. sits on the toilet for 25. minutes doesn't poop and i'm just wasting time. dude but i'm not though. because you know i'm teaching. them how to. party how to. be potty trained but it's so [ __ ] cute. and so funny dude. i'll actually sit there with him. all [ __ ] day dude i don't get bored we chat we talk about [ __ ] different things i mean mostly it's [ __ ] because he's leading it but like dude it's stuff that you know what it's important to. him how about that. how about maybe that's what he needs. so if he wants to. talk about [ __ ] purple crayons for way. too long which he does. sometimes we talk about purple. crayons if you want to. say it's crayon day even though. he's using a highlighter. then you know what it's [ __ ] crayon. day dude um but he'll just sit there. he hasn't pooped in there yet. but um you know he'll pee in there. sometimes and we'll take the thing. and we'll and we'll walk it. over to the toilet. dump it out and then it'll go he'll go. bye peepee and that'll run. back over there i can run. back over to the toilet. um but yeah dude. i went in last. night he he was he was up. till i mean put him in bed. at maybe nine something maybe ten. you know he sleeps late. because he's comic hours um but he uh he he didn't have his blanket. he was still bucking around. for until like 12 30. it's been. two hours and i'm like [ __ ] i i said kristen i was like should we [ __ ] go should i put put a blanket in there and she was like yeah yeah but the one blanket that he likes is the only blanket. he'll allow in the bed i mean. he's so me already he's two. and a half and just like he's got to. have the [ __ ] one blanket and she's like it's in the car. and i was like oh okay i'll go out. and get a car and get it. bring it i bring it. in and say hey buddy he says hi. i said do you want. your blanket and he says yes and i put the blanket. on him and i said how are you doing. you okay and he said yes and i said do you want. me to uh get in there. with you and sleep. in the crib and i was kind of like just saying it. and he said i said you do you want. me to come in he says yes and so i move so he moves. over i go in in the crib. and i'm sleeping with him. actually we have a picture of it. we can put it on the uh on the video. and uh and then i and then i wait and then i and then i'm i'm there. for about 10 seconds and he's looking at me. in the eyes and he goes. like this go away. stick dude and i said oh you want. me out and he says go away. foreign left um and he and he cried. a little bit but it's so it's it's weird. how you know managing. look he's a lot smarter. than i am in a lot. of ways he knows how to. manage emotions and let a lot better. than i do at least he [ __ ] feels him right that's the thing it's so hard to. actually know for me how i feel sometimes. i wonder if you're like that. like it is so [ __ ] hard like you know a guy [ __ ] is like oh something happened boom anger that's what i feel uh do you though what's under that scared. of [ __ ] and i'm angry. about it what's under that. heartbroken sad as [ __ ] and i'm angry. about it what's under that. well i'm happy and i don't want to. be happy so i'm mad about that. because it feels better. to be angry because that's where i live. and where do i live because of my anger. fear and why do i do things. that put me in fear because that's what i'm comfortable. with and i keep reenacting trauma. sad but that's the truth. because that's where i'm comfortable. i asked my therapist why. do i do things that jeopardize myself. and make me in fear and she says because that's what's comfortable. for you and that's when i think well that makes me. scared and that's when she thinks i know dude. because that's what's comfortable. for me oh yeah and thus goes. the cycle how do i break this. and only become happy oh we gotta work. through this ah but the thing is i don't want to. because it hurts because when we start. talking about things i mean. dude retrospect will candy coat everything. nostalgia makes [ __ ] taste [ __ ] real nice but what is it really dude. so tell me about you sitting on your porch. when you were seven years. old playing with the dinosaur. s [music] at last. falling sunny frozen mad world [music]. blood from the ice mad. world um yeah dude. and uh so did i rip these [ __ ] these pants are done. dude i'm done with these pants man. i got them fixed. 19 [ __ ] times and now i just kid they're so tight because they keep patching them up i'm done with them diesel. you made a piece of [ __ ] pants. um and they're my favorite pants. so great whatever dude. one of my therapists told me. that i should [ __ ] imagine myself as seven years. old me myself on the porch. and then bring myself to. my mom and my dad. and talk to them. and [ __ ] make sure that i could take care of them and then open up. literally my chest and open up. my heart physically actually because there was a door. on my chest and imagine it. and then imagine my sevenyearold crawling in there and closing. the door on them and i know. what no matter what i do. in my life he's also there. too and i'm like okay. but i imagined myself seven. years old not the size of jiminy. cricket so now i got this. big ass lumpy sevenyearold sitting in my [ __ ] chest just knees up in his [ __ ] mouth all crunched into. my chest and that's where i am. in this [ __ ] you know what i mean. trans state and i'm still crying. but i'm like hey it doesn't really. fit ah dude all bunched. up can this dinosaur dinosaur. king fit he wants a dinosaur. it doesn't fit in it. should have told me i i should imagine him. the size of a [ __ ] mouse sevenyearold in my chest and [ __ ] sevenyearold in my chest so uh yeah man gotta pee bad but gonna ride it out um is he still sleeping calvin. almost dropping my mouth. right there that's great that's great. dude i want to. get i kind of want to. get back on the coffee. train but i also kind of don't want to. get back on the coffee. train if you see me. i don't know man people give me starbucks. gift cards and [ __ ] of course that tastes like the back. of the cow's mouth but i get it. they're doing things to. be nice and thank you very. much fans i got meet and greets. and [ __ ] [music] um oh dude they make you [ __ ] set boundaries dude wow one thing i [ __ ] hate is setting boundaries i'll tell you that much you know why i want everybody to. like me and if i put a boundary on. someone and they don't like it. then they don't like me. hey dude i'm 42 and i just figured this. out you know what um so i had to. put boundaries on people that's what my therapist told me. that i had to. put boundaries on people that was like my assignment. and one guy that was like eating. in the [ __ ] dining hall. would uh [ __ ] pull his chair out. too loud and i'm like larry david's sitting. there i'm just like i can't how does this. bother me that much. dude i'm like a nonvet dude. i'm like a [ __ ] numb. vet when it comes. to noises dude i used to. go out with this woman when i was 32. and she hated loud. noises and it always bothered me. i'm like it's just a noise. and dude [ __ ] if i don't have that now is it a condition. loud noises look that up. loud noises you can't be around. loud noises i don't know. whatever the [ __ ] it's called audio sensitory whatever the hell dude he would roam the [ __ ] chair would come out. it would be like all of a sudden. an elephant just broom. and i ah and the guy's a [ __ ] navy seal. or whatever the [ __ ] he actually and so he gets up and does everything all loud nice guy handsome as [ __ ] and [ __ ] run and i'm oh hey bro haha right and he'd be like and then he would go like a fun guy and i'm like yeah dude i get that's the thing to. do as men but holy [ __ ] man i got a sevenyearold inside my chest and we don't like that but i swallow it you know because i'm me and i don't want him not to. like me and i'll sit i'll sit with it. okay i'll sit with it and uh so then uh i gotta set. these boundaries you know like two weeks. in they're like you gotta sit pounds. you gotta give somebody a boundary a day. and i'm like for [ __ ] sake all right i'm gonna give this [ __ ] boundary a boundary so i'm sitting there at the [ __ ] dining hall it's just me and he's at another table i like the guy he's a friend of mine gets up bro i go and i i stand up and i say hey hey uh but he says sup and i'm like um could you not uh could you not do that so loud with the chair when you when you get up it's uh it's it's so loud and he said huh and i said i gotta i gotta put boundaries on on people that they said i have to. practice putting boundaries on people. and he said that's not a boundary. and i wasn't really equipped for that. part so i said what do. you mean and he said well. a boundary is like. hey um when you do this. it makes me feel this. way and if you keep doing it. then i'm going to. have to do something else and remove. myself in this situation i was like oh okay. right i'm saying it wrong. um okay so when you um moved the chair. like that like a [ __ ] [ __ ] i didn't say that but i wanted to. but it was right. i was doing it at the therapeutically so i'm like when you get up. and do that you uh it it's loud. for me and if if you do do that. when i'm studying here and i'm i'm. reading books telling telling me how [ __ ] up i am and filling out the worksheets on how much of a piece of [ __ ] i am right and i want to. write letters fictitious letters when i'm writing pictures. letters to my mom. and dad and that i'm never gonna send them. because it's just an exercise. right as i'm writing a letter. with my left hand two minor. child on what what i might need. from him as a 42. year old man i'm i can't hear that. i'm gonna have to. go into the other room. um and uh and so so that's that and he said huh. okay um well i don't want you. to have to. leave the room so uh i will i'll be more conscious of it. man and um i try i won't i won't do it. so loud and i said oh thanks. and then it beat past. and i said i said out. loud i feel so awful. right now and and he said really and i said yeah. man i feel [ __ ] horrible saying that [ __ ] and he said why and i said i mean he's 40 i'm 42 and we're standing there and we just ate kiss poor halibut and cereal for dessert. because there's no sugar. cheerios by the way and and he says uh and i and he says why i i said because i'm afraid when i say that. you'll like me less. 42. he's 40. he's killed people in the ocean. he's an elite navy seal. i'm a dumbest [ __ ] comedian i talk about things like pants on stage and here we are looking at each other no let me paint the picture and i don't mean to. do this
