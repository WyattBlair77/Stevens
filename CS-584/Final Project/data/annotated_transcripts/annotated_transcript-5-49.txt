[ __ ] nobody's [ __ ] well they are actually when i go out on stage i don't know i don't like anybody that much you know what i'm saying i don't like anybody that much and i for sure don't like a team that much there's some [ __ ] on that team probably right how about that guy who [ __ ] up the game junior or whatever i can't do it i can't like i don't know also they're throwing a ball around i know i did a bit on incorrigible about this but i still feel that way go bran i did just to. see the instagram pictures. that these [ __ ] idiot girls are gonna take do it with their tits out favorite place. in la the lake show. and they're gonna hashtag it. so other [ __ ] fat [ __ ] sporks guys will see it and follow him and be like damn she's hot. the lake show the lake. no you i knew lebron was gonna be in la because the lakers. get everybody like the [ __ ] goddamn yankees do i'm surprised. that lebron didn't go to. the yankees that's what it. should that's what it would have. been that would have that wouldn't surprise. me if they were like lebron signs. 150 million dollar contract. for one year he's taking wolf's the guys name. johnny damon spot was it the guy. he was in and i mean. years ago right but he was a yankee. right that's how much i know about sports. lebron is playing with the yankees he is. going to be playing right. field because that's where everybody who sucks. goes he is going to. be playing whatever did jordan there's a centerfield because right. field can be can make up for it. and left field can make up. for it so he will be playing centerfield. the worst position and the yankees are paying. him and he's going to. have to cut his beard. because the yankees have a [ __ ] rule about long. hair or some stupid [ __ ] like that. [ __ ] organizations you know [ __ ] how sports teams are called organizations it's a game i don't know man hey what's up with terry crews what the [ __ ] is he doing man somebody grabbed your [ __ ] ah what are you doing putting on a suit talking into. a microphone about it. what are you doing gone. at a sip what are you doing. trying to [ __ ] gutter the supreme court i don't know where he is it's talking to. congress or some [ __ ] he gave. some speech on sexual. assault and it was about a producer. that did it that grabbed. his [ __ ] now granted that producer shouldn't do it that producers a piece of [ __ ] but stop acting like you're a survivor. you know why there's firemen you know. why people have been in tsunamis somebody grabbed your [ __ ] oh you had a bad day. a [ __ ] i had somebody grab my [ __ ] violently and it hurt. now it was an old lady. and it was outside the comedy. store look i love how terry crews was like when he held my genitals in my hand. he held he while he held. my genitals in his hand. was that he held the power. no he didn't you played football. ah dude smash him. oh he held your balls. smash him what up dude. if a guy grabbed my balls i don't care. if it's jesus christ. you get chris smashed you know. how hulk has hulk smash. i do chris smash i even. if it's beat the [ __ ] out of me. then but dude you're not grabbing. my nut cells the lady. why weren't you you're a big. powerful man why. didn't you what is this. world a look i i'm a i'm a terry crews fan man. i like terry crews i think that he's a funny. guy is good actor but if someone grabs your [ __ ] hey terry crews smash um i don't know some guy [ __ ] aren't you a guy when you're a guy aren't you just waiting for another guy to. do some [ __ ] to. you isn't that just kind of like what. being a guy's like when you're out. in public somebody bumps in here. all right [ __ ] here we go what the [ __ ] you doing this guy just stood there ah [music] aren't isn't that just what it is being a guy i don't know and i would how long ago was it two that that happened was he already famous i feel like y'all ready had some [ __ ] poppin maybe not terry crews police report on groping i don't know when it was but what wait here it is here it. is two years ago. he said and that was in the 17. 2017 i'd like he was already. famous as [ __ ] here he did the on that that movie with all the other action movies stars in it. i don't know man i mean. sexual assaults no joke obviously don't grab somebody's [ __ ] nuts i imagine a guy grabbing your nuts and not [ __ ] fighting him i don't know maybe i wouldn't if the guy was super i don't know i haven't been in that situation. or another guy grabbed my i don't think i have one other guy. grabbed my nuts like that. wow ya know hollywood is has a [ __ ] huge power. dynamic problem obviously look at how everyone seen. i mean that guy's going to. [ __ ] they just said he could serve life in jail huh. what a piece of [ __ ] that guy deserves it. you know it's just uh wow. imagine imagine being what did that's you. know that's the thing man. here's the here's the thing we in hollywood. i swear to. god i have this theory where if you're a guy. that's an alpha and you're just cool. quoteunquote your whole life. you're you have no reason. to be a [ __ ] because you just kind of were always dude that kind of you know heard yes and no and also got what he wanted and what he didn't want. you know nobody gets what they want. all the time but you were a guy. that just kind of like you got to. watch out for the [ __ ] nerds. like harvey weinstein was a [ __ ] dork. like he was a [ __ ] dork you know he was look at him. he looks like a [ __ ] brick wall. a puffy brick wall and like and like when you get power. you got to be real [ __ ] careful. with guys like that because then they're like no. i got the power and you were and they and a lot. of those guys have use it. they don't all abuse it. but these guys think that they can. do [ __ ] and get away. with it because of the fact that now they've got all this. power and they don't know how to. wield that power now i'm not. saying that guys who are quote unquote. cool guys don't do bad [ __ ] of course they do but there's something about that revenge [ __ ] that is just like and you can tell who these [ __ ] are man you can tell who these [ __ ] are like i don't know look at look at like look at chris hardwick you're telling me that now i don't know where i fall on that whole. thing because i heard her story and then i heard his story and it's like oh well she cheated on. him and tried to. get back with him and now you hear that. and you're like oh wait a minute. right after all that [ __ ] but you're telling me chris hardwick doesn't look like a guy that would be like i don't want you hanging out with other guy. friends you're telling me he doesn't look like that he's a selfproclaimed nerd. with now power that's what he's going. to do unless he seriously. tries to reflect on. himself and tries not to. be that person and is herself. reflective person but why would you be when you own. the internet it's too easy. and people wanted to. go to bat for him. too because he was this. like beta that became an alpha. you can't make betas alphas it. [ __ ] it up dude i was watching this thing on youtube. about a cuttlefish and there are these cuttlefish and a cuttlefish is this. ugly looking [ __ ] fish. no it's actually not even a fish. it's like a mollusk it's the same. thing as a clam right. and the mollusk the the the the the male cuttlefish are big. and they and they hide and the male cuttlefish. are big and so they take the female. cuttlefish and they [ __ ] them right. now some of the the beta. male cuttlefish aren't big and so here's how the male cuttlefish will [ __ ] the female cuttlefish the female cuttlefish will go under the male cuttlefish. for like protection and then the male cuttlefish will [ __ ] the females. because they're protecting them. some of the lesser the the the smaller. male cuttlefish don't have a chance because they don't women. don't women the females. they don't want to. go under the those guys because there's not enough. protection so the male cuttlefish. will disguise themselves as female cuttlefish go. under the male cuttlefish and then [ __ ] the females. under there ah you're telling that. they're getting crafty [ __ ] they're getting crafty. dude these are these beta. [ __ ] out there these are these harvey weinstein [ __ ] ass [ __ ] dude that's what harvey weinstein did he went under the real [ __ ] alpha he found in a backdoor way and he's pretending he's this guy and he's and he's taking what he wants it's the guy's fault. but it's also them you can't. reward these dudes for doing [ __ ] like that we can't put the camp make betas alphas you can't do it you can't do it i mean donald glover. is getting all in all. sorts of trouble now because he [ __ ] ripped that song why the [ __ ] are you surprised about that you put him on an untouchable pedestal if if i say i don't like donald glover people will just say i'm racist that's [ __ ] crazy now i don't not like donald glover i'm just giving the example that's [ __ ] crazy the fact i own oh he did that you can't make a beta and alpha dude i've been in the same room as donald glover like we made him an alpha you i don't know i don't know you can't you can't you know we don't i get it we don't live in the [ __ ] time we're the biggest strongest male matters anymore. it just it doesn't and that's that's good. by the way because we've figured out. how to care can't. your diseases you know. we can't care [ __ ] everything. but we can cure a lot. of [ __ ] that's because of smart. beta ass [ __ ] you know. they're alphas in their field. but if if every if the [ __ ] hit the fan and in nukes hit in nukes hit the world and there were a few guys left those guys get [ __ ] eaten and [ __ ] by the alphas i mean dude i asked my buddy who's a who's beta. ish i was like you if you if the whole world. fought each other everyone for themselves. 7 billion people in the world however. many people what place you'd think it. coming and he said the whole world. i said yeah every man. for every man woman for themselves. i said every man. for themselves and he's like i don't know maybe like 3 billion. that area and i was like well we got to. figure half of them. are women right so you could probably beat up. almost all of the women right. and he was like ok yeah. so he's like what about you and i was like i think i would come. in a billion maybe a billion too. you know and he was like see you think he beat up. and best and kill six billion. people in this world before. you die and i would say. maybe you know i mean you got to. take into account how many [ __ ] first of all half of them. were women i could i maybe i can't. beat up every woman but like a lot. of them so that's half. let's just say half okay. so seven point. six billion people in the world. that halves it to. three point whatever eight a lot of them are our babies how many babies are there i mean let's just say how many babies and then elderly i could beat all of those them up so a billion i mean how many al are elderly and under 14 i cuz i bet there's some 15 year. olds that can beat the living [ __ ] out of me. knowed it was probably. a [ __ ] fourteenyearold croatian out. there that can beat the [ __ ] out of me. i bet there's at an 11. year old croatian that. could beat the [ __ ] no just beat the [ __ ] out of me. and walk out like he just went to. the supermarket like there was no. fight involved croatians are [ __ ] jesus. christ dude the hardest guy i ever [ __ ] sparred with was a croatian it was like wrestling a wall and that's yeah so i would say a billion i would come in and maybe i would get lucky a lot of the time too i'm also probably smarter than a lot of people so i would maybe maybe a billion but like what once you get to. like the healthy places. like la i'm [ __ ] i'd actually probably died. way earlier in la but if i was in like midwest. city oklahoma i'd be although there are a lot. of big [ __ ] corn husker. guys out there god i wonder where you. know where a probably a good. place to be is if that happens. is like portland or seattle. with a bunch of like you know tech. guys and like glasseswearing dudes that are just like really open. about their feelings i probably probably probably fare. pretty well there and by the way. by the time you know the bigger guys. got to portland or seattle. i could you know but yeah that's that. yeah cuz i would say vancouver. or some [ __ ] but take out some big [ __ ] canadians man anyway well i don't know what we were talking about but you can't it's tough man when you start rewarding these beta [ __ ] you know there's just there's a pecking order you can't act like there's nothing [ __ ] i probably get heat for that but i mean i guess it's all supposed to. be funny but maybe not maybe i'm being too. serious i'm just [ __ ] who knows whatever [ __ ] it i listened to. the to the drake. album which i liked actually i thought. it was better than his last. few albums who gives a [ __ ] what. i think about a drake. album and like it matters. you know what you know. what drives me nuts. too is that like drake. or somebody or anybody any artist. will spend like years working. on something and then someone will be like it's pretty. good like he [ __ ] [ __ ] so like i'm basically doing the thing i hate like i'm not trying to. review the the i just it. drives me nuts when peoples and i say i and i i said this. and i think this but like it drives me. nuts when people say what i'm gonna. say but like yeah it was better. than his last two albums. like [ __ ] me who the [ __ ] am i to. say i don't know anything. about the drake lives this. [ __ ] you know anyway i but i did i didn't like the [ __ ] last two albums oh by the way it's okay to. say a kanye album sucks. because he takes [ __ ] seven days to. do it so go [ __ ] yourself with that eight days. he admitted he didn't write. any lyrics or didn't even. have the song write any lyrics. for eight days before the album. came out go [ __ ] yourself you know and these [ __ ] will just buy it it doesn't matter scoop that he poop poop poop they don't give a [ __ ] you [ __ ] i listen to. that kanye i'm and i was like all. right so but the drake. album is good man and i mean. he just makes good music. and but like it's so millennial. you know i mean [ __ ] forty five percent. of it is about instagram. like there's have you heard the album's have you. heard album he says like oh yeah. you like in pictures you like my picture. like there's so many lines. like that it was like you unfollowed. me and i follow and you got mad because who i'm follow. in like a few a little of that. is good but there's like basically a song called. instagram or some [ __ ] oh oh i saw the photos you was tagged in oh people have to. be talking about that by the way. about i was talking about instagram. a lot him he talks about instagram. so much on his album. oh i like your picture you like mine. i want to. make a rap you know he should have done he should have just made a song called. instagram and then it would have been yeah. and then it would have been just all taken. care of all of those. lines but how about the fact that he's making that die. i thought this [ __ ] was corny as [ __ ] actually he put up an instagram post where you can buy a scorpion jacket and put your name on it like and say executive. produced by yet but it's not executive. produced by you well so what does it. mean why would you you can buy. a jacket and engrave it or whatever. the embroider it i city. it and buy it for $150 and you can just put your name on it. and it says exact. imagine wearing a [ __ ] jacket that. says me measure me buying. a [ __ ] scorpion jacket drake. jacket supporting drake and about his. album that's fine but then in grey. and grow during it executive. produced by chris d'elia when i had nothing to. do with it except for streaming. it hat imagine even wearing that. [ __ ] jacket if you did executive produced. the album scorpion hey also i was. listening to the drake album. and i kept listening to. like 12 songs and then stopping it and then starting. it over again i had no. idea it was quoteunquote a double. album or whatever i didn't. know also there's no double albums. anymore because there's no cds. but b side a side. and b side there's no sides anymore. it's all streaming i had no. idea and then i heard [ __ ] ratchet happy. birthday and i was like huh. have you seen the [ __ ] video of dj. khaled dancing around what was the [ __ ] song. uh not just go to. the tracklist it was that high. that knows on the second side. night no not nice. for what in my in my feelings. so buzzy huh in my feelings. and then he's dancing around. dude dj khaled is seven years. old i don't give a [ __ ] you know who he is he's jack that.

forget about it and then you'll find out in like japan they have 47 versions of it and now you can play guitar hero. as blanca or ryu but it. was like a a video game. where you could play. as a good god it. was the it was the worst. stupidest [ __ ] video game i've ever seen i mean. the the the they had rock. band and dj hero. i mean hitting literally all you. were doing was hitting a button when a thing told you to. hit the button play the real guitar. some people were so good it's just learn. the real guitar get pus god these door. cast [ __ ] playing guitar. and i wrote i did a tweet. what

got 20,000 likes okay. now i didn't expect that and then i wrote it. is it is just like play. the real guitar instead it's an actual skill. and that leads to. more [ __ ] it's just like you know then some [ __ ] says a hundred percent on killer. queen expert mode do it. like yeah okay i i just like you're hitting a button went. and i know that's kind of what. all video games are but not really you can you can do other thing. in other video i don't like the games. were to tell you got to. hit a button when it says hit a button and that's that's all. guitar hero is it's just really fast. and colorful and it's really [ __ ] stupid and people were so good at it and that's dumb because play the real good but people were so good at it and not good at the guitar. and didn't know how to. play the guitar that's ridiculous. and i and so many people liked it. and retweeted it and then so many people were like oh you just weren't good at it. you had no [ __ ] because i didn't play it i don't even know if i ever tried it but i saw it a lot my roommates. would play it when i was younger. and dude oh my god oh better. pamiam i think that was on. it was that on it. no dude it was just like who knows. but you said this is it. basically what it is huh. but so fast boom boom boom boom boom you can't. dork central you're imitating something and as a matter of fact. dorks get good at the guitar. to become cool you're doing. the dorkier vert you're doing the dorky. version of what a dork. does that's how [ __ ] sad. your life is if you're good at guitar. hero you know what i mean. a dork is like how do i get checks to. get to pay attention to. me and then someone created a guitar. and now you've got these heroinchic tattooed up badass. [ __ ] that can play really well and get chicks and that's awesome. they figured out. a skill but you're doing what the dorky. fake version of what a dork. does do the real thing. it's amazing actually people just don't want to. go outside they just want to. be in their home imagine buying. that little bitchass guitar. imagine going and picking that up. and then it was like rock band. hero where you had a [ __ ] guitar and then drums and then a guy with a [ __ ] bass in anaheim harmonica it's like yeah how the house is a [ __ ] recording studio that doesn't record [ __ ] and instead of actual instruments you got toys i'd let you know what i would love if rock band was around look at these dorkyass drums that you can get for [ __ ] rock band ones red and yellow and blue and green oh god but like imagine if rock band was around in the 80s how many non musicians there would be that our musicians now like phil collins maybe wouldn't have existed because he would have just been like no i just like to. play [ __ ] hail to. the queen on experiment now i don't know [ __ ] i didn't mike genesis the group it's too busy in me room. press and read when a tv told me to. press read that's so bad dude i would love it dude you know there's probably so many people that you know what thank god there's probably so many people not making bad music now because they've just got hooked on guitar hero thank you guitar hero thank you rock band don't isn't there a dj one what i that by the way know nothing about that couldn't even if you gave me five days to. try and figure out what that. is and not use the internet. i wouldn't be able to. do it i'd be at square one. for five days dj a. dj isn't even a real thing. i mean unless you're producing the music. which is not what that probably dj. band rock [ __ ] dj is doing dj. hero look at how stupid it is look how [ __ ] dumb it is look how much that [ __ ] the whole thing's jerking around the little bitchass toy just mmhm derk off just go in your room and jerk off dj hero. on expert dude dj djing isn't even really a thing. due to what that's that. that's the key you do. to do the thing to. make a game out of the thing. that's already a game is. really it's really the thing. isn't that the [ __ ] truth. though that's why video games. are so [ __ ] big but i was but i guess call of duty are those like that's mom you know a mockup of how real war is it's not that's not a game i mean call of duty's a game obviously but not war obviously. but like a man rock band. i can't get over how dorky that. is i thought about that. after i tweeted it and for a good hour. and a half i was just thinking about. how [ __ ] dorky that is and i was laughing. by myself rolling around. in my car still laughing. about it you know. you [ __ ] don't get it dude. i laughed by myself all. day long i see people in convertibles i laugh. i i see a guy. wearing a [ __ ] stupid bandana and sunglasses at the gym. i laugh i laugh i don't hide. it i laugh i go. next to him cuz [ __ ] em dude if you're gonna wear that you get the reactions nobody ever comes up. to me and says what are you. laughing at to that that blows. my mind guys being guys. oh my god dude what's that. dude there's a [ __ ] soccer player name. some basic a sebacean well. that's funny one fire. just pulled up a guy who tweeted. me so basic wow. more than one people did it. the cult is strong. man the cult is strong. wow i just can't uh alright what else we got here i don't. know did you guys see that. movie head were hereditary everyone's flipping. her out about hereditary did you guys. see it it it's we're getting to. the point where horror movies. and you know it. kept my interest in all. that [ __ ] and we're just again to. the point where horror movies. like are just like doing the things. that horror movies have been doing. like you like the like how many times can it be interesting. where you think you see. something dark and then you turn it. on and then there's the guy's not there. anymore or how many times are they gonna do this. shot were the persons on. the ceiling like this looking backwards. at the guy how many times i get to. that oh and uh oh and a creepy. kid again a creepy. kid again only this time. it looked the kids face. it looks weird or something i don't know. what would the kids like it's a little offputting. the face of the kid. maybe i shouldn't say that. because it's a kid really good. acting in the movie though. i just like what what is. up with the [ __ ] horror movies just having a creepy. kid and then you got to. [ __ ] have the guy those are the scenes you got to. have you gotta have a creepy. kid and you gotta have the the scene. where something is in the dark. and then you turn it on and it's not there. anymore and not only does but yeah and not only do you not notice. does the does the character. not notice the character thinks. they noticed something and they turn on the light. and they see it's not there. and in their head they're like oh it was nothing. but us as audience members. knows we know that's that. there was a person there because it was there. and so it's like it doesn't make sense. because you would [ __ ] know do it you wouldn't think you saw something but also it wouldn't happen. in real life you'd [ __ ] if there was a person there to. be a person there hey but there were some freaky and scary. moments though but the way. people are flipping out about the movie is making is like come on it. i'm not saying it's bad but come on it's got all. the things that horror movies. would have and why is the girl. why is the lady mint make. miniatures what is that all about it. i didn't understand maybe i'm the dummy by. the way but there was like no. reason for that like she literally was just the scary. [ __ ] would happen and then she'd just be like painting a small house and setting up stickfigure or dolls and one time she was setting up a doll. [ __ ] or holding her titty and and feeding it to. the the daughter or something. why i had nothing to. do with the movie it was just creepy. i guess like don't make [ __ ] creepy just to. be creepy i'm just getting to. the point i don't even want to. see movies anymore i just want to. look at [ __ ] instagrams. of dogs seriously dude i could stare at a dog. like it's a painting [ __ ] art i want to. go to a museum where. there's just dogs around and you just look at dogs. and now i know that that's a pet shelter. but also it's not i want to. have the dogs but just even pictures of dogs. they're so good man i followed this golden retriever account. on instagram and it's on man. i watch that [ __ ] and it is on i watch it. like it's a [ __ ] i look at it like people look at salvador dali paintings. i watch it like it's [ __ ] the show the affair. you know on showtime never seen. that show god women love that show. the affair right women love shows. about cheating god women love shows about cheating what is that right cuz guys are usually the ones. that cheat but what. is it about women. that love shows about cheating you know why it's because their relationships most. of the time all relationships when they get older. they become excellus and girls won't cheat. but guys will but girls will like watch the shows. and be like i want that. that's like that's pretty funny. actually like i mean girls. cheat too of course. but not as much i guess. right i don't like when guys are like oh yeah but do girls. cheat just as much. as guys that no they don't. dude no they don't they don't. even cheat as close. to as much as guys. do guys have all this [ __ ] sperm. in their balls and need to. get it out you know. girls don't have anything to. get out the girls. have to release one. thing a month the eggs. guys have to. release both guys got calm guys. on calm guys want to. come guys on come and then cut to. the the jeff the of the [ __ ] blonde hair guy blinking. guys won't come all the time. i'm doing it on the video. podcast it's a [ __ ] to. tell people listeners that i'm doing on the video podcast. i'm gonna start doing that meme. in real life [ __ ] that i'm doing that. meme in real life from now. on when somebody says someone we go. got a look at the video. podcast for that babies um i love i love looking at dogs and you'll never take that away. from me dude you'll never take that. away from me i'll look at cute. dogs and there are some ugly [ __ ] dogs out there and i will not look at those afghan hounds are you kidding. me those dogs are so ugly. i'll tell them to. the face i'll look at a [ __ ] afghan hound and i'll say you're an ugly.

[ __ ] in my life. like i would never spend a waking second. on how how would you better. this world but i've definitely thought of would i rather. have it like i've i definitely already have. thoughts on shitty voices. and shitty laughs so when you ask me. something like this i got banging the dang at. a dang it dang it. a day in my head. i'm going well i know about this. chank chank chank chank chank. here's what you know how eminem is like he's like he just know he has a database. of what rhymes it's not. that he's like figuring out what. rhymes on the spot i already. thought about this [ __ ] cuz i think about things that are nothing all day. long okay would you rather. have a shitty voice. well [ __ ] have any shitty voice [ __ ] sucks because nobody can take it seriously and if you want to. invite people to. a pool party you're in the instinct. is no and you can't get a lot. of people at your pool. party if you have a shitty. voice unless you've built yourself a great life. and have a great house. and you know take good. instagram pictures or whatever. the [ __ ] but if you just have a shitty voice and you're just some guy you can't have anybody at your pool. party cuz imagine that do you want. to come to my pool. party no man you can. be talking like that there. well that's my voice cool. give me another address but if you have a shitty laugh. you know what you do. if you have a shitty laugh. you ruin everybody's good. time that's what you do. having a shitty voice is fine. because you'd know what you're gonna. get right when you meet the guy but if you have a shitty laugh and you're in a movie. theater watching austin powers. or whatever and all of a sudden. you're that [ __ ] that's like ah [music]. you [ __ ] 350 people in the ass. you [ __ ] him out of 1250 yeah there are people who laugh like that i've been in rooms. where people laugh i mean. i've been in obviously every night. i'm in a room where people are laughing. saqqaq [laughter] every night i'm staring at [ __ ] hoards of people laughing. its [ __ ] i've been in the rooms. where people are just like yeah. and i wanna [ __ ] i want to. ask him to leave. but you can't because that's the lab. but some people like lay into. it those [ __ ] that lay into. their [ __ ] [ __ ] laughs those people are the worst and they just become the the show i think i'd rather have a shitty voice cuz i don't want to. ruin people's good time i'd rather. not have the good time. because people don't want to. hang out with me because i have a shitty voice. but man you know. what i wouldn't want though. a guy that has like a high voice. like that like would be awful. dude if you don't have a [ __ ] low voice as a man. it sucks a lot. of girls won't like you man. and that that one was okay. oh that's a chick asking it. actually that's pretty funny that that. yeah okay so oh no. this is a guy or a girl. if it's a girl it's an okay question it's a girl. okay so it's an okay question i think do guys. look at folk but you know. the answer though already do guys. look at photos of themselves. and say damn my dick. looks good the way. girls do about their tits evan claire well. i mean they weigh less. you know i would never put i would i would never think. i don't think i've ever looked. at my [ __ ] area before posting a picture but maybe some guys do maybe gay guys because they wanted like attract other gay. guys but like women don't really look. as a general rule women. don't really look at [ __ ] areas. and think like gosh i gotta suck. that unless you're a complete.
