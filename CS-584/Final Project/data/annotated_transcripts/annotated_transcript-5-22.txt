the taint of the holiday season. between christmas and new year's. eve because nobody does [ __ ] and it's like in between the balls and the anus. because the christmas is christmas. has balls and new year's. is the [ __ ] anus or christmas. is your [ __ ] [ __ ] and then new year's is the anus. anyway it's a family show. but it's a taint the holidays. and all bets are off people show. up they're

horrible but that's how everyone kind of is on the taint of the [ __ ] holiday season and then and then so it's january 2nd. so january 2nd now. and i went to. go to the coffee. bean to get my thoughts. together for the podcast didn't really do it. always say i'm going to. do it but instead i just peruse. instagram and twitter and see what people are saying. about me it's a sad. so actually what happens. do i come up with ideas. yes do i do it in the time. i have a lot of myself. to do it no do i do. it all week yes do i sometimes. write them down yes do i write them. all don't know do i

change no i am who i am babies. and that's what this podcast. is about it's about being who you are. okay it's about being who you are. it's not about changing is it. about growing a little bit. but it's mostly about remaining. who you are and people barely change no matter. what yes do people think i'm really gonna make a difference i'm gonna make a changes. or just do they know. it's all good kind of but anyway do it. i was at the coffee. bean and limit i see something dude. this chick came out it. came to the coffee. bean now she had her onesie. on now immediately what i thought. of is

[ __ ] so would they just get out of a pool what are they in a [ __ ] cryo chamber. ah hey kid he in a cryo. chamber anyway dude yes the answer to. that is yes and you're my child. so anyway what was i was i talking about even uh oh i'm breakable but before that i don't. know it doesn't matter but sixth sense. yes alright anyway anyway. my special came out or my my thing. my episode of comedians of the world. and it the response. has been awesome i'm really happy. about it really happy. about it and it's very cool. netflix put out a comedians of the world. thing i even tried to. i even tried to. watch some of the comedians of the world. in german just to. see what it would be like and it's [ __ ] interesting dude you will have to. watch it in subtitles. which means you know it's not. really as good because you got a the delivery. and [ __ ] is all is important. but it's interesting to. watch and it's cool. too it's it's cool. too i don't know it's cool. to see all that [ __ ] but anyway net netflix put up 47 comedians around. the world doing standup. and i am one. of them the episodes and if you haven't seen it. turn it on yet. a lot of people are saying like i can't find it. it's because it's under comedians of the world. and i put it on all over. my social media so just also try a little harder. you know people want [ __ ] spoonfed they're like can't find it they'll type in ch. not here it's not here. chris rock came up ok watch that then i don't give a [ __ ] you know i don't want to. have to babysit you but watch it. and then and then but the responsibly good i shot. it uh about maybe seven months. ago six months ago. and i never know what i you. know after i shoot it. i forget about it like i haven't done. that routine since then around. then maybe i did it a little bit. after that like for a week. but then i get bored. of it because i know it's coming. out so i don't want to. do it anymore. so i talk about australia. and my trip to. australia which i actually talked about on the podcast. a little bit but i turned it. into material and then put it on stage and it was in an intimate. venue there like two. 200 people there was really. cool and and i'm glad the way. it turned out i didn't watch. it again but i just saw a little bit of it. because i was like how did this even. turn out you know and i'm happy. with it but people people seem to. really like it i never know. what the [ __ ] people are gonna say the internet's a weird man. people say everything i mean. somebody is somebody i was just looking today. i got a i can't i got a stop looking. i don't you know. yeah right you know you're talking and you never know. and someone to. do you so much. that you never saw you. can do anything so i basically i saw this. person tweet was super bummed that i saw you do this. set a year ago at house. of blues i it by i don't understand. how some people do say stuff. like that and i don't get i don't understand. what they think standup. is like you have to. you don't just go onstage. and wing it do they think that and i i think they know. that right they have to. know that you don't just go. onstage and wing it so because i know buddy can be that stupid nobody can actually think that so do they think you work on it. for two weeks or for a month. or three months or what because that's not what happens. first of all and i'm not even trying. to brag i put out material. quicker than anybody i mean there. are people who put up material. as quickly as i do but nobody really does. it is quicker than a year. my last presser came out. less than a year ago. right yeah it came out. like 10 18 right. or was it over ii. i can i never know that. [ __ ] [ __ ] yeah i don't came up 2018 it came out in june was it 2017 it's just okemah okay so came out a year and a half. ago really yes that's what okay. so what is it now. 2018 so okay so a year and a half. ago and on top of that. will this will add to. it i'm doing a complete. new set from the thing that you can. see on netflix so that's one. hour two hours two and a half hours. there's crazy hard to. count my fingers for two. and a half but two and a half. hours of material in less. than two years okay. i mean people are doing it. that quickly nobody doing it. quicker than that so what do people think i want to. know what i want to. know what those people and it's not the majority it's the minority. that don't understand how it standup. works but what how how much what do you. think i want to. know what i want to. know somebody out there who's listening. to this or if you have a friend. or something i want to. know what they think it's like cuz i retweeted that. person i was like yo you're [ __ ] an idiot like i worked on this and cuz i only worked on i worked on this not only but i worked on the set the netflix set that just came out in january second i worked on it for eight months. i worked on it. december january february march. april may june july. is when i shot it. so that's eight months. that's you know long enough. but but that's you know. that's long enough and then i dumped it after that. so i want to. know and i don't even mean. this in a defensive way i don't mean. this in a [ __ ] because i think that most people think that that's that that kind of a person. that says that is just an idiot. because they don't know how to. stand up forks but i want to. know if you are that person. what it actually what you think standup. comedy is because there's literally no standup. comedian unless it's a crowd work set. that you're going to. do that just comes up. on stage and make [ __ ] up for their standup. routine unless it's you know. no i don't i mean i literally don't think it's ever. happened in the history of standup. so anyway and if it did it. will be horrible oh it would be horrible. anyway oh if you are that. person let me know it. but thanks for watching for this. special really because i think that it. you know it's very cool. that you'd you'd continue to. support me and i do work. really [ __ ] hard and it's always nice to. hear that people are enjoying what i'm doing. when they do and so thank you. for that and you know. some people say some really [ __ ] humbling [ __ ] like and it really like i know i give off this air of like i don't give a [ __ ] but i do i really do give a [ __ ] about what you know about about my work and and so if people are you know i mean some people say nice [ __ ] like all you know i got battling depression i this and that the other thing and it's [ __ ] cool to. make up a laugh like that. and that's it that's all i have to. say about that it was weird. how the this was peeking. in netflix the other thing. that was netflix took down. an episode of the the patriot act which is. crazy to me i understand. why they did it you. know i think they thought there were legal. ramifications and the lawyer that they were talking. to their lawyers and said they took it down. because the government in saudi arabia said that. they didn't want it in their country. because they were making fun. of the crown prince or whatever. but man i just think that that's what i don't understand. is in saudi arabia so the saudi. arabian government is i can't make fun. of the [ __ ] prince so we're gonna ban. this episode what they don't. realize is that's oh that i guess. they don't realize it it's just gonna make people. watch it more yeah they only banned it there yeah in saudi arabia but like but it's gonna make people want to. watch it more it's certainly gonna make people outside of saudi. arabia look it up. and then in saudi arabia you can still. see it on youtube. youtube was like nah [ __ ] you guys we'll live it up so what the [ __ ] its if i say hey don't if i said right now dude don't listen episode 40 in my podcast the next thing you're doing is going to. look at 40 of my [ __ ] podcast after you might even not finish this one iii don't how could you be that stupid and be the [ __ ] government ah lots of stupid governments out. there put that on my [ __ ] tombstone lots of stupid. government's out there so yeah. i don't know dude but anyway shout at this. hasan minhaj who's great. at what he does and and the patriot act i tweeted. the link or no. i didn't tweet it. but i was trying. to find the oh no. i did tweet it i tweeted. the link on the youtube. for that that episode and i was like if you're in saudi. arabia arabia specifically enjoy this. i mean dude it's just so stupid. i love how people get so outraged. about the censorship to. the censorship thing like it's not really. that bad if you think about it. like i mean in saudi arabia it. is but an american. people are like nervous about it. being in america like yo people can say whatever. the [ __ ] they want and then people can be outraged at whatever. the [ __ ] they want that's it that's it that's how it is yeah i'm gonna [ __ ] say what i'm gonna say you're gonna get mad okay cool that's america and then i'm gonna say more [ __ ] i mean unless you're [ __ ] that guy who got banned from youtube alex jones right but that's just youtube they're banning it that's not america saying he can't do it he can do it god that guy that guy looks like he [ __ ] spills mayonnaise from a sandwich on his [ __ ] face all the time alex jones that guy couldn't look more like he has [ __ ] mayonnaise and mustard. on his shirt more. than that more than anyone. else in the world like your uncle. we're like yeah you got some on your face. and he just wipes. it to the other side. that's what alex jones looks. like i don't know you know. it's weird to. think about and i was think about this. year that there is like how crazy the time. has been in america and then how always i was talking to. my dad he was like dude. the 60s and 70s. early the 50s and 60s. and 70s he's like we thought the world was gonna end then he was like we didn't have the internet so we didn't know it every second of the day i was like yeah i mean it always seems like the world's gonna [ __ ] end you know it was always seemed like member this song we didn't start the fire everyone thought the [ __ ] world was gonna end during that like during that time too and that was the 80s that was when [ __ ] was [ __ ] i mean you don't even hear much about how the world was about to. end in the 80s but everyone thought. it was gonna end then did. everyone always thinks the world's gonna. end i think we're gonna be fine. here's the thing eventually we're not gonna be fine. but that's gonna because some [ __ ] global [ __ ] naca system you know what do you call it like like some [ __ ] climate [ __ ] we're gonna have to. move to mars. or some you know. it's not gonna be because of war. will always figure it out. or people will be dying. but america i feel like generally if you live in a big. city because you always hear all these big. city people that are just like oh what's the happening. to the world you'd do the same. [ __ ] every day you know i'm talking about how is your life changed if you just live kind of in chicago. and you're just chillin you go. to work you [ __ ] go to. sleep you party you come a little bit. and you have a sandwich. unless you lost your job. because of what you know. what the [ __ ] going on i understand. that but like you hear all. these people complaining in hollywood. and it's like it what i don't. know i not [ __ ] know like somebody [ __ ] somebody else just be like yeah it's [ __ ] crazy what's happening in the world the world's changing. and then they just ski that down. the mountain on vacation and you're like what. by the way how i would say how bad like i was trying. to think about skiing. i can't remember was talking. about this with but they were like have you ever. skied not as i [ __ ] yet. one other kid until i realized what the [ __ ] am i doing standing on blades on ice. because if you told skiing. is the is the richest. whitest [ __ ] like if you can like um it's so white to. have a great life. and then to do dangerous. things for the [ __ ] of it that's why i always say escape rooms. are the whitest things it's like oh [ __ ] pretend we're trapped when people are really trapped you know but like skiing dude is so white it's unbelievable. first of all you have a [ __ ] lift take you to. the top of the mountain. you [ __ ] okay climb up [ __ ] get a [ __ ] ice axe climb up you [ __ ] [ __ ] alright so you get a chair you get a chair in the [ __ ] sky to. take you to. the top of the mountain. you goodfornothing [ __ ] alright then you get to. the top you've got [ __ ] thousanddollar blades on your feet. [ __ ] and then you fly down a mountain it takes four seconds and the rest of the time you've got to. take that lift up ski. there's not enough [ __ ] action in skiing. you go down the mountain it. takes four seconds and then you're on the lift. for [ __ ] 12 and a half. hours it's like the flight. to australia [ __ ] hey dude take those god anytime you got a hold poles to. get somewhere stop you lazy [ __ ] get a nice axe. about how [ __ ] do people look when you get off the lift by the way. you can't do it cool. just standing up and getting off. the lift you couldn't look. more [ __ ] than that you know why because you're going the same for like a few seconds you're going the same speed. that's why you're on the lift. at a certain speed and then you get off. the same speed we're watching a video right. now where a guy got stuck. on the lift and the guy. jumped out to. into like a safety. bag it's just dude if skiing. didn't exist okay and somebody was we were at. the top of the mountain. no we were at the bottom of a mountain. and somebody was like hey let's go. to the top and [ __ ] slide down. and put these blades on each foot i'd. just be like hey man. what that's dangerous as [ __ ] why. would we do that and then the guy. looks at me and says fun. i go like this you're out. to lunch bro you're you know what you are too. wide you know what you are. too wide you know. what you are you're not. white you're white when people [ __ ] do that when old guys think they're being correct by. going white those kinds of guys. same kinds of guys who say. jesus instead of jesus white. gross hey if you say white you have bad. breath did you know that. you do so and then and then they got and then they got a [ __ ] lift to. take you up dude. it's not a sport if you got to. take a lift period. that'd be like if somebody hit a [ __ ] homerun. and then they got on a lift. and went all around the bases. run [ __ ] run two people falling down on skis and then snowboarding dude i went skiing until i got in until i went on a jump and then i did of what they i did the full scorpion which the back of my [ __ ] heels almost touched the back of my head because my chest had a [ __ ] jump and i literally thought up this is it gonna be gonna be dead now this reveal. i i was like up. guess i got to. give my pog collection to. someone it was then it was around.

about [ __ ] drake is that his [ __ ] is about i like more than one thing about drake i by the way i liked her i'm a drake fan straight up but he is like one of the only rappers that's that big and it's because of the music you know i'm talking about like it's because of his music it's not because of shoes it's not because of fashion it's not because a what he's saying in the [ __ ] on twitter it's not because of you know who we married or his family drake's just [ __ ] putting out good music but these guys like kanye and even me go so i mean which peoples they love the music it's just liked it but there it's about him by you know the mingoes bought this chain he goes did that or [ __ ] quavo is breaking up with the girl or by the way he's a guava that's going out with cardi b one of them i think it's quavo dude when he went to. the [ __ ] he's just a creep. creepy guy actually like he went to. she she went to. was it that rolling loud. was she was headlining it that in she was like the first female. performer ever ever oh no it's offset that that. dates are it doesn't matter. you know at all oh is. it quoi here's something that's never important. hey is it quavo or offset. either you know who's dating. cardi b either of its oats quavo. hey you know what no. it's not it's quavo i don't give a [ __ ] quavo you know. quavo is [ __ ] you enough then enough it's quavo yeah. where we fran's at the french. version of it were we in [ __ ] france. am i on a veranda. anyway offset hey dud man she's dating cardi b were married to. her and he can't stop cheating or whatever which is hilarious. it's not hilarious but so she she was. like the headliner and then he came with a sign. and like interrupted and was like i'm sorry. like dude you're not like this. isn't a [ __ ] john hughes movie like just if the three members are directly related and were raised together. quavo is takeoffs uncle an offset is cuevas cousin. i mean head dude. okay so hold on let me. read that again imagine trying. to make sense of it. okay huevo is takeoffs uncle okay so cleveo if qwave always takeoffs uncle then that means takeoff dad it's maybe takeoffs dad's brother okay and offset its cuevas cousin okay okay you know what honestly to. all that okay because i literally learned. something on january. 2nd that was the least important. thing i learned all year. i didn't know they were related. though that's pretty cool i guess. also how is he is uncle when they're the same. age you know black guys will be like my uncle's younger. than me white guys too though. you know white guys like like like like you southern. white guys they'll be like hey i'm 35. yeah meet my uncle and uncle be like hey i do poopy and you're like oh that's not your kid. not he'll now my dad. he's my dad's brother he'll. now he's my dad's brother. he's four i do poopy yeah but my dad. what happened was what happened. was my dad got remarried married. nutted in a girl and then had that baby. uncle so it's my uncle he kind of keeps me. in check tells me what to. do and then i wipe his ass. when he shits his diaper. oh god you sorry i got to. take my uncle into. the other room they made a stinker anyway. hi my grandpa my grandpa. hey this is my grandpa. he's 9 what the [ __ ] how does that. even make sense heya cuz i'm from the real. seth and i'm a lot. of [ __ ] asians don't do that. at all asians have straightup lineage. it lineage that just [ __ ] works. the [ __ ] out and let me tell you something too if you're asian and your greatgrandfather isn't alive you're not asian because asians have those [ __ ] alive and they live with you two japanese [ __ ] 35% of japanese people their greatgreat grandpa is alive and they're a hundred and one and it goes like this their great great grandpa's 101 their great grandpa is 84 their grandpa is 60 their dad is 40 and then they're 20 and that's just how it is man and then they also have a kid that's [ __ ] floor and that kid has a greatgreatgreat grandpa so that's asian is [ __ ] and they don't and they and they only they never take advice from whoever is younger than them they always just take advice from whoever's the oldest
