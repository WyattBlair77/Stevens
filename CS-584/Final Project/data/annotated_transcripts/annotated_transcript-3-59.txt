[ __ ] clogged up and i was like it's because of the algae you know guys die. like this if someone had like a little piece of diarrhea. on their anus and went in the pool. everyone dies did you know. that if you have a little bowel if you have a little piece of diarrhea. if you do diarrhea. i have a question. who has a little piece of diarrhea. people who do diarrhea. i mean i've done. diarrhea yeah do you think you'd get rid of all of the diarrhea. i don't [ __ ] damn well dude no you need to. take a shower after your diarrhea. so anyway i i went i i i don't have diarrhea. but i'm like i don't know if anyone in my house. has diarrhea i have a son. right he could i mean. you actually you probably know. if he has diarrhea yeah i know. but also he could like i don't even know. what it looks like if he like sometimes. kids have diarrhea like a little bit you know like kids. are always like some kind of sick. right so i'm like i don't know so i'm like so i'm like are you sure. it's okay and she's like yeah. trust me it's fine. and i went in the pool. and then the next day. i woke up you know. now i realize it's allergies. but it was [ __ ] crazy and i was like the algae in the pool gave me [ __ ] i'm gonna die. and she was like you're not and then kristen and her were laughing. at me but dude. whatever man why can we get back. to why a little bit. of diarrhea kills a bunch. of people because if you have a little bit of diarrhea. in water and then it [ __ ] and then you leave and then in a week. i mean that bacteria goes. nuts man it's like ibiza. for for algae but don't you have a [ __ ] cleaner in the pool like a thing yeah but you needed to. be the ph balance. and also the chlorine. you don't have a [ __ ] pool this sounds too dangerous and there's a chlorine yeah. if you have diarrhea. you just don't go in the pool. but no one knows that rule. yeah yeah you they do dude. have you ever seen apartment. complexes when they're like don't come. in there was a diarrhea. catastrophe or whatever the [ __ ] the [ __ ] yeah for real in apartment they're like please do not come in the pool we have to. really figure this out because diarrhea. has been in here that's what public. pools dude yeah man they people. die off that [ __ ] you go take one you think you're gonna have a nice summer. day and you walk out. with a little diarrhea. in your ear you're dead. because diarrhea doesn't just go. in your mouth it goes in your ear. it's in your brain it's all. [ __ ] up man the bacteria goes nuts. it's ibiza in there forever. what killed you murky obesity. what killed your friend uh diarrhea. that wasn't my friend i just read. it i know i'm doing it. like like it happened in the world. in the wild what killed your friend. diarrhea yeah that's the saddest way. to die on pools. it'll say it says persons. having currently active diarrhea or. who have had active diarrhea. within the previous 14 days. do not enter the pool. 14 days yep 14 14 days yeah 14 days dude that's two weeks they should just say two weeks. honestly yeah it sounds so much. worse 14 days for a few. weeks say a few if you have a diary so you mean. to tell me if someone had diarrhea. 13 days ago everyone's dead. it could still be on their [ __ ] ass. it's the amoebas and [ __ ] you know. how small they are. you don't know anything. when someone says i'm the one who's [ __ ] educating you about. diarrhea's impossible when someone says it's the amoebas and [ __ ] rest assured they don't know what the [ __ ] they're talking about i do it for the layman's dude like there's a lot of scientists that watch our show obviously but a lot of more way more laymen so i'm like [ __ ] telling people yes about the amoeba and shits so the laymans go like this oh okay the layman's yeah okay so anyway yeah if you have diarrhea 13 days ago and you take a dip and there's no cleaner in the pool everyone dies yes so it's hiroshima and word to. the wise don't diarrhea. and swim anytime soon how much would it suck. if you were working out. for that summer body getting a nice tan. summer was coming it's the first hot. day you know and you're just like oh can't wait to. go to my pool and then you realize [ __ ] man. 12 days ago i had diarrhea. i don't think that if you're sanitary you. need to worry about that. who who diarrheas and doesn't shower. for 13 [ __ ] days who's doing that. you're not it's not not showering i'm. just saying there could be a little piece diary is really. small dude diarrhea amoebas are really small. diarrhea in the murky water. yeah man pick up the movie. on the air out where the rub. still leave it like that. i heard your voice so bad. i know the little amoebas. in in [ __ ] murky ibiza. i know what bo don't. know and then another diarrhea comes. touch them up and go and then it gets in your ear. and you go uh oh why do you die. dude that's what happens. start lower because it's right. no no no no no no no no no no no i guess. so and then [ __ ] uh touch them up. and go in the ear. and then you go uh oh and then you run. to the bottom and then you're [ __ ] with your legs up. big all day we'll be. on the area [laughter]. wait wait wait wait i have another question. do you get diarrhea. from other people with diarrhea. or you just die. oh i don't know actually. that's a good question. or you just have a bad. stuff pickled movie on the air. yeah yeah that's right. yeah still living still well. not live it anymore. yeah yeah yeah anyway dude. i guess we're going to. stop singing though because it's hurting. i mean a lot of people would really like that. especially the scientists that watch. this they'd be like oh i see it's like a musical. [ __ ] educational music so what we're going to. do is we're going to. stop singing that's fine i'm out. of breath anyway okay cool but how about um so anyway it's not the i don't have al. it's my it's definitely um what. do you call it uh diarrhea. allergies oh i see yeah and i was trying to. do the thing where i where i was sleeping. this morning and moving the [ __ ] down and then i would sleep. it and i'm moving the [ __ ] you know how it changed the snot in your nose. will change and should you go. to one oh yeah. then i move over. to the other side so i can breathe. out of the other should we talk about the thing that you and i both have and we both just realized we both. have it and no one else in the [ __ ] world has it the thing with our nostril. this thing yeah dude. i think you know who else. has it theo vaughn he does. yeah he dude he'll be doing the podcast. and he's like he's doing this. dude what is this it's an epidemic. i'm like what are you. doing dude are you doing this. he's like man i can't really breathe. out i'm like dude. me and my brother but i'll tell you what well didn't you have the sinus. surgery i did i'm gonna have. that did you know. that no no but i dude. i i only had it after the sinus. surgery so i don't know. wow well i'm gonna have uh the sign of surgery. because my [ __ ] is really curvy. dude when i went into. the [ __ ] doctor before i had my sinus surgery. my doctor said was like he sat. down he got a couple brochures. he went out of the room. came back in with the brochures got all. solomon [ __ ] and asked me. about my cocaine problem. seriously and i was like i i i know you think i'm gonna be lying when i say this but that's the one drug i've just never done oh my god yeah and he was like i don't know like he didn't oh really i mean like he was like [ __ ] shore he got brochures before he even [ __ ] asked me what was a brochure like it was like how to. stop using cocaine wow dude. yeah i was like i i my nose. is busted i guess but i've never done. cocaine i swear he was like real. sure dude is that because of the time. where you ran around the corner. and bumped your nose. into the [ __ ] kid's head probably i mean i don't know because i had the surgery. after that because my nose was. like this that's what mine. was like no but oh you had this. right after that right. i ran into. the girl's forehead right. wow and my nose was like this. i was such a [ __ ] heart ass. at the time though i didn't even. say [ __ ] i know i came home and mom was like what happened your [ __ ] face yeah i was like what i looked in the mirror my nose is like this wow look all crooked like this and you have surgery then yeah because it was like if i kept growing. my nose would have been like this. by the time i loved it. dude got it i definitely would have been the hot. brother i would have been the owen. wilson brother yeah right. um strangely he's kind of the hot. brother out of the tool is he though. i think so i think girls think he's sexy. sexier than luke luke's kind of just kind of normal. and he's kind of just got that. [ __ ] but normal is better than [ __ ] yeah when it comes to. like people no one likes blonde. guys no no i know that. blonde guys are [ __ ] all extremely ugly but no one's ever liked a blonde guy no i know i've never seen a blonde guy that's goodlooking no one. in history a no gay man. or heterosexual woman has ever been attracted. to a blonde not over. a brunette dude no no way. no [ __ ] way dude but also just never no i know. never okay never and also if it's up. to liking a blonde. dude or a brunette. dude a girl would literally [ __ ] shoot the blonde. dude in the head with an arrow. oh just just to. breathe in the same. room yes as a guy who has darker. hair even though even. if he's [ __ ] three foot six because blondes are [ __ ] so ugly yeah and they're all ugly and um and uh not blind. women there's just no blondes men. no [ __ ] and if you're a blonde man. and you wear a [ __ ] leather jacket like you're hiding. your ugliness and all of a sudden you're cool. lop your head off so. so [ __ ] lop your head. off like this shing and then have it. just go you don't control. what sorry you do. with your head after you cut it. off no i know what i'm saying. you you lop it off. like this and then you wait. and then it just kind of teases. you oh you wait all right. after you lop your [ __ ] head. off yeah you wait. forever but what i'm saying. is you know the [ __ ] you know the movies. when a [ __ ] samurai guy goes and you're like ooh did he get him. did he get him. and the guy yeah and his [ __ ] face i do know and you're like oh he got him. i do know that movies are dumb. dude movies are dumb. people think [ __ ] just because it happens in movies yeah it's true. it's really really stupid top gun. we got a [ __ ] we got to. see top gun dude. everyone's saying how good it. is i know it all guess. what it's not i know. all it is is a bunch of guys. smirking i didn't see it. but guess what it's not. how many times in topcon do. they go like this [music]. probably everybody 300 more than 300 in the class. in the class where they're [ __ ] like yeah guy with the toothpick dude you guys got a [ __ ] toothpick did you know that's so dumb that. guy's like you're just smirking and the guy's flying. just just smirking it you can't. see the [ __ ] you're flying. yeah that's true but did you know. you have you seen the first. top gun the parts. parts it's that's a movie that don't make don't remake. a movie [ __ ] 30 years later not remake. but couldn't agree more yeah it's like but that wasn't you. remember how that wasn't my question. what's the question have you. ever seen them not all. the way through i answered that. okay okay okay okay but the point is you know. how anthony you'll get some questions. anthony edwards is in the first one. and he dies and he's goose ruined. it but yes he miles teller. plays his son in this one. that's not good dude but also that's not. good for anybody but also wouldn't he be older. miles tell her son would be like 50. no no i mean how long ago. he was on 40. when he was in top. gun wasn't he but he was probably like an infant. and then so no i mean it. makes sense there's some timeline. issues here they're not going for [ __ ] reality maverick patrick. stewart should be should play oh yes up in the air. like this yeah smirking oh clouds. yes um so anyway dude. top gun's probably bad stop saying. it's good stop saying it's good. stop don't don't remake a movie. don't sorry i see keep saying. remake but the truth it's like the matrix dude. don't make the trilogy. come 30 years later. make new [ __ ] no but they won't do that but do it i i guess man. i don't know i mean. all people do is recycle [ __ ] that happened. before the year 2000 that's all that. ever happens because they didn't think that's gonna what's gonna. start really making movies that. weren't even hit so i can't. wait for that the absolute [ __ ] lulu they are yeah nothing new will ex. will be made in 12. years from now okay you said you heard it. here yeah you heard it. here first all right well let's get to. some questions how this is lifeline. it's in a vice show. right it is and we've just kind of been [ __ ] i know. you guys like it sometimes. when we [ __ ] so we [ __ ] a little bit also remember we had that debacle when [ __ ] chris our producer didn't have enough videos oh yeah yeah that was horrible so um anyway we're good now dude and maybe we have some videos maybe we have enough maybe we don't but here we go baby. hi chris and matt my name's hannah. i need advice about a coworker. relationship my work with this woman. monday to friday nine. hours a day and she tells horrible. stories there's no point to. them no arc there's no beginning middle or end she just starts. off on a story that. has no point and i don't even. know what part i'm supposed to. be reacting to. wow because nothing happens in them. so i just do a lot. of wow that's crazy. and uh you know like fake laughing. and it's getting really exhausting. and i don't know maybe i should spin move. out of this one probably not gonna work so any advice. you can give me would be great. i don't know if i should say. hey these stories suck i don't. know what you want from me. or if i just keep fake. laughing let me know i love you. guys so much you have no. idea oh thanks i love. you too it is a predicament. i i i here's what i would do. okay at this i don't know if i would advise. this but this is what i would do. i would start and then increasingly do this. i would start to. do this and then increasingly do it. louder and louder until she inquired about what the [ __ ] i was doing right i would just start saying oh all right and then longer and longer oh and like over her story so she knows you yeah she knows you're not even hearing. her anymore you know and then she would be like what are you. doing what are you doing right. exactly and then you just be like that's all i it's all. i don't know yeah what are you. doing yeah yeah yeah um and then take it from there. but take it from that. type of conversation about it. i think um well first of all part. of me wants to. be like this is part. of your job like whatever job you have that's the part. of it for also you have too many. drinks out here right. i'm ready dude we have too. many drinks i'm always thirsty. at the end so i came [ __ ] ready. okay you hate [ __ ] like this. right yeah dude why like dude. no first of all there's two you have two of these you. should only have one of them. look at what i do. i keep my [ __ ] clear because i want people to. be seeing [ __ ] who cares shut the [ __ ] up. the shot's all boring why. don't you like this. the shot's dirty you're not in a [ __ ] you know what i mean. a [ __ ] what's his name movie what movie the [ __ ] guy who did the uh look though my coffee's traffic who did traffic steven soderbergh my coffee's. hot my coffee's hot. it's an awfully hot. coffee drinking like a dildo. all right yeah my [ __ ] coffee's eye. dude dude what the [ __ ] dude um i should do cat drink. my coffee man. okay um so anyway advisor. okay so um [ __ ] now i'm hot. and [ __ ] oh good dude. um i could not be man. you're sucking it in a dildo. you know um [ __ ] so i think that it's part of your job. you don't know what your job. is but that sucks but also just be like um i mean. i don't know i i what i would. do is i would say like i mean. i do it to. my i have a friend that he's kind of guilty of this. he'll he'll be like did i tell you about this. chick and i'll be like no and he'll be like about the chick. that i met the at the thing. and i'm like no and and then he'll be like okay. so and then it take he'll like do this. preamble of like you didn't even. start the goddamn nobody nobody needs. a preamble you didn't even. you didn't even like and i and i you didn't even. like say you didn't even say. anything yet you know it's like it's like so so there's multiple ways. of telling bad stories it sounds. like she's just wants to. talk to hear herself. talk it sounds like she's actually impressively bad. at it well yeah i do too that's the other thing. too here's what i would. advise advise her is have fun. with it dude i would love to. hear a story like that yeah. you would because it blows. my mind that people like i have friends. that do that and kristen will be like how do you hang out. with that person yeah you and i say because it's so fun. you have the always had you have always had the weirdest friends. i know dude i really have now. right now you have the least weird. in your i know. i need to get back. to weird friends but i do have some but but i just have fun. with it dude this is a gift. she's giving you a gift. this lady is giving you a gift. she's being boring as [ __ ] which means you are allowed. to just take that brain. time off right she's saying what she's saying. think about whatever you want. and have fun with it. do the o thing like that. yeah yeah just i mean are you worried. about hurting her feelings or what. i don't know why you would be though. because she's clearly oblivious to. a lot if she's telling stories like this. do an intervention with her. but at a certain point. just like do whatever. the [ __ ] you want don't fake laugh don't don't be courteous. yeah you don't have to. be rude but just be weird. see what happens like this. woman clearly is something's a little bit wrong. in her head like who the [ __ ] tells stories like that that's a very strange. thing to do you don't. begin you have no end it's just. like you just are saying words. you know he could do this. is a really great. way to have fun with it. she tells her story it's very boring. yeah keep keep bringing it. up afterwards yeah yeah like every day. multiple times a day yeah like i can't stop thinking about actually. like that was the way. you told me like it's really. crazy you were at the park. right and you saw that. guy doing karate like yeah you know what do you think he's doing yeah. yeah and just keep bringing it. up and having her be like having her be the this. is great having her be the one. who was like why do you keep asking. about this i was like well because it was obviously. really important to. you yeah and like you know. and then she'll stop telling you stories for sure. but then even keep bringing it. up yeah never call her. late call her one text her. email her on your work. god that's crazy about the karate guy. or whatever the [ __ ] story you know on your work email keep a conversation. this is great i wish subject. matter subject remember the karate. guy yeah yeah yeah karate. guy update and then in the body anything karate. guy memorial um all right cool. that's great advice that was good. advice yeah all right cool. next one what's up. chris and matt uh my name is norma jean. i'm from southern oregon. it's my dog um i have some breakup. advice question for you guys. i am 30 and going. through my first breakup in a very long time. i spent most of my 20s. single and haven't been through. a breakup in a long time. and i need my community. a lot and i think i'm making the right. choice and man i keep trying. to do this video without crying. but pity um breakups are sad. and um i don't want to. wear my friends out with it but i do need them and you know i guess my question is when do i know that my friends. are [ __ ] sick of it. is there like a timeline. like you get 30. days um just maybe some general. rules about breakups and how you guys approach. them and how you support friends. and breakups and um maybe some words. uh thanks for the podcast. and i look forward. to hearing from you guys. thanks that's my favorite person. that has called into. the show so far yeah you like the realness. of it yeah um so i think that they're not your friend. if they get sick of your thing. about being broken up it. doesn't there is no. [ __ ] time limit there is no nothing if you're if your friends are like oh my god she's going on again about the breakup i i actually think they're not really that good yeah yeah yeah i've had friends that have gone on and on and on about it for [ __ ] months and months and months right and i'll tell you this though i mean this ought to. make you feel good it's just true. though i'm not trying to. make you feel good it. always ends up. the same way the person. [ __ ] moves on and forgets and ends up was with someone else and that is a better. relationship that's happened to. every single [ __ ] time me me or any of my friends who have come to. me about breakup advice yeah or wanted just to. [ __ ] wallow about the breakup. it's always the case. that they end up not only forgetting. about it but in a relationship. that they are better off. in so my advice to. you is don't worry about wearing your friends. out that's it yeah well if this is your time. right yeah exactly like like i guess. that's what i would say. like you're this is what your friends. are here for if you're if you're not building. up like goodwill with your friends. and [ __ ] being friends to. them then this is your time. where you get to. only worry about yourself worry about yourself. but also like just worry about yourself. take some [ __ ] me time i hate when people say that. but you know i have a feeling. probably you know you couldn't get through. this video without crying. because of the realness but also because you i noticed you have a dream. catcher a lot of women. who dream catchers cry. more normal than women. who don't have dreams now. here's my question yeah what is a dream. catcher it's the thing in the back. that was a circle that people hang on their car. if you have some people have a lot. of people have two they'll have one. in their room and then one in their car. and they're on their windshield. those people cry a lot. okay are you talking [ __ ] about her i mean i'm lightly just having fun okay but also careful. though because if you talk [ __ ] no i love it with overalls is and also she's very she's obviously very sweet and also crying isn't bad crying is great. no crying's great but like here's the deal. though where's the cut off and i'm going. to play devil's advocate because. i understand you're like it doesn't matter. how long but where's the cutoff six months. okay a year bro if my buddy. was like man this chick. a year and a half. later it sounds like it's recent okay and i'm on her. side and i think that you should talk. about it with your friends. as much as you want and i'm sure they want to. be there for you too. because if they're not going to. be there for the shitty. friends right but also where's the cutoff well she's not going to. be wallowing for a year. look look at her she's [ __ ] great. she's going to have [ __ ] pick of the litter in no. time i know but i'm just saying there's got to. be some sort of cut off. give yourself a [ __ ] cut off too you can do that i mean if you're just talking about wendy's. also just i think broadly the broader advice. here is that don't she said. a month she was like a month. she said it is a month. too long oh no. no for example way longer yeah. yeah but my advice to. you is don't worry about when the end. is going to come. because when you're worrying about when the end is going. to come that's when the end. never prolongs the end you. just spoke over me very very very. poignant and that's a lot. like john lennon and john lennon once. said stop bringing up john lennon quotes. you don't even know all right. you always do this he said something. about like you always bring up. [ __ ] john lennon you don't even know what it was dude. something about time. i can't [ __ ] remember oh okay you don't even remember any more. words than just you know. much about john lennon i'm just saying no. [ __ ] somebody out there said something really [ __ ] poignant about something that what you're saying and they said it probably better. than you did no i said it. [ __ ] great yeah and you spoke over it. okay don't worry about when the end. is gonna come when you're worrying about when the end. is gonna come the end. never comes just [ __ ] hang out. with your dog hang out with your friends. talk about it as much. as you want think about whatever. the [ __ ] you want to. think about but don't think about when the end's going. to come because that is when the end. will never [ __ ] come get it it doesn't matt i'm not saying. stop thinking about it you think about what. you think about but don't try. to hurry it the [ __ ] up it's going to. come when it's going. to come but it's never going. to come when you're worrying about when it's going. to come all right. so but then you're saying think about you're going. to think about what we're going. to think about it's okay. for her to think about what. she's thinking about right but it's not okay. for me to be thinking. about when i'm talking about john. lennon and that's shitty. right why are you making it. about you i'm not i'm saying. it's okay to. think about what you're going. to think about as a person. but also when i mentioned the john lennon thing. you're like don't mention john. lemon but that's what i'm thinking. i only say that about john. lennon because you don't. know what the thing john lennon said. is and you say that's like a thing. john lennon said and then you don't. even know what it was you're gonna. be fine bottom line is you you. can tell you're a very sweet. woman and you're a ve. you got that dog that's very sweet. and you obviously care. and you have some sort of like um quality about you that's very like um [music]. i mean that dream catcher. like it's very nice to. be like believing in things and like hoping for the best. like it's a very spiritual kind of a i think you're going. to be well you are going. to be fine yeah she's the best. she's the best person that um okay. ask for our advice all right. well she's the very very best. okay sorry to everyone. else she's the very number one. best i mean we don't know. but yeah she knows she was definitely good. yeah i know she was a lot. better than the [ __ ] guy with the towel on his head i'll tell you that much no remember the [ __ ] guy um no a lot better. than the guy who had the [ __ ] towel on his head or the guy who had the big eyes. and the big mouth yeah we've had some bad. um but she's great and and we and it's great. yeah and now i gotta do dates. because i forgot to. do it oh i know atlanta washington dc stockton oakland. peoria illinois i'm coming chrisleya dot com. raleigh

never as important. as your [ __ ] mental health right. so man [ __ ] uh social media [ __ ] up your mental health like i can't even go on a lot of the social media i go on you know i post an instagram i'll post a tick tock and i don't really look at i definitely the only thing i really kind of look at is instagram but um but this is what you do if you take a break. you happen to be taking a break. you don't say hey guys i'm taking a break. that's the most annoying [ __ ] [ __ ] sucking ass oh yeah social media as egotistical [ __ ] guys just to. let you know i'll be taking a break from. [ __ ] social media. and you're just like you don't call. your friends to tell them. they're to tell them you're staying home. if they didn't invite you out. like who gives a [ __ ] hello. hey rick

of the whole like imagine him. and then yeah i think he wrote it. out in final giraffe too no he's a right. yeah so bad one. wants to flex that he's got deals. i'm sorry to say. it yeah wow dude. i don't think he has deals. um but i think that i agree. with what my brother. just said but i also just from personal. experience i've gone through phases where i've been like without even realizing. it just checking instagram incessantly. that's right that's good and i and then i've gone. through phases where i'm at first. i'll force myself to. stop checking incessantly and then i just will stop yeah. and now i'm in a place. where like i don't really i think it's more. about how often you check it. right it's not about how much you post. it's about how much you check right. yeah yeah well yeah that's i mean. posting is fine is is. what it is that takes no time. sure but also the checking of it is almost up in my mouth. the checking of it is what makes you is the is. the what makes you feel bad. about yourself yeah so stop checking right i know what i'm saying yeah. but um stop checking jason and also the first day. you do it is easier. the second day. you do it like dude. when i get a [ __ ] burger from in and out the next thing. i want to. do is get a burger. from in and out but if i don't eat a burger. from in and out then i don't want. a burger for right. now right yeah

50. 60 hours old and you know people ask. us like when's the oh when are you gonna get married. and you know we don't get the bags. baby you know yeah. so you're young yeah i my question is do you think it's okay to. be engaged for a long time. and you know how to. respond when people ask. like when's the [ __ ] wedding you know because none of the bags. and you know i want to. get married he doesn't care. as much about as much as me. about like having a big one. he's got a [ __ ] you don't say you know [ __ ] his balls are underneath i want to. but actually you know it's just not in the cards. because you've got balls on the other side. of his anus you know that's my question. so thanks guys love. the pod thanks uh [ __ ] all those people that ask when's the date. dude when somebody says they're engaged i don't even. think oh when's the wedding. what the [ __ ] are these people no well i mean this is a perfect [ __ ] spin move mentality dude. hey when's the date when i wanna and twitter yeah. well yeah moonwalk but i've never agreed. with that but i agree with it. this time yeah but also that how much is that [ __ ] girl for real the girl that they would cast in a movie where that's how she's supposed to. be [ __ ] looking ugly and then she gets done. up and people are like wow when she's even hot. like that yeah i mean. she's already so funny that's what you're saying. she's not yeah that's what i'm saying. but like she would be like like that's how they would dress. her yeah and that [ __ ] like rachel. cook i was just gonna she's like she's so hot with his glasses on like that's how that's what it would be um so uh yeah dude um it's okay to. be engaged for a long time. [ __ ] be engaged for 10 [ __ ] years yeah dude only be engaged die. in game die engage. i agree die have. kids have a whole family. never get i have good kids. get married first grow up. get married and be like mom. and dad why you're not engaged be like cause you. [ __ ] people like you [ __ ] keep on asking spin away have your kid pass. on the spin move mentality that's. what's up made it about the spin movement. mentality but yeah die. engaged that's a good that's a guy. engaged and you get tattoos that. say that die engaged oh that's cool. so german die yeah yeah yeah um but uh yeah die. engaged dude like that's awesome. as a matter of fact. and and and if somebody asks you unless if you don't want to. do the spin move then do this. move but if somebody asks. you when the date is just do a long. pause and don't answer them. so i guess it's not a long. pause just wait until they say another thing. but stare at them. honestly stereotype tears come out. of your eyes until they say another thing. or at the or say. oh that's an interesting question. when's the what's the last date. you jacked off oh yeah that's good. yeah yeah and then and then they say what. and they say well since we're asking personal. questions yes spin and [ __ ] you're out so you add a spin to. that that's the one. coolest thing about spin moves. is you can do it. before you say the thing. or after you say the thing. oh is that one. of the coolest things. about it okay. yeah dude good don't sweat. the question dude [ __ ] those [ __ ] well those people i mean that's just a natural question to. ask i would i don't ask it. come on don't be you i don't ask. you i don't i don't [ __ ] even think it. should be like yo dude. come on with that. question just be like that yeah. that's good come on what. the [ __ ] are you gonna be one of those guys yeah before they even finish the questions. or or go like this go. like this yeah we're engaged and then before they say anything. go like what when's the date. that's good that's great that's the best. one yeah yeah right yeah. that's the best one. actually yeah scratch everything that we said before. all right next one dude. dj khaled what's up. guys my name is fellman. i'm loving the show i just thought i'd reach out. for some advice um so i've noticed lately. that whenever i have sex. with my fiance you know. i look at myself in the mirror. if there is one nearby oh my face was just [ __ ] up you know i just look like adam. sandler and little nikki just all. like oh my god wow so this. one right now does this. face matter during sex um should i try. to focus and work on maybe making a more sexy. face as i'm doing it. you know or what it's going. to just let my face muscles. do what they got to. do thanks that guy's [ __ ] hilarious also he has the creakiest [ __ ] floor in history what a great. question i think about this. often dude i would also suggest. just my advice actually would be a little bit. of a misdirect stop looking in the f. [ __ ] mirror when you're having sex with you patrick bateman maybe he's trying to. not splurt early and he's just like. you're so hot and he just looks at himself. and he's like whoa i'm ugly. by making those faces [ __ ] it and then the splirt level. goes down okay okay um oh i there's two things you can do go. fully fully into it yeah. i don't i don't think you should change. yourself yeah you got to. go to the net. what i like to call. the next level right. okay you got to. go to another planet you got to. go to mars and say it. too when you're about to. splurt sweetie i'm going. to mars and then just go home. right okay so you could do like that. uh oh sweetie we're going. and [ __ ] you know it. would be cool if you if you blast. off in ten nine stupid you gotta get it. good though you got to. get right bro you know you know get it. right eight seven prepare prepare. for blast off six five oh oh i'm going. early to bars you know. or or what you can. do is if you don't like that. approach going full into. it if there's too many. mirrors around and you get insecure. seeing your [ __ ] ugly face. while you're humping what you. can do is and this really. works bro it really [ __ ] works dude. before you have sex throw in a stick. of gum and just concentrate on this. i mean that is really patrick. bateman what the [ __ ] i'm saying i'm saying though dude get a job on wall street too well because then you're just like but what what what but what is it. what does it help because you're not. you're subconsciously not necessarily thinking you're subconsciously. chewing the gum and you can't really scrunch up your face. when you're just kind of chewing. your gum and you're it's it's a very relaxed. vibe right yeah but like this. and then you're like go tomorrow. sweetie chewing gum while you're having sex is not for good. people it's the [ __ ] it's not forget the [ __ ] i don't agree also that's crazy let the face fly. dude just [ __ ] let it rip let the face fly. for sure but i'm saying if he's insecure. about it put a stick. of extra in your mouth. or have a maybe a maybe just a pouch of gushers. and just be eating them. just don't look in that. [ __ ] mirror if you're getting a bj eating a [ __ ] stack of gushers don't eat gushers and then they go here comes the gusher. here comes the gusher in itself. if you're if you're over 10 years. old don't eat gushers. when i was gushers was terrible. 10 or 11 i ate. so many electric blue gushers. that my [ __ ] was electric blue senator senator please get back to. health care it's true. though it happened senator and i was [laughter]. i was really superimposed over. your face i was really worried. about it and uh then i remembered i ate. so many guys senator those are my poll. numbers the republican [ __ ] going yeah those are my poll. numbers i'll ask you a question. okay yeah yeah okay okay all right. yeah don't look in the mirror. just stop i don't know let the face. fly don't look in the mirror. you're good let the face fly. you know let the face fly hey guys my name. is molly i'm a mom. of two boys. one who's almost 12 one. who is four so we've got quite. an age gap there yeah you guys. are brothers so i'm hoping you can help. me out with this i have been a single mom since october 2021. because my husband is deployed. he gets back in about four. months wow i absolutely am. going insane yeah because they cannot stop picking on each other. and it's constant whining by my little one. and constant frustration by my. older ones so first and foremost. is this normal oh yeah should i expect this for the rest. of their i don't know. teenage lives until they get out of the house. i don't know what to. expect they're complete opposite kids. um and if this is the norm what the [ __ ] am i gonna do yeah what do i do how do i do i stop it do i let it happen. do i ignore it do. i address it do i you know. tell the big one to. buck up and take care like i have i just i'm to. the point where yeah it is so gross. okay i i just like my little kid. will come running out. and i hear him. whining and you'll say mommy and i just look and turn and i just say. no and then he whines even more so i don't know what the best. thing is to. do so i would love your advice. on this and i'm sure you guys have some great. stories please tell me what your mom. and your dad did but mom specifically maybe i don't know. you guys thank you so much. love the show thank you i can't. wait to hear what you tell. me oh dude remember the time. when [ __ ] we were at the cozy. end and oh and you this. is a place in new jersey. that had taylor ham. and eggs right mmhmm and uh is that what you call. it tell her him an egg taylor ham. can be with anything but tell her anything but that was what the question. has yeah which is what i'm asking. obviously you're asking what something's called. right but is it. tyler having an excuse on. my podcast i said taylor eggs. and ham i think is what. i said that's wrong. that's wrong it's taylor hemings so. that's the thing that's tailored. it's taylor not tailored i. understand that but if if you're talking about the past. tense that the ham. was tailored no because it's taylor and then you're not getting. like a suit snipped what did. you eat taylor taylor ham. correct right that's it. and how was it good. it was tailored okay the suspense is. killing me what happened. what happened at the cosine. okay so we were at the coast. again we're at the cozy. end and mom was sitting. between us and we were at the [ __ ] counter and we were eating. at the counter and you said something. that was shitty and mom turns. to me immediately and [ __ ] goes pop. in my face and i was like what the [ __ ] and she was like you she was like oh sorry i meant for matt. oh my god yeah you don't remember this. not at all and i was like well you can hit him. now she hit you nah. i mean you know okay. yeah i mean she you know. she goes like not just a little [ __ ] like this like watch your mouth. you know okay yeah well [ __ ] anyway i don't remember that. at all and i actually don't even think it. happened no i said look. you got to hit mad. now she laughs i mean. she laughed dude and she was like no. i'm not going to. hit him now i didn't i shouldn't even have done it. to you and i was like that's not fair. that's a good moment. it was so fun dude. so i owe you so i should slap. you so one i have a story myself. of my own uh one summer. you were like 14. and i was 11. it was in our peak picking on each other. years our mom offered us. 70 all right 75. 25 to not fight for the whole summer. 75 right it was 25. or something like that to. not fight for the entire summer. it was like it was like end of may. or so i think it was ten. dollars okay any [ __ ] way i just you know inflation. you gotta count okay. sure factor it in uh 1.5 so the day. that we agreed to. that we were like so stoked like that's gonna be so [ __ ] easy i remember we got into. her suburban yeah and within [ __ ] two minutes. of the car ride yeah. we're like punching each other yeah. and she was like all right. the deal's off you get no money. yeah but it was like within a [ __ ] hour. we were like gonna do it. for three months all right. we were so stoked about it. so confident and within within an hour. we lost our money. and i will tell you this. much and i i know this with my heart. it was your fault. i'm sure it was you were you were the person. that cause i was like this. could be easy i can do. it for sure and then you didn't do it. and then shoot and then i was like but i still get the money. and she was like no. no well that's both of you. yeah so you owe me. 10 and i get to. slap you on the heels of that. i would say the answer. is absolutely you have to. expect it with boys. 12 and four it's gonna get 10. 11. it doesn't matter the the thing. that might save her is that. eight is a pretty big gap mmhmm. and eight years like when he's 18. and the other one's 10 yeah. there might not be a lot. of picking on it the 18. year old might just be at that. point mature enough to. not do it anymore. but right until he's maybe at least 16. i would say definitely expect it also. um it's going to. get like t i always like my friends. who are older and have older kids. like i mean calvin's. too but like they say that. the teenage years are the absolute worst. for sure they're the worst yeah. for sure but i would say that. because your kid will be like [ __ ] no and you're like yeah. yeah yeah yeah uh talk to. the 12 year old the fouryearold. is four what what the [ __ ] you're talking about. you're gonna do it yeah you talk. to the problem and be like look you're the man. of the house yeah dude. you're the man of the house. be a [ __ ] man don't be a little shitty little brat picking on a fouryearold. [ __ ] four years old you're gonna pick on him the kid you gotta talk to. the twelve yeah but don't say. it like that be like dude. i'm really disappointed yeah right. i want you to. be the man of the house. but it turns out you're just not and then turn your head. and kind of turn your body. let your body follow and then just walk away. and then see what he's also saying. your father would also be very disappointed. yep yeah and god forbid and you know. maybe you're together with the father. but he's at work or maybe you're not together. with the father even worse. or maybe the father even passed away. which even what do you. forget he's [ __ ] deployed. she said that yeah i didn't hear. that come on back. in four months use those four months. as like a but even better dude. like if this keeps up i'm gonna have to. tell him when he gets back. if you if you stop and you know he's gonna i won't even tell him. yep he's gonna drive. his [ __ ] fleet back or whoever you know maybe he's with i don't know if he's with the navy or the air. force or whatever. the [ __ ] doesn't even matter at all yeah like when he gets back you know your dad's gonna come back. and you know he's gonna be really pissed. off and he's probably gonna have some ptsd. and he's gonna [ __ ] flip out so okay well that's not good maybe he saw his friend die. or something like that and you're gonna [ __ ] it all up just by complaining about how you have to. wear it [ __ ] them up you're gonna [ __ ] up the kid if you say that oh [ __ ] because we have macaroni and cheese again and your dad's out there watching his best friends die. right i say that. leave that part out and just say the part. about your father would be very disappointed. in you and if you stop now maybe i won't tell him. when he gets home but if you keep it up. i'm going to tell him. and it's going to. be very bad for you. oh you're bet oh you're oh i'm sorry. you gotta go to. bed at 8 30. tonight when your dad. is out there burying his friends. six feet deep trudging through. the mud holding a half. a body okay well let's find out. when we get off when he gets home. let's see what matters yeah you. could try that i guess. i mean you've been so aggressive about it. i kind of relented but i don't think you should try. that but i guess you can because you won't. stop doing we're out there your father's out. there fighting a war. that doesn't need to. be fought right wow and you're pissed. you have soccer practice that's not what's happening. they're picking on each other did. you listen yeah no you didn't

gotta be hard [ __ ] dude yeah solid four's hard. and on our own. i mean my i i know yeah. god bless for real. my son looked at me. today and he's the other day. and he said i don't like dada. yeah like okay well here we go. you should have been more likeable i'm [ __ ] super likable. to him i'm the most likable. i don't well that's obviously. not true he said otherwise. no but he doesn't know. what he's saying i made him. paper airplanes all night last night. and he [ __ ] took them and just basically crushed them. like i mean like it took long i was looking tutorials making i made an f16. dude i mean an f16. it looked just like an f16. speaking about being brothers i remember i could never make a paper airplane you always could do it really well you had a book that had all the different instructions all about the different ones you could do oh you got one stuck on you that's why i got that for you oh thanks yeah for us for our childhood no get the [ __ ] out of here that's not why you did it i swear to. god that's why why you never even. told me that it's for me. i don't want to. be like [ __ ] you just want to. tell me on the podcast. only yeah it's a symbol of how like of brothers. oh for real i didn't know. that yeah why didn't you ever. say that until now i did say that. but you were probably doing your own. thing i was probably yeah. not listening anyway i'm cute. i do cute stuff but yeah molly. talk to the [ __ ] 12. year old and expect it to. never stop even after you talk. to him but try talk. to a 12yearold the fouryearold's. four the [ __ ] is he gonna change he's just gonna be four until he's not four you know he's gonna be five he's gonna be five until he's not five maybe when he's out. you're good counting ten. maybe you could talk to. him then that's five years. later yeah so just forget about that. i'm saying right the other kid. will be 17 by then. talk to the [ __ ] older one. tell him to be the man. of the house yeah man. i mean it's like john lennon said. dude wow i'm not even going. to get into it. but that well that's because you don't know. what he said uh cool. is that it that's all we have no. we have one more no another. one oh cool hey matt and chris. uh my name is helga. i was just about to. pull up the episode of lifeline. but instead decided to. share my wealth of toxicness with you. guys cool um so i was wondering if you guys. had any um advice for me. it's about a sexual partner. um him and i have been just randomly. having sex for about two years. but um he hasn't really wanted me. to tell anyone and the fact is because he dated my he did. date my best friend oh [ __ ] um and so i don't know i've always thought it was kind of lame like obviously i don't want to. go tell everybody okay. i'm [ __ ] this guy but like i always thought it was kind of lame that i don't know. he would even be like let's not. tell anybody yeah so i you know whatever. we continued and now it's been two years. and now like sometimes i think it's personal. i don't know if that's just my mental. health where i'm like oh does. he not want people to. know because it's me or of me. you know so um i just don't know. what to do when i'm asking for. your advice if i should either. i don't know i feel like there's a couple options. i could either just drop him. completely which is kind of not fun. because the reason why i do just hook up. with him is is because he's just like a easy. and fun lay like to. be honest and he hopefully says the same. about me but like i'm just being brutally. honest he's fun and he's easy uh the second thing. is like bring it up. to him like tell him. like hey i don't like that. we can't really tell people. like it makes me feel gross. and then see how he reacts. but i don't want that. to turn the tap. off yeah and then or i could just keep going. on with my life and just feel the way. i feel i don't know or just tell me. that this isn't even that. big of a deal and that i'm being dramatic. because well that wouldn't matter that. could be real too well. thanks for listening guys. i so appreciate it. uh life rips and i'm so happy. that you guys have the show. together can't wait to. hear it and i hope to. hear your dad on here. soon she's cool too um she's cool. yeah i think that definitely don't sit. on it like if it's been two years. and he's still like oh he can't. do it don't talk over. me but you know what i mean. no you don't know what i mean. no that's what this whole. podcast is but don't talk over. me worst dad i think that you don't. sit on it you don't just not say. [ __ ] you i think what you should do is ask him why because maybe that will clarify something and if his answer he's not gonna say because it's you if that's the reason but maybe there's an answer we're not thinking of maybe has a good reason good right yeah and if it's a good reason that would change her feelings it would remove her insecurity because it's a good reason right and if he's [ __ ] fumbles over his words or has a [ __ ] reason or like is clearly think of a lie then you'd be like oh well like i this i don't really like this anymore. like it doesn't it's been going. on two [ __ ] years we can't talk about that's so stupid what are we [ __ ] 17 like we gotta [ __ ] be adults. about this like two years. is a long time. you know so i think ask him. why he doesn't want to. tell anybody don't say i want. to start telling people don't get any other way. about it just plainly. ask him why he wants to. continue to. not tell people i mean his original. reason was he doesn't want people to. know because it was his friend. right that's what we would. assume that's not necessarily what she thinks got it. yeah but she said recently. she's just been starting to. think about that it might be that. i don't know i don't know kind of she did. i think that was implied yeah. um that lately she started. thinking about that maybe it's her. uh you know what it. sounds like dude what sounds like she might be [ __ ] kidding herself. and she might be getting some feelings. for the guy oh and i think that you gotta look. into that you gotta check yourself. about that and that's okay. if it happened sure yeah because the truth. is man i'm not one. of those like if you want to. date somebody that your friend dated. like who gives a [ __ ] yeah i do it i don't care about doing. [ __ ] it's so lame when people are like possessive about people that they used to. be with i get it. on one hand and like i you know. if my friend started dating somebody that. i dated i might immediately. be like oh that feels weird. but then i'd be like well actually it's not it's not this. life is a long time. yeah this is [ __ ] fine um but you might be feeling. a little bit of it. to me it sounds like you. want you you're starting. to maybe have a little bit. of feelings for the guy. and that's kind of all i have to. say i feel like maybe you want. people to know because you're you. want to experience the other side. of not just sex i mean. yeah you said you don't want to. cut off the tap which is a disgusting. way to put it. but also you um i disagree by. the way it's gross. at all look i know like it's great. when you bust off. like a sprinkler but like you know. i think that maybe you're feeling. for him a little bit and that's okay. but he may not be reciprocated if he doesn't want people to. know right not because it's you but because he feels shady. about his friend or whatever. the [ __ ] it is but i would just tell him and be like bro. who cares we've been [ __ ] doinking. for a bit now and like it was a while. ago i dated your friend. and like who gives you [ __ ] no no no no he dated her best. friend oh yeah you didn't listen. again which is well then even even. more then it doesn't matter. because it's her the one that being the [ __ ] yes the quoteunquote bad. person it's not bad. but like well yeah but i would understand. why they wouldn't yeah i would get into. especially the same aspect but like um yeah yeah i mean. you're assuming a lot there. though to be honest. yeah maybe that's not true. what maybe she's not getting feelings. for him yeah but that's what it. sounds like right when she says that that's how i feel okay. but i if she's not i didn't. that didn't cross my mind. that could be the case. but assuming she she's not. actually getting feelings for him she's just sick. and tired of not being able to. tell anybody because otherwise why. would you care at all. i know i get it it's weird. after two years it is weird. why we're not allowed. to say anything anybody has it. been two years that's what she said. you don't listen to. anybody but that's interesting. she definitely likes him then because why. the [ __ ] would you give a [ __ ] if you didn't care truly you would be like yeah i don't want anybody she's explained she said she's starting to. think maybe it's because it's her and that's making her. insecure no no i know but i'm saying if she that's why you know. she's getting feelings no dude. no i'm just saying dude. i'm a detective when it comes. to [ __ ] like this then you're like shitty detective no way dude i'm like yes we got some evidence you're a shitty detective no i'm not dude. yes you are i guarantee. she's got feelings for him. there i said it i [ __ ] said it dude and she's got feelings. for him and i know it. dude and you know what the guy. knows it too and you know. what her friend knows it too. about that no one. knows no one knows that i guarantee. more people know it than nobody shut. the [ __ ] [ __ ] up fine dude i have a followup question and tell me how i'm i guarantee she has feelings for him and i wasn't gonna come out. and be that broad about. it but you know what you back. me into a corner. you back me into. a corner and i know that [ __ ] i'm like this. i'm like this okay. i also got to. bag this that's not what detectives do. ever okay that's what inspector gets i got one. of those hats that go. you know i mean with no. sides just like a duck. bill and a [ __ ] one in the back. not even something you know. those [ __ ] hats dude do i yeah those [ __ ] hats oh yeah you're just thinking yeah yeah i just think ask. him why he he's so insistent. you don't [ __ ] tell anybody it's been two years. get over it dude [ __ ] people are gonna know do you like the way i make you bust off like a sprinkler yes or no just come out. and say that not at all. then i'm tweeting about our. relationship if the answer is no i gladly. bow out and i'm done. just just ask just [ __ ] ask him why he doesn't want. to tell anybody okay. take it from there okay. if it's a shitty answer. be like that's [ __ ] stupid i think i'm gonna either we continue and we can tell people or like i don't really want to. do this anymore yeah. it makes you feel gross. dude and you talked over me. again and um or if it's a good. reason and it opens your eyes. to whatever the [ __ ] i don't know. what that could be but maybe there. is a good reason then your mind. would not be on this. sort of insecure trail that. it is currently on. yeah so you'll do yourself. a favor get the [ __ ] truth. answer true answer from him it's like [ __ ] john lennon said if you're not in a way you may if you're right. away i make your bus off like a sprinkler tell
