entertainment. and when it was an f. standing for federation it wasn't. clear that it was not real. that it was [ __ ] fake so they changed it. to an e to. make sure that we all knew. it was entertainment none of that's true. but um yeah i might have made that that's not true. that's not true at all. yeah okay well i think i thought they changed the company. uh because of how they uh

harry potter. i don't know all of a sudden. you're saying you've seen the first three. let me tell you this. i saw two harry potters. and a half two and a half. harry potters two harry potters. and the half okay. harry putters what the third one wasn't cutting it. or what no i i fell. asleep because i wasn't cutting. it but it was late. oh okay um i don't i don't know. what it's about there said it. and you don't either yes dude and everyone says it's so good. and i don't know what it's about. and here's even more i don't know. how to describe what it's about. yes dude it's impossible you're a [ __ ] idiot dude you've see there's eight of the movies. watch it and you've seen two and a half. of them and you don't know. what it's it's about kids. in a school that no. magic and then they learn. magic and then also there's evil. there i guess and a guy is like trying. to come back to. life and he keeps trying. to come back to. life and the kids like don't like them. but some of the kids do that's exactly. how jk rowling pitched. it dude i don't know what it's about. well then you're stupid fantastic. beasts i watched [ __ ] some of it it's by jk rowling it's by just kidding. railings do you know. what do you know. what that's about yes it's about a guy. who [ __ ] tries to. uh collect all the beasts. because the beasts get out. in the city and the beast. can't be known because the beasts. are in the underworld and he's like this. liaison between the beast. world and the regular world and he can't figure out how to. get him and he has to. get them all back here's what before. everyone feels realizes that the beast. here's what i don't like and i haven't even seen. it any of this [ __ ] based on jk rowling's books just kidding rallings makes books. that are about crazy. [ __ ] dude they just keep on making up. rules i'm watching it. with kristin i'm like that. yeah i'm like so wait. why does why why. is he now over here. and she's like because this is the land. where everything's okay and yeah. he just has to. ask for help and then he gets it. there's always a land. where that thing's open. and i'm like what everything. else is not okay. everywhere else this is a [ __ ] movie this is why a lot of the scifi [ __ ] is [ __ ] because you don't need to. actually write good [ __ ] because you can just like it it's like if a [ __ ] movie was a um a regular movie not with [ __ ] scifi and then all of a sudden in this movie they were like oh well but here's the [ __ ] actual mechanism that if you press. a button everyone forgets everything. and then they can move on. with their lives that's just but they're making it. do you know what i'm saying. or no like you're saying the right. way to say what you're saying. is if you don't set up. the world clearly at the beginning. it sucks scifi is yes a slippery slope. because you can just keep making [ __ ] up. keep making [ __ ] up in the middle and then the end and be like well this thing needs to. happen [ __ ] i wrote myself. into a corner ah what if i make up. this part where that in la. land you could do that. one thing yeah it's all mechanisms and tricks. like even men in black it's like oh we can wipe your memory. boom and it's also like here come the men. in black galaxy defenders is that. what they say the galaxy. defenders yeah i didn't know that yeah here come the man in black wow. all right so you want to. get into the [ __ ] shits. i want to. get directly into the [ __ ] brought to. you by super cult studios click and like the chris. listener chris evans caller. this guy's the [ __ ] i've been watching since day one big fan. day one was two weeks. ago my question is about [ __ ] a roommate do. you [ __ ] your roommate oh my god thought of it right then chris evans and thor. had a baby that can get complicated. uh so sexy so turning. us on hypothetically let's begin. sleeping with my roommate and she's become emotionally. involved despite uh being forward about. intentions and so what have you and and yeah thanks guys being so intentions dude. being so casual my question. is it had to. be quiet because his roommate's in the other room. no dude she's sucking him. while he's doing it. and he didn't want to. you want her to. know that he's doing the video. the question is about [ __ ] your roommate. so what's the deal with. that um so i'm talking about. how much was that guys i'm getting. sucked by her right. now dude that's bill. clinton that guy was basically bill. clinton you know what he is honestly. question should have been which marvel avenger. am i because he was in between. thor and also captain america. he actually really was um you're usually wrong. but that was right. i'm not usually wrong um so here's the thing. about what this guy's asking. about here's the thing. about what this guy's saying. he [ __ ] up so bad yeah yeah yeah and everyone in the entire [ __ ] universe knows that yeah in the marvel universe apparently except him what do you mean because that was obviously a bad idea to. do it though so he did it. already he did it. already okay he said what. do you mean oh cause she got. mostly involved yes people get mostly involved. before they even [ __ ] but that was obviously going. to happen with one of them. one of them was obviously. going to get more. emotionally involved in the other one. right because of obvious. life living because of obvious. life living this was obviously going. to happen all you had to. do was look at obvious. life livings of everyone. that's ever lived a life. wow and you would know that. some this is going to. be a bad [ __ ] idea i don't even want. to give him advice he [ __ ] did the dumb. thing but guys are stupid though. dude if you're a roommate. and she's gonna be walking around. obviously in not many clothes. because they're roommates and she's gotta get. ready and he's gonna catch a glimpse. of her [ __ ] you know what i mean. walking by with the door. open and he's just gonna go. like huh and then he's gonna one day. just be so stupid and drunk. why don't you like [ __ ] i'm sorry. your hand is a boner. and you're cool but you're a [ __ ] that is so dumb no. but here's the thing though. it happens all the time and somebody's probably gonna wind up. dead but the main thing is you just basically have to. not ever [ __ ] your roommate. ever it's oh unless you're prepared. to move because you gotta move. now yeah and guess what you gotta move. no matter what you to. either move if you work. out or don't work out if you don't work out. whania has to. move right obviously if you do work. out you still got to. move because she's never going. to be happy with the [ __ ] place that you have because it's probably too small and it was for roommates. exactly not for loving living. yes yes it's a deeper. and it's all good but that's the truth. so that is the truth. yeah so you [ __ ] up honestly shave and go into. the witness protectors program dude. don't don't [ __ ] ever just leave leave leave the country leave the country come to. america because you're obviously in canada. a boot dude that guy. also thickest canadian also the beard. just so canadian yeah. but um also wore carhartt which is [ __ ] super popular. in canada up up super north he's so canadian. he like carries around. an axe in case. he needs to. chop wood yeah and he never has a shirt. on even when it's snowing. but he has that hat on. it's like the guy from the simpsons. yeah yeah yeah um all right. so uh yeah dude you [ __ ] up but if the advice is what do you do now. you have two options. one move but that's the obvious. option you're gonna move two just be. real about it be like i think we made a mistake. is there any way. we could go back. to the way it was before. obviously the answer's gonna be no. but there's a slim chance it's yes. but those are your only two [ __ ] options. you you did a bad bad. bad mistake chris isaac baby. did a bad bad thing. isn't that that precise song baby. bad bad so i i think that he also it's too bad. that we're not in a scifi movie. because he could wipe her. memory and then just [ __ ] walk around and be like we didn't [ __ ] here come the men in black every song you sing is exact. the note is exactly the same. no matter the galaxy defenders. okay back um so yeah dude. you [ __ ] up get out. of it unless you love her. if you obviously if you are into. her then just continue the relationship. right yeah but you're you made a really bad. mistake that that's good when i do that. that is one of the good. things that song precisely had two good songs. on that set dude. wicked game in that. auto wicked [laughter]. [music] wow this jeez on. your dress in the oval. office hillary i'm so sad. such sadly back in the 90s. [laughter] [music] oh [ __ ] dude [music] same. it's exactly the same. arkansas and alabama's exactly the same. so rude what you did. alabama that what's the end. of the part at the end. of the song where he just starts. talking alabama in arkansas. he doesn't do that you should completely. make another isaac does it. no he doesn't at the end. of the game he just starts. at the end he just goes he's just like kind of trails off. and it's the end of the song. and the girls running at the beach. oh yeah yeah yeah i do it. helena christians running at the beach. or whatever her name is that video left. a real impression on me. yeah i know or you know. you too or you know. no i i know it. did to people but it didn't to. me why not um i was already. knowing what sex was at. that point so what you don't have to. not know what sex is to. to be have an impression. left the definition of an impression. um yeah but uh it was good. i just that she that lady. is not really my type you know. she was absolutely beautiful. yesterday beautiful most beautiful. woman i know she is and not my type so sue. me also i'm going to. take you to. court bill clinton as evidence [ __ ] linda tripp noah everyone thought monica was a [ __ ] now 20 years later they all think it's my fault. the same thing happened but opinions are different. nothing changed except people's minds. that's so weird where's lyrics. no news about it all right. let's do the next one. hi chris and matt big fan. of the podcast i just wanted to. ask you guys for some advice. so i moved in with my boyfriend. this past december we've been together. for three years now and the only issue. that i've had since we've moved in together. is that i am really the only person. that cleans or buys anything. for this house he does give me money. for stuff and like we split. the bill but i want help. like i don't want to. be the one that always has to. go to the grocery. store or the one. that always has to. clean everything and i don't want to. be naggy i don't want to. have to ask him. to do everything i don't want. to be his mom but at the same. time i don't feel like i should be doing everything. by myself and i just want him to. be more like selfaware of the things. in this home so do you guys have any advice. so that way i'm not the naggy girlfriend. but also too not doing everything. myself thanks guys i've got a great. i i it's interesting because here's the thing. i have to say. your boyfriend is me yeah. that's what i was going. to say yeah so maybe he should stay. out of this one and literally er that's the that's almost that's so ageold that [ __ ] that ageold [ __ ] thing about how it's like the dude is the dude and he doesn't do what i say well you know he doesn't clean yeah exactly which is she wants help dude my friends me dude that's a [ __ ] red flag if there ever was one yeah yeah yeah your boyfriend's him don't wanna clean okay okay okay so i think there's some cash don't worry about being the nagging girlfriend that is an unfair box like if you if you're worried about being that you're not gonna be that like that's this is kind of like a box that women get put in they get called the nagging girlfriend when like yeah they want a guy to. pick up dirty socks. and the guy's like i don't wanna. why are you nagging me. and it's like because your socks. are [ __ ] disgusting. they're not though probably no they're always disgusting. any sock that's been on the foot for an hour. or more is disgusting. they're not eating it it's just there. on the floor it's disgusting. to be there on the ground. it's fine no anyway uh just tell them. be like yo pick up [ __ ] after yourself and go get some [ __ ] sometimes no what do you mean no eat it. that's it eat the sock. nope just eat it eat. the eat eat the whole deal. just shut the [ __ ] up just re dude. he does what what does he do. that's good right he probably does. lots of things that are. good that's why she's with them. there you go so why would we complain. dude you're moving together what did. he do before before they moved. in together well he probably kept his place. dirty as [ __ ] because that's what he wanted and then he kept his what cupboards completely bare. i i don't know no. i bet he went [ __ ] grocery. shopping how about how about this though. kristen said why don't you just because i leave my [ __ ] places yes our place is not a mess no i leave my [ __ ] place why is it not a mess kristen no i i do do some tidying up but i will say this she said why don't you just do the dishes always do the dishes and that can be your thing and i'll do everything else and i say but the dishes. are the grossest part and she says exactly. so say okay so i do the dishes. mostly all the time right. um i should do them. probably all the time. but i have been making a conscious effort for why don't you delegate. [ __ ] right that's a good idea. delegate [ __ ] like i'll pick up. the [ __ ] and you do the [ __ ] grocery shopping come up. with things that he that you do. that he wouldn't mind. doing or will think of doing. yeah and then he can do that. all right because like if he's never going. to get groceries. he's never going to. clean up after himself. right you got to. figure out other things that he can. do 100 of the time. like i'm gonna i don't want kristen. to hear this but like if she asked. me to do laundry. some of the time i would do it. because i actually like doing whispering is it. gonna make a difference you're on a show. that goes out to. the entire world doing the laundry. kind of right but like i would do it. if she asked me. i would do it more. but i don't want her to. ask me to. do it more because sometimes i mostly want. to do other [ __ ] kristin ask chris to. do laundry what a wicked thing. to do if you ask me. to do laundry i go. on the road and make so find. out [ __ ] that he can do that he can think of on his own that he doesn't need to. be reminded of or nagged about. and then you have the things that you do. he has the things that he does. and hopefully it ends. up close to. 50 dude if i was him. and she said will you [ __ ] shop more or [ __ ] clean up. more i go like this. i'll bring home the bacon. and do a spin move what. if he doesn't bring him. well then he's yeah that's bad. dude that's just like she probably brings home. some bacon too though. that's so oldfashioned yeah i don't know i know but i'm all the fashion. i know you are but i'm trying to. say for [ __ ] her okay she's in a new age this isn't just a show for you. to talk about you these people. call in and have advice they seek advices. yeah true okay okay all right. so yeah delegation that's what it's all. about yeah and i thought of that. one okay next yep yep. hey guys so following situation. michael i'm a piano teacher. i give oneonone lessons is he michael. buble what the [ __ ] is it i have one student. um since the beginning of the year. pause it um what what is he holding a microphone. that's a microphone doesn't. need it well maybe he [ __ ] does i mean. he's so obviously russian. turn it up okay. okay okay turn it up. okay okay uh that's not the right. one start start it over though. yeah we're gonna start over baby. go ahead here we go. hey guys so following situation. um i'm a piano teacher. i give oneonone lessons and i have one. student since the beginning. of the year which i really like i flirt. with her she flirts with me poor. boy and one student she's seductive. with her eyes oh there's really something. going on there wow and i want to. make the next move but she's uh wearing a lot. of rings especially on on this. fella how many one. is what matters polygamist yeah. your pirates she's flirting. so much that it seems like she wants. more so i don't want to. ruin any marriage but i want to. find out if she's really married. married or not maybe she's a widow. i don't know so i want to. find out in a conversation um. maybe you have some um suggestions. some tricks some moves i could make how to. find out in a subtle. way my best move. so far is not very subtle. it's very confrontational asking here by. the way is this um engagement ring and if she might say yes why. then i could say i only wanted to. find out how much flirting. is appropriate that's my best. move so far maybe you have some ideas. for me robots that would be very great. um yeah much much love from germany. hell yeah thanks for doing. this um yeah goodbye doing i mean. dude all right well that the whole thing. just uh there's a lot of ways. we could start this one. i don't know what it's like in germany. but in america and if you're the teacher. yeah you can't yeah you know. this is your job. first things first you don't this. guy dude i don't [ __ ] her yeah i have had i no hello. i have one student since. the beginning of say yeah. i don't know that i would. like to [ __ ] her that was a language. very thing ruin my business. yeah in germany it is tradition. to ruin your whole business. he met one of his students. okay not as a language. barrier thing so so is the word. confrontational the thing i do is very confrontational. i say do you have a husband or are you. a video dude supposing that the husband. died is so german. dude i mean is how is she [ __ ] 65. dude i mean like did your husband die. dude okay this i mean there is so much. to [ __ ] unpack i think first of all what i'm curious. about is if she has a lot. of rings on on that. finger it's johnny. depp just ask why. do you have so many what's up. with that one finger you. have so many dude her hands are just so heavy. when she comes in one. hand is leaning down because it's the one. finger yeah the wedding. finger he's talking about so. go so she said she has so many rings yeah. so maybe she's a [ __ ] carny and she just like has rings all over. but you should say take off. your rings take off your rings to. play the piano it's easier. take off your engagement ring and if she says oh it's not. it's not an engagement ring hahaha. and he goes haha and then going for a kiss that's a little tricky. wrong all over the piano. it's a little tricky though. because i know you you don't want to. be like a sleaze roundabout just just you know ask but in a plain way like a nonconfrontational way just be like i noticed you have a lot of rings on that one finger. what what's that rank the. ranked rings in order from one. to nine no but okay. here's what i say don't. [ __ ] her obviously okay if you're if you want to. explore a love thing let's go. from this okay all you got to. do is say i mean. add it to. the [ __ ] uh lesson like if you're playing like picture your husband you love him very much right like this your husband what's his name she says either greg. then you know you got a husband okay. greg you love greg. and you playing for craig. if she says oh i don't have one. then go like this i oh really so that's very nice and then play and then you know. dude but how much flirting. is appropriate like you're [ __ ] kind of flirt. bot 2000 kind of none though. hello how are you how much flirt. before we commence less and i've noticed you have. nine rings i don't know which one is an engagement ring however. which how much flirtings is appropriate. with the microphone still it. doesn't need it didn't even. use it that's the only one. dude he has a microphone. and this was the only one that you said turn it. up yeah true doesn't need it. dude or needed it. more and held it too. far everything on that guy is beige dude. his skin his lips. his nose his hair his eyes everything's beige his shirt. was based he was a robot. he is a robot beige dude. maybe it's different in germany. as you pointed out but just don't don't ever. [ __ ] your student yeah okay i have one student. i'm trying to ruin my. business i'd like to. slide in and out of her bicycle. dude dude the one i don't know what move i. should do but the move i have. is very confrontational i put a gun on. her and i say do are you [ __ ] married. or not i say hands. up student are you married. or not yeah if she says yes i shoot her what did. he say did he say he did. that his move already. or he's thinking about he's thinking about doing the move. there's no move don't yeah. don't there is exactly there. is no move but do it. nicely dude germans are very you know what i mean direct and this is what i want but like dude just [ __ ] play around like your little like you're you know like you're you could add it in the lesson do you love your husband very much but that's a separate thing good okay then if there's no move and there's if there's no move to. be made because he shouldn't do it. then are you saying he still wants. to find out if she's married. or not because that's that. could be two separate. things yeah yeah yeah no i thought he wanted to. find out if she's married. or not because if it's a fake engagement or if she's not married. or if it's just a ring among. many rings and it's not an engagement ring then he would feel okay. to make the move but if she is getting. engaged it sounds like he still. wants to also see if it's that. serious because he could do that. [ __ ] stop thinking about doing that [ __ ] yeah yeah well at some point the lessons will probably end and at that point when things are not on a professional basis maybe you can explore but if you want to. know about the details before that. might happen i guess that's fair. but don't [ __ ] do [ __ ] or teach songs that are obvious. about what if she is. engaged obvious what you want. to do do you know. what i mean you could be like we're going. to learn this today's wicked game just two. notes so it's like so obvious. you're not even learning right. whatever game we play when you're absolutely married. but do some shady. sings with your piano teacher. just per se plays. out ding ding said it sing. she [ __ ] up piano teacher. she has [laughter] are you. engaged [laughter] goddamn oh. my god is it a real engagement so if the answer. is yes how serious is it. would you explore cramming so many words. in between would you explore. doing a horizontal wow okay. what do we get game. we play you come over. to learn piano and i got a boner. no hi all right i'm so [ __ ] beige so don't make a move don't make it is the solution. here yeah don't make a move. okay next i apparently drive. my soontobe fiance insane with the way. i microwave my food. i push the 30. second button over and over because it's [ __ ] expedient and i stand. by the microwave and i check to. make sure it's not too. hot or not too cold. and if it needs to. stay in there longer. it [ __ ] stays in there. longer it's not that big. of a deal but she draws issue. with the fact that she has to. get up

[music] [laughter] god damn it. greg in the back why. is everybody greg today you. pick one in your role with it. okay okay next one hey magical i was hoping i could get your advice. on something with only my friend. and uh chris i guess you could throw your opinion. in there too he and i are both. pretty antisocial people and it's hard. for us to. find a time where we both. want to spend time with one. another soon i'm going to. be going away to. college and that's his boyfriend. many hours away so i was hoping you guys. could give me some advice. on how i could find a way. to spend time with him. you talk about his boyfriend. who's he talking about best. friend oh can you uh i kind of i was unclear. about that from the beginning. you play that one again. actually yeah hey matt i was hoping i could get your advice. on something with my best. friend and uh chris i guess you could throw your opinion. in there too uh he and i are both. pretty antisocial people and it's hard. for us to. find a time where we both. want to spend time with one. another soon i'm going to. be going away to. college and that's going to. take me many hours. away so i was hoping you guys could give me some advice. on how i could find a way. to spend time with him. you guys gotta [ __ ] that's tough because you i mean when i think of antisocial. behavior i think of like you don't want. to like go to. [ __ ] parties yeah and be with big groups right but as a sometimes a very often antisocial. person myself right i i will often be not consider that. like oneonone [ __ ] oneonone [ __ ] is kind of better. and if if the issue is you're antisocial. and he's antisocial so you don't want. to hang out with each other. and it's hard to. find times to just want. to be around a living. human body that's a little bit trickier. i don't know but like i would say that. just make sure it's a thing. that the both of you. want to do and that it's just you guys. and that there's no like next thing. that you guys are going to. go to like an uh a [ __ ] party or whatever like no other people being invited. make sure it's like a [ __ ] chill relaxed. environment that like isn't going to. be interfered with by others. no he needs the metaverse. what's that mean he needs. to just plug into. the metaverse and find some [ __ ] what do they call the you know they go to. build a place in the metaverse. have the guy people meet this. is what antisocial people. do they get hooked into. the metaverse and they just chill. out dude what is it what are you saying it's like the matrix man. you just [ __ ] put on some vr. goggles and you go into. the metaverse and you chill. out and you [ __ ] so they share a space in the metaverse yeah they could even though they're alone that's something well you're alone yeah no i guess nobody is ever actually really in the metaverse i know so you're alone and you go into. the metaverse and you do whatever you want. and you meet up with that. dude and maybe you have a house. with that guy in the metaverse. but how do you [ __ ] each other it's not even gay. how do you have how do you meet up. with someone in the metaverse. what does that mean. your avatar meets another person's avatar can you plan to. meet somewhere yeah you can yeah or like text. them in the metaverse i guess. i don't really know how it goes. i'm not antisocial but you can go. do that i think you could [ __ ] each other. even if you're both guys. that's not gay what i would. suggest first and foremost. though is don't force it and because you feel like you have a clock. on it like this. idea of like oh no i'm leaving. for college i'm not going to. be able to. see him a lot i want to. hang out with him i want. to hang out with him. i want to. hang out with him you might just end up making it. weird not just for him. but also for yourself right. also weird pressure on yourself. and him yeah but you're going to. end up hanging out. with him again you'll be home. from college sometimes yeah you'll [ __ ] meet up you know it's up to. you guys but also the don't think of college. as the end of something. right it's not plus also the meta. versus no matter where you. are no matter where you are. you can hook into. your avatar and meet up with whoever the [ __ ] you want and be antisocial in the metaverse. but with someone else and technically you're still antisocial. you'll be at a party. and still be antisocial. because you're the metaverse. you're not actually doing it. that's why if you both. of you him and his friend. go back home and [ __ ] each other it's not even gay so two things why do you keep on bringing up the metaverse. he didn't do that and why. do you keep mentioning [ __ ] him in the metaverse. i'm suggesting be in the metaverse. because you can get out. all of the [ __ ] things that you want to. both ways antisocially and also socially because you're still being antisocial. when you're in the metaverse. because it doesn't really count. in real life which is why i'm saying if they [ __ ] each other it doesn't count as being gay. it seems like you're adding the last part. about [ __ ] for absolutely no reason. but that's okay i guess these guys. need to yeah it's uh if also dude. you know what is he going. to college so here's the other thing. yes um you're not gonna be probably friends. with this guy anyway in five years. so it's fine that. might be true. but it that doesn't see you can't. say that though because him now is friends. with him like you can't. be like don't worry about it. it's like you can't tell the kid. like right that's true. problem that you are crying. over that's true when you're [ __ ] 20. isn't going to matter. worth [ __ ] no you can't really say that. that's true dude but i am gonna. say that as a father. i mean you would be right. but yeah it's gonna [ __ ] up the kids. i think that honestly uh it'll be uh yeah i don't i i mean. the other guy are they worried. about the relationship what's this. guy worried about is the other guy. worried he wants to. hang get the mac that's what i was saying. before about there being a clock on it. yeah he wants to. make sure he maximizes their potential time. together before he moves. hours away it's a weird dichotomy though. because he wants to. hang out with the guy. but he also it was saying i'm an antisocial. but if he's antisocial. and he's okay with it then why. does he want to. be [ __ ] social yeah maybe maybe you just need to. be maybe you're you are not. that antisocial yeah you might not be maybe he is maybe the other guy. is yeah in which case. try to [ __ ] get him. into the metaverse. just tell him dude. like i'm leaving soon like let's hang as much as much as you can and as much as you're down. like let's hang because i'm around. and i really want to. hang with you before i go. as much as we can yeah. badaboom that's good that's good advice. yeah okay next hey what's up. guys my name is mitch. i love the show every episode's been great. dude oh yeah i'm a huge fan. of both of you guys keep doing. what you're doing and get your dad. on the show please anyways. body odor oh that's the question.

[ __ ] put on deodorant you get sued. for that he's not gonna say. that that's the way he's calling in that's what. i'm saying so we talk about the things you do. do and the things that you don't. do so don't do that. okay right especially if he's [ __ ] his boss which he says he's his partner so maybe not maybe you know what they are they made their detectives right. um maybe they're in like a pod. together he can't get away. yeah yeah which is awful. um [ __ ] man walk in with a [ __ ] one of those things like a [ __ ] clothespin and then i'd be like what are you doing and be like what do

are that's who your soul is your soul stinks. like [ __ ] body odor is who you are but i'm french about. that man okay well you're not french. about [ __ ] breath no because that's who you are no. you

halitosis is not regional. buddy i know that but like sometimes. when you some korean guys when they're going. oh okay wow there's a [ __ ] there's a there's a weird thing. too where your your sense. of smell for someone the way. your nose interacts with someone else can actually change over. time yep and i wouldn't bank. on that i wouldn't bank. on your nose just suddenly. being okay with this [ __ ] coworker especially now that it's lodged in your head. but i used to. be around someone someone i dated uh who smelled great. in the beginning of my relationship. and then as it soured as the relationship. got worse i swear. at the end she smelled like cat. piss but do you know. why you know why. that happened though honestly actual cap i know. i know it's because i didn't like her. and then after you guys started. dating a little bit i would take cat piss. i put under your nose. oh dad yeah you ruined. it you're like a cat. piss dude cat piss. cat piss has it. been the other way sometimes it. has been the other way. i used to. hang out with a guy who had bad. smells and then i realized oh it's not so bad. and i don't know if i changed or he changed. her butt i'm not getting.

[ __ ] have any hair and yeah any job dude you could be a doctor if you wanted yeah i mean a hundred percent yeah yeah i mean a certain kind of doctor you could be operating with that [ __ ] you know yeah yeah although if you tied it up [ __ ] it yeah no he's just like [ __ ] forceps put his [ __ ] beard away um first of all yeah i mean i don't know man that's just annoying. man your family that's so annoying. here's what i think they say. it's not professional but what they just what. they mean all they mean. is they want you to.

[ __ ] man it's still there's that old way of thinking this like don't take medication you know but also australia is like a little bit behind on the time don't they get cold later maybe they have a different view. of it but dude. take it yeah dude. try it at least i mean. talk to a doctor about it. don't like buy it on the [ __ ] street go. to [ __ ] downtown and get it but like snort it if a doctor prescribed it for you in the past. and it's an actual clinical. problem that you have ostensibly still then [ __ ] and you're having potential trouble on the horizon. or experiencing something that you could. be that you could benefit from. being on the same medicine. again what the [ __ ] do it take it i had yeah yeah i had really bad i have really bad ocd. as you guys know probably if you're [ __ ] if you listen to. me ever but like i have really bad. ocd and i didn't want to. take medication for the longest. time and then finally i was like if it ever gets in this. was back when i was like 26. something 25 i was like if it ever. gets in the way of my work. i'll start taking medication if my ocd. ever starts getting in way. my work and then one night it. did get in the way of my work. and i thought that's it. i remember i gave myself. an ultimatum and i started taking medication. the next day because i already had it. i already had it i just never took it i started. taking medication the next day. dude it [ __ ] really takes the edge off. [ __ ] man like my ocd isn't as bad um i mean i still struggle with it and i'm still me you know what i mean sometimes people aversion to. taking medication is i'll lose. myself but you don't dude. you become a better version. of yourself i mean it's 2022. the medication's around for a reason. it's not like everyone's [ __ ] hoodwinked into. taking this [ __ ] yeah you know um so yeah i mean i think that it's a good. thing to do why. didn't you why did you have an aversion to. taking it because i thought i was gonna lose. myself here's the thing though and don't take offense. to this you're a [ __ ] piece of [ __ ] you're not gonna [ __ ] you're not that great in the first place i was great and you know scrooge mcduck the thing the thing that everyone is so like nervous i hear that a lot yeah you're not that great like you're not the great great just take this [ __ ] you'll be better for yourself and everybody else you're not that [ __ ] great take the medicine good i was great but yeah and i am great but yeah wow yeah okay okay so you're the exception but yeah nah there's a few exceptions it's like me [ __ ] tiger woods and jesus but it's like you know you don't want to take the [ __ ] too much [ __ ] and uh but yeah i get it dude i get it but yeah if it worked for you when you were 10 and if shit's getting in the way now if you're mental [ __ ] then you know um try it and try it for three months try it for four months sometimes it takes a long time for it to kick in anyway you probably won't even realize it and if you've got 80 adhd yeah yeah eft sucks get on some [ __ ] talk to a doctor let them [ __ ] make you feel better i know people with adhd and dude they don't even know where they are sometimes what well i mean not you know i mean not actually not know where they are but i'm just saying it's like they do [ __ ] and you're just like what the [ __ ] going on and they're like sorry i i don't and then you get frustrated it [ __ ] people's lives up okay well there you go there you go i can do it subscribe to the clips channel dude we put out the clips and [ __ ] share the clips and share um share it uh subscribe to super cult studios on this is where this podcast is and if you have a question if you have a question click on the link in the description below or go to watchlifeline dot com and uh you know chrisalia dot com for tickets i am on tour go to crystalia dot com oh i didn't announce albany i'm gonna be in albany too but uh go there and uh and uh you can get this merch here uh chrisley dot com but anyway watch lifetime watch lifeline dot com for uh submissions we really enjoyed doing the show it's. been a lot of fun. yeah and uh thanks you guys. you guys have merch coming. out soon oh yeah we have merch coming out. too soon too so stick. uh stick around for that. we'll be uh announcing it. soon and if all of you don't buy. some of it and put it on and take pictures. and send in your video submissions with it. on i'm gonna [ __ ] rage and cry every single day. of my life okay you need to. get on medication then but yeah guys thanks. for listening and leave comments. appreciate you hello hello.
