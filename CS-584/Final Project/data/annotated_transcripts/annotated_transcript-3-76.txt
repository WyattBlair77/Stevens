[ __ ] he's got blood on his hands like they left that part. in anyway i digress. i digress dude i digress. church is just like it's just like bad. you know it's like it's like you know i get it. too because you think like businesses. like nobody thinks they're evil. right like even hitler. was like yeah you know i mean. okay i understand people think what i'm doing. bad but you know we got to. get these jews out of here. like that's what [ __ ] feel you know it's better. for look i get it. but it's better for everyone. let's just get this superior. race fired up right we're doing. a lot of mixed race. [ __ ] and then brown babies are coming out. right let's just start with these jews. let's move them out. and trust me like that's and he didn't think. he was a bad guy. he was he thought he needed to. do what he needed to. do and yes it's awful. and yes hitler deserves to. get the electric chair and [ __ ] multiple [ __ ] of his ass but still let's just get one thing straight nobody thinks that they're a bad person you see [ __ ] dicks out there dude comedians are the worst people okay you see them out there dude all these you know everyone thinks that they're [ __ ] yucking it up and like everyone's a good guy because they're telling jokes being jovial they're [ __ ] [ __ ] and they're narcissist in the [ __ ] 90 i hate when people say people are narcissists. so i don't know if they're narcissists or not. because i'm just somebody like everyone's diagnosing everybody. on [ __ ] twitter i have no idea who's a narcissist who knew who's not but like dude. nobody thinks they're a bad. guy so this dude is probably compartmentalizing. everything about how you know or anybody who has a mega church. and they're wearing [ __ ] gucci [ __ ] shoes. and like they're carrying around. like you got those [ __ ] old black pastors with the [ __ ] louis vuitton bags. which is [ __ ] goddamn hilarious. you know they get like a five thousand. dollar bag and a red suit. like they're [ __ ] steve harvey and um and they fly in private jets. and they're like yeah but you know. without me like people don't like you know. people don't have this community. where they so i kind of deserve. it you know that's what they're thinking and they're [ __ ] leerjet i mean. like without me these kids. would probably be doing drugs. and they're instead they're just coming together. and singing him songs. i don't see what the i don't see. what the big problem. is in their [ __ ] r as they're riding their white tiger so it's like so i so you get caught up. right there's a difference between hitler. and the guy who buys a louis. vuitton bag with tithing that's all. i'm saying and it's bad yes but you have to. understand these people are compartmentalizing. a lot of these people are dealing. with issues that they have themselves. it's like the whole thing. if you knew everyone's story you couldn't hate them. that's all i'm saying so these [ __ ] documentaries are becoming a little bit. irresponsible and and you watch it. i'm watching the thing and i get like oh i get into. it i'm like yeah this. [ __ ] but i'm like wait they're just telling their side. of the stories dude it is crazy. man it is crazy. everybody sins doesn't don't they dude. everybody sins sometimes oh. sometimes you steal money. sometimes you [ __ ] outside a marriage every but sometimes you eat too much. glut needs to sin. for some reason everybody sins. wise gluttony a sin i get all the other ones but why is gluttony a sin eating. is a sick dude. getting a gordita taco bell. [laughter] is a sin. sometimes oh getting extra sauces. and chickfila is a sin. get the extra sauces. but anyway dude religion is like if you're going to. religion if you're going to. big business church if you're going. to big business churches. guess what they're stealing. your money and be okay. with that but it's entertainment. them big business mega churches. that [ __ ] is entertainment. has nothing to. do with jesus christ guess. what jesus christ is just [ __ ] kind of just you know dead you know is it coming back i don't know didn't come back. yet that's the other thing. too when people are like bro. i don't believe in the afterlife i don't believe. in jesus i don't believe in [ __ ] god [ __ ] all that you don't know. though right do you right. like let's just take a step. back you don't know like a lot. of people think like oh i probably don't believe. in [ __ ] like that and i don't but also like i don't really know you could die. and literally there could only be hell you. could die and lit. and you could die. and literally everyone then goes to. a huge ikea and you just gotta put furniture together. for the rest of eternity. you don't have a [ __ ] clue you could die. and then immediately come out as another new baby. you don't know so that's why. when i see these priests. or pastors that are like the word. of the lord is true. you don't know though right. why do you know. because i have faith aka. you don't know if you have to. rely on faith you don't. know that's what faith is you. have faith when you don't have proof so if you don't got proof and you know you don't got proof you go like this k. but faith though oh and i could easily be a [ __ ] leader of a mega church. you think i can't dude. i would do it i actually was watching that. hill song [ __ ] and i was like oh dude your boy missed. his calling actually yeah i'm funny. and boy is that nice but when it. comes to the gift. to gab hello gift. of gab airline gift of gab. airlines we'll be taking off. we're going to go. into the goddamn stratosphere boom. i'm crystalina sit tight here. we go take off. like one of those [ __ ] gi joe jets. just not even with a oh dude. you thought we needed a runaway. yeah everybody sins eating. the sin for some reason. just have a salad. ranch is a sin. though who decides these sins jesus. christ the bible that [ __ ] was dude we're canceling. books way from way less long ago. you can't even read like huck. finn because it has the n word. in it you're gonna who wrote the bible. too oh who did it. i'm just saying that i digress. so i could easily be one of those. [ __ ] oh man the gift. of gab dude chur the chur. i mean dude i need to. start it that's the thing. i need to start. at church i really went about this. cult thing the wrong. way but i'm glad you're in the congratulations. cult thank you very much. for listening and i know a lot. of people [ __ ] think that guy's so full of himself. you don't [ __ ] even understand goddamn. comedy do you god people really take everything. so seriously like you look. at tick tock comments. and it's just uh it's just like okay. oh okay okay got it your brain. hasn't developed fully. yet how old are you. 30 ah guess sad life i took a [ __ ] dude we went hiking the other day it was absolutely so fun i had no idea it was gonna be that fun i was all right man you know you get out sometimes you get outside in nature and [ __ ] and it's just like i don't like when people are like yo there's always somebody if you go hiking in a group somebody says something like you know it's just great getting back to. nature and you're like not even that. far from a [ __ ] highway right like isn't outside just nature right oh you got to. be near one tree and it's nature. like you even in new york. city there's [ __ ] roses. cracking out of the sidewalks basically that's nature. too so don't get all high and mighty. just because you're in [ __ ] you know in a lake in the ozarks. by the way that's manmade. so it's like but um so we're there and somebody's like it's great. to get back to. nature and i'm like i don't dude. i don't deal with those. kinds of things being said on hikes and so i cut that real quick. i nipped that in the butt. and and my other buddy. was like there's pot my. buddy dan was like there's poison ivy. be careful and i'm like what's it. look like and he's like i'll show. you if i see it. and then he's like oh there it. is i said really and he said i think so i'm like all. right well so if you don't know you don't know dude. well i guess we'll just know if there was poison. ivy in a day. or so when i start itching. like the dickens so um we're on this. hike and it's not a crazy hard. hike but we're running you know your boys. trying to get into. the [ __ ] you know you know summer's coming. so that's all i'm saying summer's. coming so that's all i'm saying your boy's gonna be dressed like a [ __ ] brick [ __ ] house without his shirt on isn't that right.

uh on my second. channel more crystallia go to. that youtube channel subscribe and like and also make friends. in these comments too now's a good. time to do it. but so we went on. a hike and we're doing it. and then there's like it's me. mike linoche and my buddy dan. um and we get to. this spot where he's like dan's like we should go. over to the [ __ ] to. the rock and i'm looking in there's like a really narrow. way to do it. we got this on the video. but i was like oh yeah okay and mike. was like bro that's too narrow. we can't do that and i'm like bro. don't come on don't be a [ __ ] and then even the camera guy with the camera. is like i can do it. and mike's like don't do. it you're holding a camera. dude you could fall off the cliff. so we ended up doing it. and we got there to. the rock and my buddy. dan is always wanting me. to take pictures of him. it's really [ __ ] i mean you know he's got like 15. 000 followers on instagram which is cool. but he's always like bro.

[ __ ] and that's basically what the oscars. is also you're just [ __ ] saying lines you know what i'm talking about um i i just the uh i got a i actually got um invited to. some of the oscar parties and i i i j. through some a friend of mine. and i i don't know if um i didn't go. i'm not gonna go but um yeah man. i don't know i was thinking about going. like these things like i just feel [ __ ] uncomfortable man. you know what i realized i [ __ ] actually have social anxiety. like i definitely have like a lot. of social anxiety. like i'm not sure how to. be unless i'm at like a comedy. club or people know who i am or if i'm on right. if i'm like performance mode on like that's a flip. you have to. switch like i'll be honest. with you before today before. this podcast today i i was extremely anxious. all day i woke up anxious. i texted my friends i'm like man. i can't shake this. anxiety um i felt awful. i actually [ __ ] cried a little bit i just couldn't i couldn't like i felt like how am i gonna do this podcast but i have to. do this podcast and i wanted to. get it out um and i was like i think i can do it. i'm a professional let's see. if i can do it and then i sat. down and engagement and performance mode. engagement like you don't want me. in podcast you know how i'm saying like podcast. mode is what we call it right. you know how drake gets in album. mode your boy gets some podcast mode and when i'm in podcast mode ain't nobody's safe okay so i had to. be in podcast mode and i don't know if i'm at the point. in my life in my recovery. do you know what i mean. through my therapy as being in podcast. mode when i'm at a party with a bunch of [ __ ] suits you know when you're walking the [ __ ] red carpet i don't know if i'm in that [ __ ] mode i don't know you know and then even like kristen was like yeah maybe it's a good idea you know you just go and you you test the waters and and you [ __ ] see how you know and i just don't know man like i wanted so badly to. be in hollywood and and then i i like after. all this [ __ ] like i think about like i think about it and i think about why you know like i i actually think about why like shooting army of the dead. was in the hot hot desert um. of albuquerque albuquerque is not fun especially when you're too hot. you were waiting around you. know the production was awful. and like i shot this. movie and i was like cool. but i was like i you know i met. some cool people but like it's not fun. it's not fun like acting is barely. fun unless you're out there. really with the meat on the bones. you know like christian bale well you want. me to gain 60. pounds for a roll let's do it. i mean i would never do. that but like you know. what i mean i'll grow. a mustache i'll shave my head but like you know you're basically acting. and you and your the whole thing. is is like this will be cool. to watch one day so i cancel the tour. uh fly to albuquerque. for two months shoot this. [ __ ] movie it's horror the horrible. production everyone's bitching and moaning during it. the negative energy is just astounding i'm. dealing with some of these actors that are by. the way great people but not every time. you're on set there's always one. or two actors where you're like oh this.

[ __ ] but activist has become a very loose term if you haven't noticed dude you post a black square on instagram and your four black lives matter oh really but what'd you do though did you take a club out of someone's hand no you just posted something that's nothing i did it whoopsie. daisy i took it down because it's nothing. you're not doing anything if you're not doing. anything then don't do it but don't virtue. signal and then it was to. stop asian hate and then if you don't do it. silence is violence no dude silence is silence we've been over this there's a clip of it you can google it silences violence. crystallia he was given a plane. ticket by a generous. donor and it arrived in lev on march. 4th eager to. sign up but quickly. discovered that the lesion was illequipped and disorganized. they couldn't guarantee me a weapon well. yeah that's just because you [ __ ] showed up without a plus one [ __ ] you showed up to. war with your [ __ ] hands. and your slacks just like you. guys need me dude. you're not a [ __ ] warrior you're an antipoverty. activist you want a gun that's like ti. trying to do standup. but you don't do it. though that's like soulja boy. trying to make video games. you don't do it though. i'll buy nintendo it's like when [ __ ] uh bruce willis. came out with a band it's like when kevin bacon. wanted to make the bacon. brothers you don't do it though hey i'm gonna build. a house and even though. i'm a comedian you're all gonna come in. and live in it. and then we do that. and then it rains and we get all. wet why because i don't build. houses um i'm not going anywhere. near russia without a weapon so i bailed on all that er gave up it got a little bit tough they didn't have turkey sandwich they didn't have my rider so i bounced um it's hard to. verify the numbers it's likely. that thousands of people from around. the world have joined. the ukraine uh cause and uh provided crucial support. on the battlefield but some foreign. fighters found the experience frightening and dangerous. it's like walking into. mcdonald's and being like sup. with all these burgers. like you get what you get dude. so that's so [ __ ] heh um did you see the [ __ ] uh i love the elizabeth home [ __ ] cause i don't know that much about it but to. me it seems like like i know what she did. was [ __ ] horrible like because she but here that's the other thing like she didn't think she's a bad person she was just like we'll get the money and if i just say we can [ __ ] make the product i'll get the money and then i'll get the money and then we'll make the product and that's so so so what agents do in hollywood so she was probably like it's all good i mean agents in hollywood do that all day long they'll be like you know yadda yadda is interested in it and you're like really okay i'll do it and then they're like cool and then they call the other guy and they're like you know crystally is interested in the other guy's like oh really oh cool i'll do it then and then they [ __ ] do it nobody was interested in it an agent just [ __ ] lied. and agent elizabeth holmes this. project together this stupid project about [ __ ] vamp like vampires [ __ ] caa elizabeth holmes their way into.
