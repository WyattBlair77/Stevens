[ __ ] everyone's always like we want [ __ ] we want the homeless we want the homeless uh uh to. be able to. have houses and we want you know. uh uh no hunger and [ __ ] peace bro are you kidding. me you gotta start with the [ __ ] cream dude you gotta start with expanding white chicks minds with different. colors and i'm just saying and it's fine. what's happening over in ukraine. is an absolute travesty. obviously do i know. anything about it no i have one. friend that's pro putin and it's really [ __ ] weird it's really odd that he's proputin i don't know anything about it all i know is if you were to. like come out on social. media about supporting putin you'd lose. all your [ __ ] jobs that's all i know and my buddy is really secretly into. putin and it's very weird. and i've gotta [ __ ] figure out what the hell's going. on so i know if i could you know. but it is what it is. patreon dot com crystalia um it is what it. is dude i you know i'm a i'm uh i don't know i don't i don't think you know. i just don't i'm not look. i can just come out and say some basic. [ __ ] like war isn't the answer. and i don't think war. is the answer right. because it's like i don't know it's guys. with their egos and [ __ ] and it's like if you were gonna be a [ __ ] i think i was one parent away. from being a [ __ ] warlord or a dictator for real. and i'm not joking which is one. parent away i don't even know which one but if i if you mixed one parent one of my parents up with another parent just with the way they are instant warlord i've always you know i've said that um so yeah i don't know what's going on in the world though i try to. stop i don't want to. listen to the news. i know it's like be educated and [ __ ] i was talking to. my therapist about this earlier. but i was like dude. i can't stand when these [ __ ] actors are just like out. there like we need to. stop what's happening in ukraine. and you're like oh really dude. oh really oh yeah oh oh is that. what we're supposed to. do [ __ ] uh you know fourth lead in yellowjackets or whatever the [ __ ] that show is on hbo oh yeah is that what we're supposed to. do you're posting the ukrainian flag. oh yeah thanks thanks third. lead in super pumped [laughter]. all right yeah thanks [ __ ] you know that. [ __ ] show super pumped. you know i had to. check it out because just jason gordon levitt's in it you know i had to. check that [ __ ] out because joseph joseph levitt [ __ ] whatever his name have two names. dude you know have two names. if you [ __ ] want somebody to. do like joseph gordonlevitt you're a you're a [ __ ] you're a [ __ ] sucker you know that right like you're a [ __ ] straight up like if you're a guy that's just like oh i'm actually like thomas hayden church how first of all he [ __ ] it up tom church is the illest name dude why would you want to. if your last name is church. why would you want to. spend the extra time. saying your middle name when you could get right. to church dude if my if my i'm telling you right. now dude if my second name if my last name. was church oh dude. well first of all i would have never got cancelled. i would be literally fro i'll. probably be one of the top. comics chris church i mean. i am one of the top. comics but i probably would be one. of the even more tapas comics. chris church dude tom church. is the [ __ ] and this guy's trying to. [ __ ] space it out with hayden. that's that's crazy to. me honestly that's why thomas hayden church. biggest role was either sideways. or the sandman in one. of the spider movies if it. wasn't he would be the rock. um so i watched uh fear thy neighbor. which is another show that's just creepy. where like you gotta dude. i watch the show fear thy neighbor. and it's like one of those shows. that like ins that like you find like we we signed. up for discovery plus and like it's just one. of those shows that that you are like huh. what's this it shows like half a person's body. on the [ __ ] on the icon. and it just just fear thy. neighbor like it's cut into. the into wood and it's like so bad. it's probably wanted to. watch it because it's so beige the [ __ ] the the icon for it is so beige it's like it was made by studio mcgee fear thy neighbor studio mcgee and uh so we we click it and it's one of those shows that like they're oh there's just 11 seasons of it you know how where the [ __ ] do these shows get off being 12 years old already you know i'm talking about like how do i not know a show this is the state right now of the entertainment industry the fact that i don't know a show that i can possibly not know what a show is or that it exists and it's already in season 12. how is it beyond season four and i don't and i don't know about it there's just too many shows out there so we put on sphere the neighbor and we start watching it and it's like about these awful neighbors that just lose their mind and there's [ __ ] literally let's see so it's six episodes in season one i don't know there's probably more episodes in the next season so let's just do the math so six times 11 seasons so that's 66 there's at least 66 shows which means there's different episodes of neighbors losing their mind and on this show it's not just the neighbors losing their minds it's the neighbors goading the people who live there to. lose their minds their self so that's doubling it. so it's 66 times. two so that's what uh 112. right isn't that what 66. times 2 is your boy's real. good at math isn't he is. it is that even what it. is 66 times 2 hey. series what's 66 times 2 hey. siri what's 66 times 2. hey siri what's 60 [ __ ] 132. whoa he was so close [ __ ] yeah dude he couldn't have been [ __ ] [music] [applause] closer what do you say 112 it doesn't matter math. was never a strong suit. but he [ __ ] yeah he's got the gift. of god no nothing oh god. and is that what gets you further. on in life yeah he got a d. [ __ ] he got a d plus in algebra two but my god he got that thing [music]. but did he get a [ __ ] back rated english yeah he did too as a matter of fact but did he create his own. way of speaking yeah and then he's got people behind him. he's got an army. behind him with [ __ ] people understand what he's saying yeah he does so anyway dude so now we're watching feel the neighbor so it's doubling it so it's 66 times two that's what is it 132 132 so now what my point is it's not that just just the neighbor that's crazy it's the person that lives there that's crazy so that's 132 crazy people through the span of this show now those are just the ones that they pick for the best episodes and guess what happens in the best episodes one of the neighbors kills the other one okay so these are the most extreme some of these episodes a few people end up dying so these are the most extreme versions of the craziest people that are neighbors in the world okay so my thing is if people like this are so crazy and they're just out there being neighbors and 132 of them are in a show about it how many are there in real life number one and number two let's just jump right to. it how can you ever. trust anything anyone says in history i'm just gonna meet someone and believe them. dude these people meet it. starts off nice as [ __ ] these shows these shows are just like tom was there. and he moved in and he noticed that. there was something weird and a dog came by and [ __ ] peed on his fence and and then there was a broken bottle so the other guy got really mad and he started teaching his kids how to. how to [ __ ] march. like an army outside. of the house with guns. in their hands and you're like whoa. whoa wait a second it. started nice so how could you believe. anything anyone ever says dude. if there's not so neighbors out. there these are just neighbors. again they're not people in the military. that have like scarred [ __ ] you know like a guy with a scarred past. that like liam neeson would play. right these are all [ __ ] insane people that you don't know about it they're over undercover. insane so the other thing. is why are we listening to. anybody on the internet. and this is the main point i wanted to. drive home because if you're meeting people. that are neighbors and they're twofaced. or you don't know their mental. capacity or how broken their brain. is then how can you trust somebody you. don't know that you meet and then beyond. that how can you trust somebody. behind a keyboard that might not even. be the person who's tweeting. they might be someone else. and we'll just go along. with it the guy from jeopardy. doesn't have a job anymore. these people are all your [ __ ] crazy neighbors fear thy. neighbor dude fear thy everyone just [ __ ] hole up love your family right i don't know man i want to. not trust people like i want. to do a little bit. more like tupac you know. in my own life i want. to be a little bit more. like [ __ ] you know what i mean. [ __ ] but like i'm not that guy i can't i'm not you know i want to. be [ __ ] tupac so bad you know what i mean. like [ __ ] your [ __ ] i'm so kind of i want to. you know i want to. get that thug life tatted. across my belly you know. what i mean i want to. be like [ __ ] your [ __ ] but i'm like too nice you know i really am my son. changed me dude and not that. i was ever [ __ ] tupac like [ __ ] absolutely [ __ ] but like i am now even softer than i've ever been and i want to. not trust people but then i meet them. and they look me. in the eyes and i smile at them. and then i realize that you know. yeah my smile is a little bit. intoxicating and theirs might be disarming. but guess what i'm right. there too and my smile's disarming. as well so now we're both unarmed just intoxicating the [ __ ] out of each other. and i hope that you're not [ __ ] gonna have a broken brain. and i'm gonna figure it out. too late with a knife. in my belly be careful. out there that's all i'm saying man. i did get a [ __ ] d in algebra though. and like a c in english. when i was in high school. but who cares [music]. all right listen up. you guys i want to. talk to you about a little thing. i like to call. ship station and the reason. why i like to. call it that is because it's called that online. shopping isn't slowing down anytime. soon of course it ramps. up and up and up. and up is your business. ready to keep up. the pace that's the big. question well with shipstation you'll never worry about. shipping again make the switch. to a solution that handles. all of your shipping needs. quickly affordably and painless shipstation. is already trusted by over. 100 000 ecommerce sellers all right. keep track of orders from any sales. channel easily find the best. shipping carrier with deeply discounted rates. automate just about any shipping. task with just a few clicks. my favorite thing about shipstation. is for me crystallia. all uh of the fans like happily getting their orders and getting them quickly. fast with like it's like hasslefree it's just the best. i use ship station so uh you should too. man um you save time. by funneling all of your orders into. one simple interface no matter what you're selling. or where you're selling. manage every order amazon ebay. etsy or even your own. website uh from anywhere even your phone. everyone's doing everything on their phone. lately you save money also when you uh you can compare the carrier. options and choose. the best shipping solution every single time. uh and honestly the best thing. the biggest thing for me. is save your sanity. because you can know. your orders are handled. and you're getting the best rates. that's what shipstation does uh gives you. the best rates so make shipping the easy. part of having an online. store it's already stressful enough. you have bigger ideas to. think about and handle 98 of companies that. use shipstation for a year. keep using it for as long. as they're in business. case close it's that good ship. more in less time with shipstation. use my offer code okay. the offer code is congrats. to get a 60 day. free trial that's two months free two months. free no hassle stress free. shipping just like i said all of the things. above just go to. shipstation dot com click on the microphone. at the top of the page. and type in congrats ship station make ship happen. yo what's up want to. talk to you a little bit. about these things called. blenders man check out. these sunglasses what the heck why are they so ridiculously. cool it's not just cause i'm wearing. them dude i love them. but they're called blenders eyewear. and they got tons of styles and colors for their sunnies whether you want a sleek all black look to. be understated or to. stand out with bright. colors and wrap around lenses they got it all the quality is second to. none every pair is built to. last with incredible attention. to detail and almost all sunglasses come polarized you know. how cool they are check them. out i love them. because uh i got a few of them. and when i'm in party. mode i could just rock around. and just be be out and just be kind of cool. with them and people be like what are those. sunglasses and i'm like blenders um they have more than just sunnies. there's prescription sunglasses and eyeglasses. blue light glasses and even snow. goggles and yo they have helmets. so go check it out. uh is a 45 day. satisfaction guarantee get 15 off by going to. blenderseyeware dot com and using the code. chris dalia vip these sunglasses. are awesome got them in my car. got them in my house. got him everywhere. and i just throw him. on and immediately i'm in party. mode [music] i'm just like it's a shame that we have to. deal with other people's crazinesses. like i've got a but like everyone has their own.

[ __ ] chicken sandwich chef's kiss and the fries. chef's kiss all right. now i'm doing that and then i go and i leave and i get in my car. yes i'm all [ __ ] you know i'm inside. the [ __ ] uh right the bloody guts. and i get home all's well. that ends well i get in my bed. you know probably argue about what tv. show we're gonna watch a little bit with krista. and then i go to. sleep and i wake up. the next morning had an awful. night's sleep and i remember this because i went back to. sleep after i ate breakfast. i cooked breakfast for me. and calvin and we ate right. like father and son and we had a good time. and then i went to. sleep at 11 30 again okay. i went to. sleep at 11 30 again and then i wake up. to kristen saying chris and immediately the tone in her. voice my heart my heart's gonna explode. okay because i've had a rough two. years and when somebody comes up. and says hey hey chris hey chris in the dead. of sleep my heart's gonna blow up. right so i wake up. out of this deep sleep and my heart's pumping so i say what's up. and she says um okay. i don't know but like i don't know when this. happened but the back passenger. window of your car is. completely shattered like somebody was trying. to break in so now. i realize it's okay to. be anxious because what the [ __ ] happened last night okay so i go outside and as clear. as day i mean my [ __ ] window in the back. right is just splintered as all. get out and somebody tried. to either take a rock. or a screwdriver and puncture it. 19 times i counted 19. times dude we did it. because i've got a [ __ ] nanny that's a real real. like sleuth like that's why. she also likes to. watch the [ __ ] like feel the neighbor because she's a real sleuth she'll be like well it was punctured 19. times and it looked like it was done. by a professional but i don't think they were actually trying. to steal your car. because why would they try. to do it in the back. left window when they when when when if you're going. to try to. steal a car you just go. to the closest window. and that's the driver's side. you just crawl in and then drive away. and i was like aha very good but why did they come down. here and try to. steal something while i was sleeping. at night in my house. so i got really nervous because la is a [ __ ] dumpster fire. right now you know that. because of how you can just rob. a car and they'll let you okay. so now i'm like well [ __ ] man these who ever gonna do they're gonna come again. because right because you hear that. thing where it's like oh the banks. that gets that get robbed. they get robbed again. so i'm like well [ __ ] now they're gonna try to. come for my car tonight. so guess what your boy. did your boy doesn't [ __ ] around. i hired armed security dude. i hired armed security they. showed up this dude. looked like a ball player. he was just like what's up. i got armed security. outside of my house like i'm the goddamn president. so i hired armed security. and as the night fades i go. outside and i look at the i look at the car. and i can't see really the splintering. so i find that odd. and so kristin was like well if you couldn't see it. then maybe it happened while you were at swingers. the other night and i go. yeah that makes much more sense. it happened when i was at swingers. because at night when i walked back. from swingers i couldn't see the [ __ ] window being splintered and it didn't happen. at my house because why the [ __ ] would it happen. at my house if it was gonna happen. on my house it would be the front window. and somebody would try to. steal the car and they wouldn't give up it. was probably just a crazy. person walking on beverly boulevard. that [ __ ] said some [ __ ] like science is everywhere and then bashed my window in and i was like there we go maybe they just heard about the bloody guts. and they wanted to. see it for their own. man you know what i mean. i don't know so uh i had two nights. of the armed security. and it's nice to. know i can get arm security. when i want to. the guy was bawling. though the guy was cool. as [ __ ] he was like what's up sir. i'm here he had a gun. and he was ready. and i invited my friends. over and i was like oh [ __ ] i should go tell them i said hey by the way i have two friends coming over they're not robbing me you're like okay good i'm glad you let me know i'm like oh why were you gonna shoot them anyway so now i got a [ __ ] car problem again dude rats ate my wires and rats ate my wires and [ __ ] two flat tires and someone hit my other car and now i got [ __ ] i got many car problems but maybe it's because i have many cars oh god whatever dude my point is it's crazy out there in los angeles but what happened was now i'm at swingers. and this is what i wanted. to tell you about how crazy my friend. is i don't know what's up. with my friend maybe he's on the spectrum. i don't really know and i don't mean. to knock anybody on. the spectrum i actually think maybe my friend is on the spectrum. but he like i don't know he does. this thing where like we were. we were in the place. swingers and [ __ ] there's a dog in the restaurant. and it's on a leash. and i notice it because it's a dog. in a restaurant and i'm like okay. maybe it's like a [ __ ] either a seeing eye dog. and nobody's blind. there though so i'm like okay. it's an emotional support pet. but i'm like leave him at home. right there's food. i'm like isn't this unsanitary. how'd this person get this. [ __ ] dog in a diner have you ever seen a dog. in a diner i've never seen. a dog in a diner. i know i'm looking down. to my right as i'm paying and there's a dog. in a diner now what do. i not want to. do i don't want to. give this person any [ __ ] energy because they've got a dog and a diner and anyone with a dog in a diner what do they want they want one thing energy and that could be in the form of attention. it could be in the form. of anger it could be the form. of anything but they want looks they want. something they want energy so i don't [ __ ] give it to. him because it's all out. war when you got a dog. in the diner and i'm there. you want that attention you want. that energy well guess what troops. mobilize no i got those binders. on i'm not looking at you. if you've got a dog in an under but i notice. that the peripheral like a hippo. okay and then i notice more out. of my peripheral my friend. with his phone out taking a picture of the dong. he's taking a picture of it. this is exactly what they [ __ ] wanted you know i'm so annoyed. i'm just like oh great. in the meantime i don't. know this but somebody's literally trying to. break into my [ __ ] [ __ ] car i have no idea but that's beside the point so he's trying to. [ __ ] god damn take a picture of this. and i look at him. and i just see his [ __ ] smile and i hear it. you know it's one of those [ __ ] hearing. you can hear you know. how some people's faces you can just hear. if you're close enough like newscasters. theo vaughn's like that too but my buddy's. like that and he's taking a picture and i hear. his [ __ ] face just from being close to. it and out of the peripheral. in my [ __ ] i see the [ __ ] guy taking a picture and i go why are you taking a picture of this dog and he says i don't know and now i'm pissed off more because he doesn't even have a [ __ ] reason so he's just taking a picture of the dog so now he takes a picture of the dog i finish paying and i walk outside with him oh i forgot another part of the thing a guy this is why la's going [ __ ] to. hell in a hand basket. so as we're eating the food. okay a homeless guy walks into. the diner with [ __ ] all over him oh i forgot the best part. oh oopsie daisy the story was so banging. that i forgot the best. part as if it was the worst. part so this homeless guy. walks in with excrement on him. not like hey bro. you got [ __ ] on you and it's not [ __ ] like hey bro you have [ __ ] on you and it's excrement and guess where it is the worst possible place where chris his mouth nope his hands oh but that's not worse than i thought let me stop you right there it's worse to. have [ __ ] on your mouth if it's yours if it's someone else it's bad when it's on their hands cause they can touch you okay so hey guy i don't mean to. be rude to. you i feel bad that you're down. and out but you got [ __ ] on your hands so you've got to. get out of the establishment. that i'm in so the [ __ ] dude came over like the dude. who was the manager. he's like hey man. you just gotta go you gotta go. you know you gotta go and the guy was like yeah. but i need some money. and he was like yeah but you gotta go. and he's like can i just have a dollar. to somebody else in another. booth it's like you gotta go you got [ __ ] on your hands you gotta go you got [ __ ] on your hands and the guy just [ __ ] wafted it all up so i was like [ __ ] right the guy ends up leaving so then we pay and my buddy takes a picture with the dog sorry i'm doing an ad order like i'm quitting tarantino or something but i'm telling a story and this is how it goes right so as we're leaving i say to. him man what a weird. night and he says why. just because i took a picture of a dog. and as we're walking out i say nah. man cause of the guy. who had [ __ ] all over his hands not the people who had a dog at the diner and as i'm walking out there's a [ __ ] gay couple with a [ __ ] dog eating outside on the patio and they're right next to. me and the guy says to. me well yeah we're in la. and i say oh [ __ ] now i'm in this. predicament i wasn't talking about. this guy and also here's the thing. i don't care if the dog's outside. of the diner and you're on the patio. that's where it should be. but this guy now thinks that i'm bitching about him. being outside on the patio. with the dog at the diner and he says oh and i said no. no i'm actually it actually has nothing to. do with you what i'm saying. and he says okay. because i was gonna say well. that was extraordinarily sarcastic and i was like i know i get it. but it really wasn't and i say look. at that cutie because the dog. was cute and as i'm saying look. at that cutie my buddy. who i think might perhaps be on. the spectrum is taking another picture. of this goddamn dog so now. i'm fuming dude can. i just get out of this. goddamn diner without making a documentary. about dogs excuse me but am i a pa on a documentary. about dogs and diners or am i just chilling. with my weird friend that just happens. to take pictures of [ __ ] dogs and diners because either way i don't want to. be a part of it. whoopsie daisy i've either got this job. as a documentarian or i'm hanging out with this friend who's taking pictures. of dogs for no reason. so i begin to. walk away because not only do i want to. distance myself from my friend i don't even want to. be in this situation at all. so i'm like if you're going to. take a [ __ ] picture of this. dog after not learning your lesson. on the first one then dude. you're on your [ __ ] own so as i'm walking. away the guys are like oh wow and my buddy. of all he's taking the picture of the [ __ ] dog and he's trying to. get the dog's attention. and the guys are like sitting there like posing this poor gay. couple just sitting there just posing like what's this. [ __ ] weirdo dude doing my buddy trying to. get the dog attention he goes like this. and the dog loses his mind. i mean dude don't hey number one. hey let's make a list of things. to not do when you see a random. dog number one stab him number. two snap at him. because you don't know. what the dogs are doing this. dog goes and the gay. dude's like oh okay okay and my buddies. taking pictures they're all coming. out blurry like the dogs. in the [ __ ] ring like it saw the video and then and so then my buddy. just like a [ __ ] just walking over to. me and i'm like what the [ __ ] bro. what was all that and he was like yeah. the [ __ ] on his hands and i'm like i'm talking about the [ __ ] dogs now and we get in my car bloody guts. we don't see the [ __ ] splintered. this is the when it happened right. that somebody tried to. break in my car i mean. what a [ __ ] travesty this whole night so i get in the car. we're both sitting in the [ __ ] bloody guts. and i say to. him i say hey man. i gotta know sorry this is just something. for me just for me. my wellbeing you did your [ __ ] now let me just do mine. right it's like a conversation where you. let somebody talk you do the listening. now it's my turn okay. you got to do. all your [ __ ] by taking the pictures of the dogs and all your misunderstanding about the guy with the [ __ ] on his hands and now it's [ __ ] my turn okay we're in my car i'm in the driver's seat literally so i say why did you why did you take that picture of that dog in the inside and he says well no but i i thought it i because i thought it was cute. and i said no no no i get wanting. to see the dog. and i understand why you did. it in that way but why did you take the picture. and he said i thought it. was cute and i said no no no i thought the dog. was cute as well but why. did you take that picture. and he said i don't know. i guess i wanted to. have the picture and then i said why. and then he said i guess. i don't know i could look at it. whenever i want to. and i said you're never gonna. look at that photo again. and he started laughing. and he said i don't know. maybe i'll post it on instagram. and i said yeah and what are you. gonna say he said i'll probably put on my story and i'll i'll put like i don't know. swinger's diner [music] not worth it. [music] worth it population zero i mean. dude oh yeah you're gonna post a picture. of a dog cool man. well you got it you got that. picture and then we walked outside. and you took another picture of a dog. hey man why'd you do that. one and he said well cause i thought. the dog looked cute. and i said no no no we've already. been down this road why. and he said well i thought it. would be funny if i posted. a picture of a dog. and then i posted another picture. of a dog it would be like what's up. with all these dogs because this is lost. because it doesn't make sense. because that's what they do. in the show lost during commercial. break it'll go so now. we're doing it now because this situation. makes as much sense as the show. lost when my friend takes one picture of a dog. but one my friend takes. two pictures of two dogs. i just do don't understand. this like also you're just you're just like in your 40s. uh you know what i mean. who you [ __ ] steve irwin pick a brand. you know pick a lane. oh now you're a guy who takes pictures. of dogs at a diner for [ __ ] sake i i mean i like a [ __ ] it's like dude i deal with that craziness because he's my friend and i love him he's one of my best friends in the world and i love him taking pictures of dogs or not but that's a downass [ __ ] and i know his craziness but my point is there's new people you meet and those people are [ __ ] absolutely bonkers crazy those people maybe are the people that bring the dogs in the diner or even worse maybe they're the person who walks into. a diner with [ __ ] all over his hands you don't know people but you know your friends so stay tight with your friends. and try not to. meet too many people and definitely don't listen. to anybody there's always a moral right. there's always a moral and the moral is you know. don't watch super pumped i do love. this podcast and uh let's watch this. rick ross video i mean. is this guy [ __ ] a fan of the podcast. or what dude this guy's an insane. [ __ ] person while i'm watching this one dude one fire will you look up the [ __ ] expensive sweat one because he did that one too i don't even know if you heard about it so rick ross bringing down a cow here this is rick ross doing it getting on a camel so [ __ ] immediate [ __ ] oh cincy the end of it dude dude someone screenshot that face so worried half. on it's a [ __ ] [ __ ] oh face at the end dude cincy you know what the thing is about rappers honestly they're like batman. they can't do [ __ ] that might leave them cincy. right like imagine batman was. a real person don't have people. with [ __ ] iphones film you getting on a camel you're gonna look so [ __ ] unless you do it all the time you gotta remain at the utmost most hardcore [ __ ] of all time you can't all you can't be rapping about rims hoes and money and how you kill people and how you're about and then all of a sudden you want to.
