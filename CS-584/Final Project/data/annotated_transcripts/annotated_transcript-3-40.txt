deal with a copyright issue. if you keep singing it. gonna get sued gnn okay. hey guys duck dynasty me. again want to. let yall know not remember me. from last week even though. i'm you know you guys. are busy and doing all kinds of stuff. remember uh y'all were really nice to. me and you said that. i was sweet and uh you listened to. me and i just thought that was something. else i mean that was just pretty neat. um my son is home i followed your advice. uh he got to. meet his namesake and my mother. and it was awesome. uh there was no specialty. needed but hey chris. i want to. let you know you're right. i do not shower very. much you were your first. judgment baz zinga was so right. in uh so i want to. ask you as a man. that looks like this that is is. rough looking how do i also look clean and uh thank you guys love. you guys so much i love you. know what i mean i love that. well dude i got to. tell you man like i i'm with you. he looks clean to. me maybe he got cleaned up. for the [ __ ] video you but dude like everyone one of the top. things about me is like oh he looks like he doesn't shower. bro i shower every single day. they say about you you're like the cleanest person. i know i know i'm very very clean. yeah to the point. that it's like a kind of annoying. yeah um but and and people think like because i guess. i have a beard and a that's it's just like when people have a beard. they're like you don't shower. like that that's a strange. thing the thing about that. is that beard looks it's not. trimmed at all it's very un. lookoo it's too long to. be in the world well yeah. it's too long to. be looking clean unless you trim. you got to trim. it yeah so i don't think really you can do. anything unless you trim your beard. i mean to look. clean if you were dressing a tux. to the nines you'd still look dirty. because it's not trimmed. that is signifies not taking care of yourself. right to yes it does. but it shouldn't but it does. it shouldn't and times may. be changing but buddy we ain't. there yet yeah yeah right. we're just not there yet. as a society we live in a society you know what i mean. yeah yeah we do um so well he looks like he. does not but right. he actually does not he looks like he yeah. he knows knows more animals than humans. but um yeah man i i i don't know if there's a way. to do it unless you trim. a little bit your beard. and your mustache if you have here's the thing. if you have the mustaches that go and curl. up back into your. teeth forget it you're dirty. you could wash three times a day. yeah that's no one wants to. even see that he doesn't have. that if you're tasting. follicle i mean i don't that's disgusting. even say i just i don't want. oh look a dog lost. your mind um un. acid just tripped so hard. there's a dog over. there past the camera so um what. you did is what a guy. who does the best. man speech should not do because the audience. wasn't involved it was but we were right. yeah we were it was an inside. joke then i had to. explain it right. okay but inside joke. it just appeared in front an inside. thing okay okay well now you're pissing me. off though so it's all good. fine but that's fine. right because you're made a mistake. okay uh but he doesn't to. me honestly it doesn't look dirty it. looked like his beard. was specifically shampooed oh well to. me oh do you wash your how do you wash. your thing my face no. your beard with i just wash it. with my face soap like that. yeah me too i never do. have you ever tried to. shampoo it no tried to. do it once somebody told me. how to do it. to do it once. did it broke out completely. but it was i had a beard. oh sucks yeah no you shouldn't be. doing that unless you have a beard. like that but it's like hair. all right cool so basically trim. your beard and that's the only way. you'll look clean you. may be clean but you also aren't clean cuz you don't sher. that much so there you go. you admitted it i was right. i'm a detective okay hey matt. and chris my name is nick. and i live in fort wayne. indiana for some reason. uh still waiting on that. hbo max set to. roll up into town uh to. get that mixed race couple. uh show going um anyway uh so this. is kind of a question. for chris but matt i would love. it if you chimed. in too uh chris i have a 2yearold probably about calvin's. age a little bit younger. but um anyway we're you know you. hear the ageold thing of the terrible. twos you know oh you know. my kid blah blah. blah turns into. some sort of like demon when they're too. um we have never really believe that. my wife and i have never really. believed that but we're starting. to see kind of this. terrible two streak i guess. come about in our. daughter and uh you know it's like the the saying no all the time. just being a contrarian to. be a contrar like we get twoyear. olds are like scientists that. are always experimenting with different. things just to. see what kind of reactions you can. get so but it's reaching a point. where like she'll say no. and it's like noy kind of like testing. you you know what i'm saying. so chris my question is how do you handle. this sort of stage with calvin. it sounds like on congratulations. and on this podcast. that you do have kind of the contrarian. behaviors you have to. deal with uh so how do you go about that. matt i would again i would love to. hear your input as well. sorry i went way. too long i appreciate you guys. more than i can ever. express i a true baby. for life peace nice just real. quick i think give her up. for adoption that's my my your it's kind of everything. that it's actually super weird that. that's part of the developmental. process like dude just when they get to. around two or whatever. actually my pediatrician said it's usually uh it. usually starts cuz the first year. is to one the second. year is to. two so she's like it's the second year. usually so it starts. before two oh that's what she said. with calvin it didn't really start. till a little later. but um but um yeah they do it. like the chinese years you. know is that what they do. i don't know me. neither but um so uh yeah. calvin says no like he says no. like about everything now yeah he said no the other day. i said you know. what i really like your hair. today and he said no. you don't and like a like a vietnamese like like that. yeah and he and and he wasn't even. looking at me so. he's just like they just do. that [ __ ] because they know oh i don't have to. do [ __ ] i have free will though [ __ ] but what's interesting is that they don't cuz everyone does it at that phase in their life it's like they don't have free will they need to. say no to. everything the matrix you know what i'm saying. yeah it's just like it's automatic with cal. i've noticed it for sure. he's just like it's like this. beyond an impulse it's like he has to. do it you think you know. you think you got the choice. to do it but it was your destiny to. say no yeah you saying no is so [ __ ] typical and obvious. you being a real rebel you'd say yes to. everything yeah right wow. i'm going to tell him. that when he understands it. when he's older dude. so yeah really he's you're just it's part. of it's part of it it's the this. was designed if you were a real rebel you would say yes to. everything i want you to. do y that's i'm start. telling the adults and everything. actually also you just did it. you just are saying no mhm basically i have that's me. that did that cuz i i i spurted you made. him i made you half of you. half of kristen yeah right. yeah so i made you so you're saying no because i designed that. wow wow so say that to. your daughter i think he's got a daughter say. that to your daughter worst. dad ever imagine designed you i designed. you to say no but calvin does. this thing too where he stops cuz that's what peppa. pig does and he loves peppa. pig and he goes like this. no i don't and it's really. cute and it's hard. not to smile cuz when he says no. it's so cute and then you kind of smile. but you kind of got to. like turn your head that seems like trouble. yeah you don't want to. let them know it's enjoyable when they say no. right mhm mhm but do you let them. know it's enjoyable no i don't go i don't i i you try not to. i go oh yeah like that. so i'm like kind of laughing. but it's like okay here we go. dud turn of events so yeah. so that's really what you got to. do also well i actually didn't give any advice. but the advice is what you can. do is the art of diversion. right cuz like kids. are so oh i'm doing one. thing then i'm doing another thing. oh more colors oh a cartoons on construction paper right. or a truck drove by if they say no hey like

i did do why no what i do. i did no you go why. oh oh yeah it's completely. stone face so i go oh maybe he thinks i am ugly. my intention of saying why. though was actually because i looked at you. and thought i don't see that. so why do you think that but i could have expressed. that more i didn't and i don't have any regrets about. it but maybe i should have done. that well um you know. when you put on an outfit sometimes and you're like oh [ __ ] this outfit's banging right. yeah yeah and then like a week. later or two weeks later you put on the same outfit. and you're like wow it. just doesn't feel right oh do you do. that uh i don't not really maybe last time. i wore this outfit i felt. [ __ ] fly as [ __ ] now i'm wearing this outfit i don't feel good no i think you look good thanks all right. next one hey chris hey matt. my name is maya and i'm from tono canada. i'm a huge fan of both. of you i could go on and on about. it but i know i don't have that. much time no go ahead. go ahead so i just wanted to. ask you about a friendship. issue a couple of months. ago back in april i guess i broke off. a friendship with somebody who i've had been. best friends with for 18 years. essentially to sum. it up she started dating. this guy about a year or so back. and um i got red flags. pretty much from the getgo. she before she met him was super enthusiastic. love life really passionate and it's kind of like a social butterfly. and i you know that's what i loved. about her after she met. him i think he really dug. at her confidence and she completely. lost all selfesteem there. were just so many things going. downhill for her and he was just a really narcissistic selfish. person who was just all about himself. i we have a judge free. friendship um or so i thought so i approached. her about it and just gave her my opinion. as it turns out it. wasn't appreciated and she basically said that. i my opinion was unwanted. and uncalled for and pretty much. i should be ashamed. for saying what i said and that i'm really judgmental damn. she went on to. say some really hurtful things and ultimately i caught. her off not even two. seconds later i have a problem i guess it's easy. for me to cut people. off but what she said. just really hurt. my feelings wow so i guess. i'm wondering two things number. one was it none of my business. and should i have just stayed out. of it was i out. of place and number two did i jump. the gun on ending our. friendship um we're gonna make the right. choice anyways thanks guys dude. i think okay first of all she owes. you an apology yeah i also think just real quick. i think that it's indicative of how she feels about. it as as well that she had that. reaction dude to. get that crazy and that defensive. about something like that. that means she probably either agrees. with you or has had feelings. along those lines as well. but doesn't want to. face but i also think though dude. that's kind of you cut it. off immediately like i don't know what she said. she might have said something. terrible if you i mean who knows. i mean cutting it off. immediately is kind of like a huh. in your like she's asking did i jump. the gun yeah and you're say i don't know the whole relationship. but like it sounds like maybe you did. i don't know what she said. i mean maybe she maybe like if your dad. died of cancer and she's like i'm glad. your dad died [ __ ] him he deserved it. right that's a different story right. she's saying that the the friend. threw things back at her about her that she had never said before. and they were really mean. that's the well that's why. i say she owes you. apology she her apology but here's the [ __ ] issue dude the main thing is dude just i i don't think you're judgmental but like i think that you when it comes to. like love and who people are dating. you just got to. [ __ ] stay out of it yeah you know like we get this these kinds of questions a lot should i tell my [ __ ] friend who's got it's just i think you just kind of got to. let them do their thing. and figure it out themselves. cuz they either will or they won't and dude. love is they say love is blind. for a [ __ ] reason dude yeah you're not going to. you're not going to. change their mind you're not going. to change their mind. that drug love is too. too too intoxicating here's the other thing. though dude a chick i bet this. i bet now this is me. supposing but i bet. this girl was like i need to. talk to you can we meet for. coffee and made a whole [ __ ] thing about it. which made it way worse this. kind of thing is way. better to d just drop little [ __ ] side bombs on like dudes do test it out. also test it out see how defensive she. is but what's done. is done right right. what's done is done but i'm just saying. for the future and if this other girl apologizes and you decide to. recing friendship which it's been 18. years of friendship dude drop. these side bombs on [ __ ] like dudes do because chicks are let's me let's see oh hey i made you a card and this is the thing i want to. talk to you about and over here. and they got a laser pointer. and now the other chick. is like well i'm glad your died. dad died of cancer right. right because it's a whole thing. but if you're a dude. right and you're just dudes are like yeah because you're girl. you know your girl does that. [ __ ] it's [ __ ] up and d like what you talking about it's like i'm just saying she does it but who gives a [ __ ] and then they're at they're doing it literally at the club and they got botles and then you know that the dude disapproves of the [ __ ] girl and that's a side bomb because it seek it seeps inside of your your buddy and he kind of gets the idea and that's where the idea grows but when you come [ __ ] blind. in like that we got to. not i guess you're not blindid if you're setting it. up but it sounds like she made a whole thing. about it sounds like she made a whole thing. about it but it's a bad. it's a bad move it's about we don't. know what the friend said but it could have been [ __ ] horrible and this woman who's calling in might have had no [ __ ] choice of course yeah it could have been yeah but i'm just saying a lot of it sounds a little bit like it could have been handled differently. by both of you and it sounds like it. sounds like uh yeah that's that's all. i got to say yeah. i mean i i don't b based on. the fact that i don't know. what she said to. you maybe you jumped the gun. maybe you didn't only you can know. really uh because you know. the what she actually said um as far as the other thing. it's hard to. be friends with someone to. continue to. be friends with someone when you slowly. see them disappear from their. old self disappear and then become a new self sort of shaped. by their partner who you already don't like and think is a bad influence so i get why you would back off from that friendship uh anyway but i don't think that uh this is never going to. work if you just tell them. that i mean i i agree. with you maybe it was gone. maybe it was going away. anyway and this was like a last stage effort. to get her to. see the light you know. and also people always talk about like relationships. ending how it failed. like dude 18 years. of friendship that's a successful. relationship sucessful relationship um uh all right. cool let's do the next. one what is up. lads if i made in on a show absolutely incredible. chis been a massive fan. since the vine days since uh first carolines on broadway. ages ago uh matt you're the [ __ ] man. both of you thank you. for the laughes and uh keep it going. um my question is around. uh trust making new friends. uh i consider myself a misanthropic. humanist uh someone who loves humanity. but struggles with uh the individual. you know i [ __ ] hate people um cuz you really can't trust them especially meeting people later. and uh you could just be making up. absolute [ __ ] like that um i have trouble. trusting new people i need to. know that they are good individuals. that they're good people how do you guys. go about getting a good sense. of character finding

incredible. british chr has been a massive. fan since the vine days since uh i first saw you on carolines on broadway. ages ago uh matt you're the [ __ ] man. you're the [ __ ] man both of you thank you for the laughs and uh thank you okay now watch our question. is around uh trust making new friends. uh i consider myself a misanthropic. humanist someone who loves humanity but struggles. with uh the individual you. know i [ __ ] hate people um you really can't trust them. especially meeting people later on. in your life and uh you could just be making up. absolute [ __ ] like that um i have trouble. trusting new people i need to. know that they are good individuals. that they're good people how do you guys. go about getting a good sense. of character what finding the people. that you can trust later. on in life making those new friends. friends um and knowing that you're surrounding yourself with new good. um kindhearted people what love y. too it did change. bro dude is this a trick. he's talking about trust and he's [ __ ] trying to. lie to. us about where he's [ __ ] from bro. this is crazy dude. it really did i know. chris mat big fan massive fan. i will tell you this. much it's mtal has absolutely mental. anybody that ever says you're not. funny i say bullocks. i say bullocks my butler was tell me. this the other day. i got so upset. i threw down my t trumpets anyway. is it really hard. to trust people or dude. so weird that's one of the weirdest [ __ ] things. good catch man. that's so [ __ ] weird man. what the [ __ ] what the [ __ ] dude get out of here. bro [ __ ] get out of here. dude before i realized it. this is what i was going. to say is bro. it's you're living exhausting it's exhausting. to do that just [ __ ] meet people and just see what up. it's exhausting dude you you oh am. i going to trust. this person am i going. to [ __ ] know i have no idea they don't even know where you're from bro. you changed the way. you talk yeah yeah yeah no one. should trust you yeah look in the mirror. man you're like valk are from. the saint in one video dude. right yeah exactly just changing. identities but yeah dude uh it's exhausting. it's [ __ ] exhausting to. live like tupac be like trust. nobody who knows what the [ __ ] and he ended. up dead yeah i mean dude. it's so just people are shitty. people are not shitty like the same. person can be shitty uh and not shitty. about just about different. things it's too you're making. it seem too black and white. like people aren't exactly dishonest. but just because they're not forthcoming. and super honest about every single thing. doesn't mean they're like you can't. trust them yeah people are weird. but the other thing is people generally. are trustworthy because they deep. down know the world can't. work if everyone's [ __ ] lying all the time wow the world cannot work and people know that and so they generally are trustworthy because they want you to. be trustworthy as well. they want the people around. them they want to. be able to. trust other people and i don't know if you've noticed i mean. i think you've [ __ ] noticed because you're obviously a weird person. and not exactly worth warranting. trust because you don't have the same. [ __ ] accent from one word to. to the next but the people that tell the most lies. are the most [ __ ] crazy about being lied. to or the possibility about being lied. to about trusting other people. [ __ ] that don't trust people are liars. not obviously all of them. but that is like a real thing. in the world a yeah. people that are up to. the worst [ __ ] assume other people are up to. the worst [ __ ] it's just like the most innocent people are super [ __ ] trustworthy because that's generally how it [ __ ] goes oh yeah because they feel like well why wouldn't they be like me yeah they're just like well there's no nobody's a piece of [ __ ] that's is why like i think that everybody's got a big dick because i'm like oh that's actually not at all what i'm talking about but that's a version people think you're saying people think that people are trustworthy because you're trustworthy or or whatever yeah and i'm saying that's why that that is 100% why i always think everyone has a huge monster you know what i'm saying okay but anyway i think my point is well tak but i do want to. get back to this [ __ ] guy who who has done one of the weirdest things i've ever anybody do he started out massive. man like [ __ ] liam gallagher and then he ended up like [ __ ] eric irvine. down the block grown up you know wow yeah yeah yeah and i it's crazy. bro but i have a feeling. he has honestly his penis. if he were to. lay it on the table. it would go across the table. and then hit the floor. on the other end so uncomfortable. just so not so not good. for living for sex for anything. all right cool let's do it. what's up boys is. first off your singing voices. are impeccable both of you so sexy. second off chris i'll be seeing you in lakeland. florida baby what is

also like to. ask her out i might might be potentially interested. and asking her out she's walking. it back but the problem. is she oh boy. is at a desk around. a ton of other people. with other desks and there's not much. of a partition between them. either oh no so it doesn't usually feel. appropriate to just go. over and strike up a conversation. with someone i'm not i'm not in her. department she's at the other end. of the building wow how would you guys approach. that and then also like is it. even appropriate you know to. to ask somebody out. at work um how do you go about. that without causing. an hr issue obviously don't be a creep. right um i don't think i have that problem. but i think it's just like a matter. of like how do you even go. about that have you guys. ever done that in the past. asked somebody out that you work. with um and also why does chris look. like this when he's in public. that's good i do who anyway. thanks guys but also in private. yeah

private. um i think it's not appropriate. it's not appropriate but also if you're going. to do it don't do it. at work you got to. do it off yeah. even if it's just right outside the office. right outside oh yeah do you you know. what do you are you. in the different cuz i think you're in a different. department okay but do you fancy. going to dinner sometime. well that was the other thing. i
