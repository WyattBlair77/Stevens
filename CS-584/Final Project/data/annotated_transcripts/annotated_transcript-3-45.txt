was nothing you could do. except scream and cry. oh that was me interesting. because i was about to. correct you and say actually i had. a dream where i was apart. on both sides and different. taking turns on reenacting genocides. so i would be both the killing. party and the killed party. and people would reenact them. but we realized each time. i knew that there were real bullets. in the guns like it. was like a civil war reenactment. but these were like not real. genocides in the past like future. genocides that hadn't actually happened and we had to. like act them out and then we would realize as as we were acting. them out they were really killing. us oh god and then it would reset. and then i would be the killer. and then it would reset. again and that would be the the one. we get and each time. oops each time. i would be surprised at tom cruise. movie dude it's called the killing. party called genocide future genocide. so it's all good that. we have super [ __ ] up bro dude mine was [ __ ] up man i was just like no crying. and somebody was just watching me. cry while one of my friends. chose to burn alive. in a [ __ ] house but they wanted to. do it yeah i know but dude.

can't wait to. tell you but i'm not gonna tell you until we start. the [ __ ] podcast so you don't know the story no and you keep talking about how crazy it is okay it's the craziest thing. that's ever happened to. me all right when i fell down. an elevator shaft what yeah what did. that happen uh butthead in high school. was in high school. chris uh yes but you weren't. the person who fell down. okay great wow so um so it wasn't you so anyway. so uh this story is the number one. craziest thing that's ever happened. by far okay okay so um since we just found out. that the elevator thing happened to. chris this is very viable. and i keep waiting for the [ __ ] cops to. call me you know. what i mean okay. so um i'm flying alone. and you know me. how like nervous am i to. fly zero right exactly zero percent. nervous i fly a lot. i never get nervous i'm just like whatever. we take off i [ __ ] fall asleep before and i don't even notice. we took off for whatever. reason i get i get there. to flight [ __ ] early because they're like get the early get they're really good early because customs takes so long custom takes me 12 minutes. it never takes long. dude and there's like one every 20. times but the fest people were like warning me warning. me right right so i'm like okay. i guess i gotta [ __ ] anyway i get there in like i'm like either three hours early wow. and i'm just waiting waiting [ __ ] waiting waiting waiting waiting so dad and finally we get on the plane. then we're waiting on the plane. yeah and the time's going going on i got a buddy. picking me up on the other end. i'm like i don't know i'm just getting like antsy. and i'm just realizing the limited. space around me i'm in an exit. row but it's not enough. space okay and uh i'm just like i'm like my knees. tapping and i'm noticing myself getting more and more anxious wow. and i'm just like ugh all. right at least if we just take off it'll. be uh you'll be on your way. exactly so five minutes 10. minutes 20 minutes pass. finally we take off. like 30 40 minutes after we we're supposed. to we're in the air. and i'm good yeah i fall asleep. i wake up [music] and i'm like oh [ __ ] yeah i bet we're almost we're almost back. in l.a i look at the flight. map thing okay and it's and it's three hours. and 11 minutes left. okay so we're not even close. well you fell asleep for [ __ ] four. hours two hours okay two and a half. hours right so a little a little less than halfway. how far away okay. so i he's laughing. i'm looking at 311 okay. and we've talked a little about a little bit. about anxiety attacks that we've had yeah. and the first one i ever had i overheard this. couple talking about jerry o'connell and then i started thinking about jerry o'connell. and how weird it is that he's so famous. and then my mind my mind just spun. out and then 90 seconds later i'm like i can't see my heart's beating yeah joseph was a good man. and gonna give me one and uh i [ __ ] that's so that's the context. that's my first anxiety attack. i've had like two or three total. okay but they're always in restaurants. or weirdly lowly lit. places like one time i had one in the stadium at night. okay it's the way the light. affects me and sometimes. the way my mind spins. out on spools okay in an unforeseen way. right okay so 311 but you don't pass. out no i don't know okay okay okay so it's 3 11 and i'm thinking about uh three it's got three hours and 11 minutes. that sucks i'm starting. to realize this tight space. again everybody's asleep it's like a night flight. oh and then i think about oh yeah. there's that band 311 and then i think about oh i remember when that. band 311 was popular everybody. said it was a white. supremacist band because three eleven. three k is kkk. right right and then i'm thinking about the kkk. and then i'm just like whoops. you know my brain. sure is now falling out. of my skull and i'm just like [ __ ] ah. and i got like a millions of [ __ ] thoughts. flying through my head all uncontained and unthought. through okay and then i'm like well at least a lot. of time just passed and i look at the flight. map and there's three hours and 11. minutes left okay so like i'm losing my perception. of [ __ ] time yeah and i'm just like but inside right. right i'm not freaking out. on the outside i'm freaking out. on the inside because i'm a good. person i don't want to. scare these people on the plane. yeah so i i'm actually like uh oh this. is gonna be an anxiety. [ __ ] and usually i have like you know whatever [ __ ] xanax something around yeah somebody with something even though i don't usually have that sure so i'm like somebody on the plane has to. have one maybe even if i ask the fighter. yeah yeah sorry so i go to. the back and i tell this. flight attendant look okay. uh uh i'm i'm really sorry. i'm not gonna cause a scene. i don't want to. scare you or anybody else but like i'm on. the i know myself i've had a couple of these before. in my life i'm on the precipice. of having an anxiety attack. and and uh uh i don't know what to. do i don't have any medication. with me yeah okay. okay so she's really really nice okay. and she says okay well let me see what. i can do and it seems like she's gonna [ __ ] figure something out right. yeah so she goes to. the front to. the head of the flight crew. and and her and and one of the head. of the flight crew comes back. two women now okay okay they both. come back and she's talking to. me about what she can. do is there anything. and she's like well you know. maybe if you just talk to. me and i'm like thanks. right like i know what i [ __ ] need right you know so sh so she's like okay okay you're not you're not telling her. what you might need i am. i'm like it would really. help me if somebody had some kind of valium. or xanax or anything like that. you know they can't do that. though right okay so uh so she's like okay. okay and she's coming up. with suggestions super nice right. suck but she's being so nice. yeah she's clearly never had anxiety. right she's like what if we do a play right. and i'm just she's like you can pace. around here in the galley. and i'm like i don't right. give a [ __ ] but thanks right you know what i mean right but i'm like being nice but like short you know i'm just like thanks. but you know i actually know what this. is you know right. right and uh and i know you yeah and so i'm like okay. she's like well what we could. do if you think it's worth. it we could call see if there's a doctor on the plane. see if he can talk to. you right here she can talk. to you okay and i'm like normally. you know me i would never do. that right yeah yeah. like i'm like my heart's like about to. pop out of my chest. right so i'm like you're really going. through it yeah dude. and so i'm like i'm like okay. okay okay and and they're like okay. great so nice okay. wow so they call for a [ __ ] doctor this guy comes to. the back of the plane. and he's like what's going on. you know and everybody's got a mask. on except me. and they're like it's okay. you don't need a mask. on i think it might have contributed. but i wasn't being like a [ __ ] shitty. maggot guy like i don't wear this [ __ ] i was just like i think this might have contributed to. my anxiety because i'm feeling like contained. which sucks and um so the doctors all just as [ __ ] cool. just as great and they're like and he's like so it turns. out he's a neurosurgeon at cedars okay so he's like my son has this exact same. thing happens all the time you guys. have a first aid kit right. they're like yes and he's like you guys have valium and xanax. and adivan in there right. and and she's like yes and i'm like yes. right why didn't you say. that dude well because she needs. a doctor clearance right exactly so he's like get it. out and he even now he's like just give it to. him yeah he's got to. sign all these papers he's being so [ __ ] great. right right my absolute hero. cool okay cool so he [ __ ] he hooks me up. and he's like he'll need two but give him. one and if it doesn't if he's not feeling a lot. better in 20 minutes give him. the next one right. okay i take one feel a little bit. better okay good yeah good doing his job. 20 minutes later i'm like i'm still like my heart's still racing it'll. be better i've taken this. drug many times right i've been prescribed. it and uh by doctors kind of yes exactly. and and he's like okay. well she comes by and she's like would the head of the flight. team would you like that. other one i can see. you seem a little bit. still maybe nervous yeah and i was like that. would be amazing thank you. so much he brings me another one. okay now i'm like okay well the edge. is gonna go now here's where the story turns. oh my god the woman in the row. in front of me. turns around and says hi. so nice hi i heard you. were having an anxiety. attack i get them all. the time would you like some of my medicine. she doesn't know at all that. i've gotten medicine from the flight people already. okay which is already a lot. it's not like i'm going to. go [ __ ] passing out or right. right but it's a big. dose two milligrams of outofband is. a lot that's yeah okay. um so but me being me and not you yeah. i immediately say yes before she can. even stop asking finish asking the question. wow she gives me. a pill that i've never seen. before you already had the second one. i know right before this. right before it she so you should have. waited for it to say. oh yeah okay oh yeah all right. so i should have waited. i shouldn't even have taken it. right so she hands me. the pill and in one. motion her hand comes out. my hand goes out gets it. and just [ __ ] takes the pill. right you ask what it. was no dude i just it. was just so stupid all. right okay okay so uh i take it. mom and dad sorry. i know you're listening this you're so [ __ ] freaking out. right now that's crazy. i won't do it. again i promise uh next thing. i know dude i'm coming to. standing above different people. on the plane in the middle. of conversations and all of them. are looking at me. like this and only i can see they're only their eyes. they're all like this and they're they're scared. we're really confused i'm in the aisle. standing over them and every time. i come to i realize i'm scaring. this person i don't know how i got here i don't. know what i'm saying okay i don't know what i'm saying. okay okay hold on hold. on okay they're where are they they're just they're in. their standards being good people regular good calm collected good. citizens okay okay and i'm these are passengers passengers okay and i'm standing over. them okay looking down at them. probably really scary. without a mask on. right saying things that i don't even know what they are. because i don't know what i'm doing. because i mean there yeah yeah okay. so i wake up when i'm realizing. i'm upsetting someone only what this happens. at least four times one time. dude two of them. i remember distinctly okay. one time a guy is pushing. me off of him and i come too because he's physically. pushing me and i'm like like i'm being pushed. by a guy who i don't know who it is and i don't know what i'm talking. to him about and but then when i come to. i'm just me again. so i'm like dude i'm so i'm so sorry. i have no [ __ ] idea what i'm doing. i don't even know what i said. to you i don't know what i said. you whatever i [ __ ] said what i don't know. what it was and i'm sorry. okay the next one. that i remember i'm standing above. this poor middleaged woman i'm sure. a very nice sweet. person she looks [ __ ] terrified and all i know is that i come to. wake up let's say saying remember that. you you don't remember that. okay you don't remember that. and she's just like like so scared. you know what i mean. and i feel so bad because i'm the one. scariest person and i don't even know how i did. it right right okay so then finally i'm back. in my [ __ ] seat and the guy next to. me actually i mean everyone on this. plane was so nice the guy. next to me was so nice. i guess i gave him uh my my email. address at some point right. oh my god okay so he emails. me just to. see how i'm doing like the next. day oh okay okay so and you get off. the plane everything's okay. yeah dude i find a guy. picking me up the next day. he was like you were [ __ ] up what the

before we get into. it we were gonna do this. but uh i got um dates coming. up i will be in grand prairie texas. dallas uh august 26th wichita. kansas august 27th atlanta. georgia september 9th on washington d.c september. 10th stockton and oakland i have a bunch. of dates go to. chrislea dot com cheyenne wyoming. denver colorado boston massachusetts albany i have. a bunch of dates go check it. out uh chrisleya dot com get get your tickets. it's uh you know they're selling. so uh thanks uh all right. let's do it yeah let's see. who it is it's that's the the the dead. guy he's survived please jake man. that machine says probably uh the first thing. you're going to say and this. first thing most girls say is like like good hygiene. no uh i mean okay. i think died to. add to one. of the problems of i mean. this guy is wait hold. on stop it he's always dying he stopped in the middle. he started in the middle of of the video. mmhmm play it again. from the beginning again. it was so low if that was the lower his eyes. recovered just a pair please. jake man the guy. from that machine says probably uh the first thing. you're going to say and this. first thing most girls say like you like good hygiene. i mean no died. that thing died this. guy dies you know what happens. he goes back into. he goes back in time. and and he experiences a whole. year and then comes back. like or you know. what i mean like goes to. the future experiences a. whole year yeah and then fixes the world. and then comes back that's what happens. yes like we would all died. with an asteroid would have hit us. and killed us but he saved. our lives right there go back. go back and see how he saved. our lives what right here watch when he saved. planet earth like good hygiene saved. the planet saved humanity right. there one of the problems. of why i had to. ask for advice is because i'm sure. you couldn't see that answer. for that um should we just go for taller. women or i mean you look. shorter than your wife or is it. matt are you are you. taller than yours what i. don't know if that's the issue. i look shorter than my wife. yeah you look shorter. than kristin hopefully she's not. my hygiene i know that. for a fact but i don't know what should i go. to bars i wouldn't i don't. like bars i don't really like drinking. so if you made it let me know. saved humanity three times we would have been extinct all right. all right so it turns. out that he's short okay okay that's it. first of all how short. second of all i don't look. shorter than kristen i don't know. dude this guy's got a couple. things going on but dude. you're [ __ ] handsome and you're so confident. you fall asleep in the middle. of questions you're cool. you're like matt you fall. asleep and wake up and then you're standing above. somebody's singing pearl jam dude. um you and him are basically marvel avengers. you know right right the worst. the two worst ones well he's saving. the world and you're just kind of singing. singing karaoke to. people on planes um yeah. don't do i go to. bars is what he's saying. dude i always think that meeting if you're gonna try. to meet a significant. other going to bars is. the worst thing yeah like you do you the people. who are at bars are not looking. to i mean pretty much. they might be but no no. but but not but you're at a bar. dude you go there. to get drunk you know. what i mean i mean. i yeah i agree yeah. so it's like you're looking for the people. who are trying to. do something to. something reckless do you. know what i'm saying i mean. i think i think people are speaking. trying to [ __ ] if he's just trying to [ __ ] i guess go to a bar but i think he's trying to find a girlfriend right that's what guys go to. bars for women don't go to. bars to [ __ ] they don't. maybe not generally speaking as much but you know they go to. hang out with the girls. have a night out and then they come home. and do a ouija board or some [ __ ] i'm just trying to. say he seems like he's looking for a relationship. and don't go to. a [ __ ] bar for that just like be a guy in the world who is as confident as you are you're [ __ ] so confident you're falling asleep in the middle of questions just even though you're short and obviously it doesn't matter you're sure you [ __ ] have confidence that's all that matters dude and i don't mean like boastful [ __ ] assholery just like being a person on earth who's comfortable with who you are that's all and you clearly are you're falling asleep in the middle of between words i'm saying i'm saying it so much yeah he he but also be maybe be more engaged sit up sit there talking to. people you know talk. a little faster don't. maybe don't fall asleep in the middle. of the sentence yeah. i mean this guy like this. is this guy yeah man. i'm just thinking you know. nice meeting you at this. bar you know maybe we just hang out. [laughter] maybe we hang out sorry. i was tr so what had. happened was in 40. years she's just walking away already in 40. years humanity is at a standstill. i had to go fix. uh basically the all the sperm. cap scientifically i had to. go fix the sperm count. in men because it was dying. and it was at the crux. of the situation where we was all. gonna be extinct anyway what are you getting. my friends what's that i'm going. to go join my friends. [laughter] thank you i mean. yeah the [ __ ] guy's just he's sitting right. it's right in front of him. dude you're a confident guy be be that and talk. to women and don't be a creep. that's so simple just those those things. all right you're good all. right and yeah if he's asking about hygiene. and be clean too. yeah be clean but no but a little bit of beard. is good though yeah girls. say that

different. teams we're on the same. team we want the same. goal but right now you're [ __ ] you're jumping when we should be hopping right yeah this is a red flag dude these flags be burgundy as [ __ ] man wow it's that time of the month for these flags dude why's uh these flags are [ __ ] need a tampon right right up soaking next to. him dude wow are you kidding. me man just didn't let the metaphor. sit there i had to. explain it in bloody. detail like i'm saying the flag. would be inside of these flags. are inside between le you. know of the women and it's that. time of the month okay okay so i don't think that's a very good. sounding relationship though too. to robot to further to. further my advice i don't think that's a very good. sounding relationship i don't think that's a very good. sounding relationship am i right. it sounds bad yeah and i could tell by the kind of guy. you are and the face you have the kind of relationships. that you get into. and i know what's going on. bro okay why don't you tell him. no because honestly that's for me. and him to be on that. wavelength and understand it you. know what's going on bro. you know what to. do okay you're being a little bit. of a [ __ ] guy that's like what do i do but you know what to. do and that's why she liked. you in the first place. and that's what works for. the relationship or get to. step in and that's that dude. okay all right there we have it. next one okay so much headroom. hey guys chris i watched you play. now i know we just said guys. with beards don't necessarily have bad. hygiene this is not an example. of that we don't know. that though maybe he showers. every day let's just look at the surroundings. we look and judge everything we're judging we are. judging you that's what we do. best guys i don't judge you. right we'll go here we go. too much also matt you're hilarious. and thank you huge fan. hey i mean i'm here but guys guess. what what's up my baby. gets to come home soon. three months in the hospital. oh no my wife is still up. there hour and a half. away driving back and forth oh yeah and he finally gets to. come home oh so pumped. that's awesome yes dude wow. um but i want to. surprise my mom and dad. he's named after my dad okay clinton so we call him. little clint cute what's the best way to. surprise my mom and dad. because i they don't know he's coming. home soon they know he's coming home. someday right but what's the best way to. surprise him guys i love. y'all i'm super anxious i have. filmed this 40 times look thank you we love you. dude guy couldn't be sweeter man. congratulations take back that hygiene [ __ ]. yeah i [ __ ] up did we judge and we live and we learn. right we live in maybe he's not part. of duck dynasty but if that. guy hasn't shot a duck. i would be [ __ ] absolutely shy. he's probably i don't judge but he's shot. a duck he shot. a duck and so um look um i i i think that. this is one of those things. that you is so beautiful. and so amazing that you don't necessarily want. to do a thing and have it. overshadow how beautiful the moment. is i think the surprise is just the fact. that it's happening surprising them. is fine but have them. show up and be like guys i have a surprise for you. the baby's here like i don't think that. there needs to. be some sort of what's the best. way to surprise them because the surprise. is a surprise within itself. and it's already the most beautiful. thing in the world i agree. about the baby the name. could be a cool surprise you could when when you know. the name right. oh the other day. when you surprised it with the kid. that's that's good but then take the baby's shirt. off and have it say clinton and a tattoo on it. no that's too you shouldn't. tattoo anyone uh tattoo the baby was just born. with clinton on it no cross the chest. oh man that's emotional actually. not that tattoo thing but like just have just be like clinton meet clinton jr. that would be really sweet. that would be really really sweet. clinton's a cool name actually clinton meet clinton first. name uh but yeah i don't know. i mean i agree with you actually. you don't want to. like get caught up. plus you want to. enjoy it you don't. want to get caught up. in like the surprise has to. be great like the surprise. is the the thing is already agreeing. already it's already the best exactly. exactly um yeah don't overshadow something. small and cute if you really want to. do something but don't make it a whole thing. yeah yeah okay cool hey chris hey matt i'm a huge fan. of the show um just a huge fan. in general i will be in jacksonville. in december so i look forward. to seeing chris then uh but my question. today is about my boyfriend. and golf so genuinely greatest. boyfriend in the world i know. everyone says that but he is incredible. i don't really have any complaints other than he's recently. been playing golf like more. and more over the past year. or so to. the point where it's like three four times. a week and sometimes he'll go. at like four pm it doesn't get home. until like nine pm which kind of interferes. with our chill time. we'll like leave town on. the weekend go golf. in other places i just feel like he's starting. to put it before me. in certain ways i'm happy. he's passionate about it. but i just kind of wanted to. get your opinion if you feel like i should say something. before it gets to. the point where it starts. to interfere with our relationship just want. your general take on guys who are super obsessed with golf. um so yeah just want your opinion. and thanks for letting me. come on the show his cheat. [laughter] is that what we call. it golf i mean all guys thought just the same. any guy listening to. that was like oh [ __ ] dude so does he leaves. town for the weekend uh and goes to. cabo and [ __ ] the golf. courses smell like perfume and coming back smelling like a lot of perfume yeah perfume uh i thought they golf he said it was all day golf all you should do is say he's not cheap we're joking yeah all you should do is say hey babe i love to. see you golf every time. you go send me a picture. of you on the golf. course because you think that then you can. appreciate cheating oh i don't think he's. cheating yeah i mean if he's cheating he's a [ __ ] idiot from saying he's always golfing right yeah it's so easy to. [ __ ] fight he just gets dressed up and [ __ ] clackety clack clack crack out the house and then just i think man that wrong with the [ __ ] you know what i mean oh oh about to. finish four i mean i if the question. is should you say something. definitely that's too that. is so much [ __ ] golfing that is an obscene. amount of golfing that's the guys. the guy can't stop golfing cannot. stop going on a golf. three or four times a week. goes away on the weekends to. go golfing yeah four p.m to. nine p.m that is too much. to do time thing is weird. oh it does stay. light it does stay light to. later especially if you're in the south but it's too much. to do anything though it's too much. time doing anything besides work yeah what does. he do is he hey is he a golfer. what the [ __ ] what did she's like by the way. my boyfriend is [ __ ] tiger woods phil. mickelson by the way my boyfriend. is that [ __ ] guy with the weird. haircut who was super fat and [ __ ] huge mad guy. oh john daly nicholas nicole nichol. john daley oh no. john daly yes um yeah uh i mean dude. just be like why do you [ __ ] golf. so much how about that. man take it back. to the [ __ ] old school dude you want you want to. go back to the 90s. with this dude and be like hey by the way. why the [ __ ] do you golf. so much yeah what are you. running from dude what are you running. from that maybe is a little too confrontational. get to work base. it but when you do bring it. up don't be like don't do what. he's saying at all don't be like why. do you like to. golf be like i'm kind of missing. you and i think maybe we could cut back. a little bit so we kind of split. it a bit more because i think you're home. less and less and i i would like to. have time with us. quality time in our relationship that isn't necessarily like rushed. because you gotta [ __ ] go out to. play golf waking up at [ __ ] 1. a.m yeah you got to. go golf yeah going to. golf babe it's night time. can't stop golfing dude uh it's so funny. to think like what if he is cheating and he's just is so disrespectful. that he won't think of even another lie. like he's just like golf. yeah where were you golf. showing up in like not golf. clothes i was golfing uh so wants to. get caught yeah yeah um that's just too. much golf that's too much. anything honestly if he was hanging out with you that. much that'd be annoying. that's what i'm saying it's it's too. much of anything he's maybe he's an addict he's got that. kind of personality but like yeah. yeah yeah yeah and maybe it'll burn out. soon but bring it at least. bring it up but but honestly when you do don't make it sound like a judgment. about on him about how he likes to. golf make it about you and how you're me. either missing him or thinking maybe you should spend more. time together i don't know i think you should be judgmental. you should be like god what cookies. golf huh a lot lately. and he says yeah well and she'd be like i just i don't. know i wouldn't do that. if it were me well she's not gonna get what she wants. if she does that be passive aggressive all. right next holding her head. on hey guys love. your show love your energy. laugh um here's my question. for you so i have a person in my life. who anytime i share a story with them. about something that happened. to me that week or it. doesn't matter in the past. their response to my story is. to share with me yeah. a very detailed oneup story oh. dude better than my story and i didn't notice. it at first but once i started to. notice that she was doing this. all the time um i would just kind of like busy. myself her boyfriend just left. around me to. try to give her some social. clues like hey shut up. i don't care it's not. that i don't ever want to. hear a story from her it's just she does. this every single time. well i started noticing that she does. this to other people and their responses. are very similar to. mine where you can. just tell that they immediately become worse. it's terrible kind of thinking the same. thing like hey shut up. so my question to. you is i'm not sure whether this habit. of theirs is born out of like some narcissism or the spectrum. just insecurity should i say something to. them and just like hey do you realize that. you do this and stop doing it. thanks guys okay. the first thing is she thinks that's how you have conversations. she's not trying to. oneup you no i don't think. yeah i think that's how you're supposed. to talk well she's just wrong. but even though even though. even if you're not right. which you you definitely could be i think. that you shouldn't uh that. you should err on the side. of she's not doing it. to try and [ __ ] oneup you she's definitely not yeah okay yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah not cool definitely not. that but i honestly. think that when people do something. that peop that makes people uncomfortable. like that they're they're it's it. it is probably rooted in some kind of insecurity. but it actually is how they think a conversation. is supposed to. go they think they're doing it. right yeah maybe that they're insecure. and sort of panicking coming up. with something right just to. say it but i think it's still worth. bringing up and you can ask i don't. think you should say stop doing that. but you can ask why. she does it you could do. that or you could [ __ ] do the exact opposite. which is make a crazier make your stories crazier. and crazier so she can't [ __ ] match your stories tell her [ __ ] yeah well dude it was crazy i robbed two banks. one summer what do you gotta say. to that dude and she want. people to match. you and then she'll realize the error. of her ways hey i jumped. out of a plane twice once with a parachute on and the other one i found a guy falling through the sky with a parachute. on and i grabbed him and we both parachuted. down what do you got to. say to that she'll realize the error. in her ways and then she'll probably stop doing. it yeah or you could just ask her. why she does it yeah. either one is equal um i just you know people like this. are so annoying i like it's like you know a lot. of comics do it but it's like let the joke. i live in this. world where i'll do it. and then people like i like to. let people's jokes kind of breathe. you know they get the laugh. like somebody says some [ __ ] and before i tag it. up and give it a [ __ ] one two you know let me put that joke. on the [ __ ] speed bag do you know what i'm talking. about before i start. [ __ ] dang it dang it with the joke. that's out there [ __ ] drying. in the air before i do. that i'll let it hang okay. and then i'll [ __ ] put it on the speed bag. and dang it to. dang it up right. and i respect if somebody lets. me do that with my joke. too if i do a joke. and then they [ __ ] come in like joe coy and just oh yeah and also this and [ __ ] don't let my joke. be carefree and fancy. out there for a little bit it's annoying. as [ __ ] dude stop doing that joe coy do you understand. what i'm saying okay sounds like you got a little bit of a deeper. issue it's just he would always do it. when we hang out and [ __ ] and it's annoying. okay so yeah that's annoying. and you are right to. be annoyed by that. but i think uh know that. she's not trying to. compete or would not be thinks that's how conversations actually. go give her the benefit of the doubt. but feel free to. ask her why she does. it however try not to. be like stop doing that i hate. when you do that anything. like that uh you're more likely. to get the result you want. if you just ask her and sort of probe and she'll probably. get the idea right okay. cool next okay can't believe you. hey chris matt love the show. i need some quick advice. so i got a message from my ex's. brother's wife um they want to. do an open relationship um she said she's interested. in me but it's weird. because i know her family i know. that they have kids it's a new. thing for them and i don't really want to. be the guinea pig. but dude she's so [ __ ] hot okay um i thought about her before he let that dude come out. right there you see a hot. woman you think about it. and dick says yes brain. says no um who's nick so what do. i do thanks guys hi. i'm dick yes um so i'm sorry. i need time to. process that x's brother's wife yeah. x's brother wants to. bring this guy into. the bedroom so basically his former brotherinlaw almost. not even though they weren't. married not really his wife. ex's brother but not exwife right right. right okay um okay and they want to. have an open relationship and and the brothers. assuming uh he's okay. with the two they agreed. to have an open. registration yeah and they want to. use this guy i mean [ __ ] her what do you what do it. yeah well i don't understand. i mean well i mean it. depends on how close he is with his ex. if it's if it's a [ __ ] ex of three weeks it's horrible idea. oh yeah if it's an excellent. five years i assumed. it was a long. time if you're not in the person's life. then yeah i assume that was a long. time yeah you're right i mean. it's definitely gonna make her feel a certain type of way. if you don't give a [ __ ] and if it's been six years then okay. i don't think it matters. that much but if you guys just broke up. and you like literally like if she was like if you were like it's over. hey what's up chris and matt. like if you did it like that. right yeah then you're gonna [ __ ] doing this is definitely going to. make your life more stressful. than it is i'll i'll say that. so in that respect. it better be very boner. inducing do you know what i mean. but let's assume like most people he doesn't even. talk to his ex. anymore that yeah that's over. with and it's done. with and it's in the past. yeah if this is some like think of it. as somebody again yeah maybe you're going. to hear from here it's going. to make your life more. stressful and i'm just saying that. stress has to equal. the inducement of the boner. do you understand yeah i do but she asked. him right yeah she asked him. yeah it wasn't his idea. okay yeah i mean even though. he looks at you from. lincoln park it wasn't his it does yeah and so what you do. is you balance you take the stress. to the boner inducing. scale you take it. to the bone reducing skill. that's what you do you. say kenzie dude remember when kinsey had the orgasm in the movie when liam neeson was playing him and he was like i can orgasm in like 12 and in like two seconds you know and he just goes dude. kenzie was a [ __ ] up guy i know dude i just watched a documentary. and it [ __ ] mentioned him and apparently he would do crazy [ __ ] up [ __ ] and have crazy scales made like 11 month olds come hey kinsey you're cancelled no no i know but like what the [ __ ] we're catching john wayne because he says something in playboy magazine you made 11 year olds come i know 11 month olds come i know dude crazy [ __ ] dude canceling people because they [ __ ] you know what i mean god because they were on remember when they tried to. cancel roseanne barr for doing the [ __ ] that. you did because you tweeted. something on ambien do you know. what i mean and yeah i almost got roseanne yeah yeah. you almost got [ __ ] roseanne but the [ __ ] like she said something actually racist which is actually pretty [ __ ] up it is i know but she didn't know she didn't know but i know but it's harder to. be like i was on ambien. when you're like i don't remember what she's. being remember what she did me. neither i think it was. a racist thing okay i don't know. uh anyway uh but yeah quincy's can kinsey's cancelled. you should just [ __ ] that woman yeah uh you have to. put on the scale on the boner. inducement scale kinsey you have to. [ __ ] look at it and be like the straw the stress level is so so where you look and you get a six the stress level is at six now when we bring it over. to the boner inductor boner. and doctor you know we we look. so not scientific we look. at the boner inducement of. this you know we look at her. hourglass figure and we look at her. titties and there it'd come out further. than her hips but her hips at the bottom become big. so that is titties we we equate her boner. inducement to a 7.5 so you have 1.5 to. play with the stress is six and the boner. induction so what it is you have a point. you have a point 1.5 plus. on the bone reducement scale so go have an open relationship. deleted scenes from mckinsey. and cut we got it all. right yeah all right. yeah [ __ ] lifeline it's uh it's mr cuban link. from foreign indiana oh wow. jesus i hope you guys are in your threeseater. ferrari with your dad. yeah top down titties exposed okay. that's right it's got a little lifeline. uh we planted some pumpkins. out in our backyard okay uh july. on the left side. of the trees is my property. on the right side. as my neighbors planted our. pumpkins on the left side of the trees. then a couple weeks later. uh neighbors mowed it over oh pretty. pissed about a uh little brm. well what do you guys. think the repercussions are for that. let me know i know i know. what the reproduction pumpkins. on their side. yeah yeah threat syndrome plan. yeah for real pumpkins on their side. direct confrontation eye contact direct confrontation. knock on the door. knock knock knock door. opens direct eye contact why did you mow. my pumpkins uh did they mean to. are you gonna find out. when you ask him did you mow. over my pumpkins on purpose. or not and now be careful. because you don't want mr. cuban link coming out. no but i think you should say. why did you do it. and then let them say what if they don't know. what you're talking about yeah. and if you'll know you'll be able. to read that oh so you think that maybe they did it. and they don't even know. dude pumpkins are very visible that's what you brought you asked. did they do it i'm probably. i know i know i know so what are you you're [ __ ]. telling me i'm i'm i'm just going. along with you you mow. my pumpkins i don't like when my pumpkins are smashed i don't like smashing pumpkins. despite all my range i'm still just around. the cage yeah dude. they'll know what you mean. um that was cool when you sing it's cool. when i sing too. no it's honestly just cool. mostly when i sing no. ah and i want to. be honest and i hate saying. it flood of comments. about how good i am. since the last two episodes. are unreal i love. you all i appreciate you all. i know you love my singing. chris hates it you know. he's wrong like that. you're all great dude. you can't do it like that. what does that mean. you can't do i can't do it. like this despite all my range. i'm still just the canes. you can't do it like i don't. want to do it. like that well whatever bro. okay anyway ask him dude. confront direct eye contact why did you mow. my pumpkins they're your neighbor. just knock on their door. no hi why did your mama probably. yeah do it exactly all right. cool why did you mow. my disgusting pumpkin sunny bloomfield new. jersey oh [ __ ] in my home. studio nice close to. where we're from yes i'm a musician uh questions. got to do with that. what do you guys. do when you get a writer's. block i know you all are both. creative yeah if you got any tips. for us any little things. you like to do to. keep it fun um let me know i'd love to. hear back and uh there are folks. in this world that get it. and that don't and i really feel like you all. too get it so appreciate you. keep doing what you're doing. i don't have a sound board. so i'm just gonna play myself. out see you later oh [ __ ] this guy's [ __ ] cool oh this [ __ ] took him all afternoon to. do you know what i mean. it took him all afternoon to. do that video that was dope. neglected [ __ ] duties that he had as a [ __ ] you know what i mean friend and parent or whatever he was late picking up his wife at the airport where have you been sorry dude look what i made yeah she forgave him for sure yeah she goes who's that four and they go these guys and go oh that's really cool uh i think that writers my advice to. write people who ask about writer's. block is always the same. which is that in my experience of course i get writer's. block and when i do when i panic. or get mad at myself. or try to. like do some [ __ ] thing to. power through it it actually makes it. worse you gotta [ __ ] cut the cord. and let it go and then you will. circle back quicker and quicker to. good writing than you. would have if you either like put pressure on yourself. made yourself do it [ __ ] got mad at yourself whatever the [ __ ] you just gotta [ __ ] let it happen it'll pass. quicker if you do that so if you just relax. and succumb to. the writer's block come to. the right so come to. the right if you come to. the right yeah come down so all right. so then you what you do. is you re you what if it. lasts like a week it. won't got it wow. you're so confident with this [ __ ] dude it won't unless you're like then it will last away. you know if you think you're [ __ ] a bad writer because you why can't i just like it happens. your brain is just doing a thing that naturally. happens that was crazy when you went oh that was literally. what i was doing. when my friends were opting to. burn themselves alive last night. that was what i was doing. for real i woke up to. it and then i felt like i fell. asleep again and then i woke. up to kristen moving her [ __ ] and it hit my chest. and i go oh and i had a [ __ ] heart and my [ __ ] was pounding for so long i couldn't get back to. sleep and then i did an hour. later and then i woke up to. her about 10 minutes later. [ __ ] looking at instagram didn't get good sleep. all cause of her and my friends. were opting to. [ __ ] burn alive in my head all good dude. i mean that might be more. why you had a bed. night sleep than kristen you. know i think though you know. bad dream will [ __ ] up. at night dude a whole day. whole next day i had a dream. where i [ __ ] tripped at a party. and i shot a gun. and a bullet hit daddy. even though he's at the party. and dad died because i shot him. and i was like just ruin the entire [ __ ] next. two days senator can we please get back to. what the issue here healthcare. um yeah anyway uh let it [ __ ] pass. it will it's my advice. let it pass just let it wash. over you how about that. okay yeah right yeah okay hi. guys a huge fan i'm a true. baby for life um but i'm gonna say that. this podcast actually might be my new favorite my question. today is how would you react. to my situation um check this. out i have a stepmom that has stressed me out for 20. years i have completely bit. my tongue and not brought up. any kind of issue with her. for the sake of everyone around. me my sister my dad um and it's just eating away. at me um she's just very passive aggressive it's not. even that crazy i just find her very stressful. to be around and as soon as i had my son. um who's calvin's age and i'm pregnant. with my second right. now i just found it. even harder to. deal with yeah um sure i kind of blew. up on her a little bit for the first. time ever a couple weeks. ago and i'm just deciding. now i think it's time. to cut ties with her. stepmother obviously but that means possibly. losing my relationship with my dad. and i've also um experienced. some guilt from my sister. because it's going to. make her life harder um wow. i think i know what the right. call is and i think i know. what you guys will say but i need your advice. to help pump me up um when i'm having moments. of weakness with this decision. because i've never put my foot down. or or established any boundaries. i'm also eight months pregnant. and you're in the right. mindset to be doing this. so if you have any personal. experience that you can give me for reference. or any other advice that would be great. thanks bye what a cutie so. i think right now do whatever. you want because you're eight. months pregnant just [ __ ] like don't don't like you can even block a [ __ ] number if you want or even your dad's too it's like your right mind's trying to. do what you got to. do and don't worry about explaining. it to anybody i think ultimately a lot. in the long run. because if you do want to. keep a relationship with your dad. i would say maybe you you want. to just let her know look if we're going to. stay in touch if we're going to. have a relationship i need it. to be like this and this. is what i need from you. and this is what i need you to. stop doing and then if she can't do that then you walk away. and cut the cord knowing you. actually did try to. actually just cut the cord. without giving them the opportunity. to meet the criteria that. you have you it's not that. that's a bad idea it's something. that's morally wrong i think. you might end up living. with some kind of regret. if you give this woman the chance. to actually uh be the kind of person. that you want her to. be in your life at least. uh then i think that going. forward even if she can't do it. you will feel better about. yourself and your own life. okay so i did the joke. where uh her face opened. up and another face came out. right and was a demon. and had a big tongue. and goes oh you know. yeah and i missed. what is her stepmom doing she's just passive aggressive and like making her. we shouldn't get that specific but yeah she's clearly being pretty. [ __ ] terrible yeah okay um button pushing i think is the vibe i got dude. such a [ __ ] [ __ ] up like you don't choose. your family you know. like you gotta [ __ ] be i mean you can i guess when you get to. certain you can choose. to not be around. them but like it's so [ __ ] annoying because like this doesn't just affect her and her stepmom. this also this will affect her. dad this will affect her. sister yes suspect everyone so you have to. kind of tread lightly even. though i what i think is you look. you blew up it was eight. months you're eight months pregnant. you blew up that's understandable. right because your hormones are going crazy. you've got you're you're you're two people. right now not feel bad about that. yeah so don't feel bad about it. i think that the number one. thing is don't feel bad about how you're feeling. and don't feel guilty about anything. you're a good person obviously. you can tell that just by this. and like just just give yourself permission. to not feel a certain way. about how you're feeling. right exactly like you feel the way. you feel and that's fine. i think that's the number one. thing and number two you just got to. be direct and be like look you know you're being passive aggressive or whatever. the [ __ ] you want to. say it's it's too much. and it's it's it's affecting me. and maybe it's something we can both. talk through i mean dude. we have instances in our lives. where we deal with. passive aggressive people all the time. and like and uh and it's hard. and it sucks and you know. i i guess i don't know if you do figure it out. let me know too because i need to. know i i think something you said. is important though like don't put uh any kind of like edge. or judgment or glean on. the way she's making you feel. she's making you feel that way. don't be like ah i hate that. she's making me mad i hate that. i'm getting upset at this. that's just a compounding of the problem. like she's doing it that's the end. of it you have your brain. she has hers they react. in a certain way and there's nothing anybody can. [ __ ] do about it it's about how to. move on from that whether that's with her. in your life or not. be aware of compounding the. problem the problem already exists. don't add any more. to it it's already there. for you uh but yeah don't [ __ ] feel bad about anything if you end up having to. cut out of your life. [ __ ] her it's her fault. yeah cutter chord like you're going. to cut that umbilical chord oh. baby when it comes out. but i'm just saying like there's gonna be two chords at the same. time being symbolic like i'm cutting. this chord and also in my mind. i'm cutting the chord for the stepmom. in fact say it when the doctors cut the yeah do you know. what this means like this. with your you know what you know. what that is too symbolic. of to the doctor yeah. the doctor said okay stay still please. no because what happened. is my my stepmom is really annoying. and she's passiveaggressive so when when we're cutting. this chord i'm imagining. that it's the chord in the mind. in my mind for the stepmom. uh because she's very passionate. i don't want it's actually like this. [laughter] snip ma'am leave please. all right what's the baby's name. hi guys i am from. norway and i work as a production. dancer and the word lets. me travel all over the world. and i have to. speak english a lot. but i've not resided in one place. for long enough to pick. up either a british. accent or uh i was gonna make that joke. so i've just kept my norwegian. one yeah i have a broad. vocabulary and i don't have a hard. time making myself understood in most situations. so it works fine. my problem is whenever i do. a contract in a country. that speaks english as their first language. and this is solemnly. countries that has english as their first. language i get hassle a lot. for my accent and it includes. comments about how i pronounce different. words or my tone and the way. i speak or what is. most common is i get asked. probably four or five times a day. where are you from oh. you have an accent. and this includes like grocery. store where i buy food. and she would ask do you want. to pay cash or card. and i would say card. please and she would say oh you have an accident. where are you from usually. i will politely tell them. that i'm from norway and most. of the times they would have no. idea where norway is what. norway is and i don't see. it as my job to. educate them and explain geography and i find. it a waste of my time. because it's happening so many times a day. that i would love if you could help. me find a concise response. which i can reply and kind of shut down. the conversation or is this. a perfect time for a spin move or should i sit. down and learn an accent. and which one dude. thank you life i was in i was in thank you. for your uh submission my i was in uh high school. and remember uh dojun oh yeah. he oh yeah he was what was he he was uh korean. he's joined the army remember he was korean. south korean army yeah. oh my god to fight. against kim jongun really yeah jesus. christ i mean him up at his doorstep like uh hi uh can i talk to. you you know i mean. i always used to. do that i imagine him. in the army you know. hey is chris holm um so uh yeah. just like this yeah yeah yeah yeah is kim kim jong. un is he [laughter] and he would say to. me i have been working on my uh english. accent you want to. hear and i would say sure. and then i'll never forget. this and he leaned into. my ear really close and he said he said let's have lunch. and i'll never forget. that dude do that learn. to learn a [ __ ] regular english accent or or it's so un it's i feel bad for her it's really annoying if someone has a spin move it's great. it is a spin move nor. norway it's a good time. for a spin move but interesting yes i'm interesting. outside because norway i think you. could just also just be like chicago. you know what i mean. it's like never explain honestly. you'll get a laugh and you'll just be able. to [ __ ] probably get out of a lot of the situations. or quicker if you just say narnia. right and then they'll be like but i and you're already spinning you're already. gone yeah you've already seen. um that's been mentality so. uh yeah or uh just say yeah. i just either do a joke. or just be like to. be like i am hello. paper plastic yes i am from i am from. exactly jacksonville right yeah. yeah yeah yeah let's have lunch. atlanta i am from atlanta. let's have lunch okay yeah. that is so annoying though i'm sorry. about american speaking countries. dude american speaking you know you know how we do it hey guys loving. the new podcast so basically. my exhusband and i we're together for 10. years we've been apart. now for four he's had a girlfriend. that whole time i've had a boyfriend. for the last three i'm actually pregnant. do like any day. now so super exciting but we both. moved on and we're good like no. beef at all the issue. is his sister is a real nasty. little c word who made it very clear. the entire relationship that she hated me. for no reason and she is pissed. because we never officially. signed divorce papers initially we weren't. sure what we were doing for a while. and then it just wasn't a big. deal to us because we weren't fighting. over anything so paperwork is stargate at this. point but she keeps going out of her. way to harass me. through different social medias she keeps making new accounts. to just randomly unprovoked message. me and calling me a ton of nasty. names and being awful. to me so i keep blocking her. i don't know what to. do my ex is so upset. by this like he's the sweetest person. he just keeps telling her. to leave me alone. she's almost 40 like i shouldn't even be a thought in her. life at this point i don't get it. so what do i do. thanks guys dude. people are so weird with that social media. i know people it's like what did. this person do in the 90s. sickness just sat down and was pissed. off yeah dude just roll. letters you know this is so weird. dude it's like a weird like uh it's like an epidemic. it's like a social contagion. or something the way. people know about this [ __ ] um i i don't even know what you could do i mean you're doing the right. thing you're just blocking continue like ignoring. don't engage um i mean her ex. should handle it though yeah but if you were doing this. to an ex of mine. i'd be like chris what the [ __ ] is wrong. with you and it would make you stop right. somehow yeah that doesn't make any sense. but if i'm mentally uh this. woman is disabled mentally. unstable no question that's the issue. somebody needs to like get her. help unless so weird unless the x's. which it doesn't sound like it. the x is telling her one. thing and also doing a different. thing like being like yeah no writer you know. what i mean but they've been cool. the whole time i don't yeah. yeah well she's maybe it was tumultuous. at some point but it never was she says. there should be some sort of like uh what do they call. it uh when you when you call um the the authorities. on somebody you to. to check on them. and and and they take them. to a mental place. what do they call it. it's like they you're 86. in someone or something yeah. not 86 50 150. uh. that there should be that kind of a thing. with social media like like you get to. call somebody and then they get locked out. of their all of their accounts. right yeah and they got to. go to like or some [ __ ] i don't know yeah or like they get visited like this is real life mental health but this is real life like people think social media is just social media yeah but it's real life dude this [ __ ] woman is causing actual mental harm. and stress to. people i've been on the other industry like that before not. that specifically yeah yeah but it's like it's awful. dude it is yeah it's really. really it actually doesn't bother. me but it's bothered people around. me so so so much and i've seen the pain. it causes people it's really dark. [ __ ] yeah i mean that woman needs. extreme help yeah it's me. uh it's not you but it is. youtube but that's what i was thinking. about um i'm telling you woman. needs help but it's also she's pregnant. dude that's crazy like she's about to. pop a baby out nothing's. wrong with this woman she's scary. she's scared of me. i'm scared i'm scared i'm upset. man i'm scared i think that honestly it's the guy. you got to have a clear. conversation i know the guy's upset. your ex but you got to. have a clear conversation with him. and be like yo you gotta talk. to you gotta we something has to. be done i'm eight months. pregnant whatever the [ __ ] it is like this woman is stressing me out i can't be a new mom and be dealing with blocking these [ __ ] finsta accounts yeah you know please please help if you haven't had that conversation have that conversation yes exactly and then uh also uh congratulations on your baby yeah i'll be in dallas uh i'll be in wichita i'll be in atlanta and i'll be in washington dc uh and savannah georgia go hit up chris leah dot com for tickets and uh we got a bunch of new merch that just came out and we're working on lifeline merch we got that coming out so coming soon uh if you got a question for us click the link in the description below or go to. watchlifeline dot com uh pretty. soon i got something special for you guys. too uh coming up. i think you're gonna like it's this. and uh do you remember pearl jam do you. have a project yeah. you don't though in the middle. of when you were [ __ ] singing. uh yeah don't call me. daughter dude that is un. if i saw that that would be so no. brave [ __ ] up for me you know what i would do if you were doing that. and i was really worried. about it we were gonna play and i'd do it. with you i would start singing. with you and i would be like sorry. that's just what we do. right we're doing it as a sovereign. foreign fun thing yeah like a bad 80s. movie oh yeah so anyway right. right thanks man appreciate that. then we'd walk off the plane. and and the music. would play over the track. and don't call me. a daughter in slow. motion yeah anyway [music] hello.
