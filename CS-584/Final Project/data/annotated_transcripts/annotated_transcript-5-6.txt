whole podcast. over that's adam i am. i did all right look. this is what i'm gonna do. i'm gonna talk about this. because it's been in my notes. for literally five months it's called. i wrote down the deserve it. scale all right and one fire. is always like what the [ __ ] is the deserve. it scale and it's been on the notes. and we laugh because it's so dumb. the deserve it scale. made about as much sense. to him as a skip. all right the deserve it. scale is is i think we might have maybe touched. on this in a podcast. before but a video online. of a guy falling just a guy. falling and he doesn't deserve it. is not as it can. be funny there's always exceptions. but the deserve it. scale is what makes it funny. to me okay if a guy's twirling plates. on a [ __ ] basketball and falls down his deserve it. scale is off the charts. and i'm [ __ ] laughing harder. because he's a [ __ ] idiot you understand. i know he's gonna fall and he doesn't there. was a video of a kid. on top of a fruit. of a cupboard this is a long time. ago in on america's funniest. home videos you know back. when the internet wasn't a thing. and this kid was on the top. of the cupboard and he was gonna scare he set up. the camera who's gonna scare his family. and it was just gonna be great. right set up the whole. thing the kid goes rawr. and slips his pants. catch on the top of the cupboard. and he falls down and his ass. crack is facing the camera. now that deserve it scale. is off the charts because he set it. all up stood on the cupboard and waited for his dad. so it was so what funny. dude here's another good one. man one time there's a guy skiing. down a mountain bro i lost my [ __ ] at this okay. and he was skiing. down the mountain and the guy. was at the bottom of the [ __ ] slow. filming it it was like a you know like so i'm so far away. the guy was just shh she's. doing the [ __ ] [ __ ] ass [ __ ] that skiers do shh shh you're a super [ __ ] of your skiing. you know and he gets close. to the guy with the camera. and the guy with the camera. you can just sense you know. there was just like a sense. that he had where he was like uhoh. some shits about to. go down and the guy go the guy. skiing says oh sorry chris and then smashes into. the guy with the camera oh because he said sorry. before i pissed bro. if you know you're gonna [ __ ] up can't stop and apologize beforehand the desert. scales so high first of all don't even. [ __ ] shoot it just let the guy live life the best. deserve it scale though i ever. saw was at a wedding. this was a funniest home. videos i've looked this video. up forever online there was a wedding. going on and the i guess. it was the groom that. on the indoors wedding you know. gymnasium or wherever the [ __ ] this. thing was he gets on. the motorcycle that was there for some reason. okay now the deserve it. scale dude is that mach 10. all right this guy's on it. first of all motorcycle in a gymnasium. that's not it at a wedding. that's not it at his wedding. all right the deserve it. scale i mean if there was a weight. sensor it would be oh okay. now this guy revs it. and he is just he seems dope. as [ __ ] okay cuz he had on i remember he had on like uh uh not a traditional thing he hadn't like a cool thing because he wanted to. look cool on the motorcycle thing and and he went to. take off and you go. to and obviously didn't know how to. ride a motorcycle that well because he didn't let go. of the handle and the [ __ ] motorcycle kept going and he was doing like the rule and he tried to. stand up off of it. because it got too and the motorcycle went. into all the decorations. and took out all the decorations. and ruined the wedding. dude and i cried. the desert scale was [ __ ] mach 10 and i think that's when i created the desert. scale when i was a kid. anyway what i want you. to do because i love deserve. at scale videos send your favorite deserve. it scale videos okay. now you know there's different. levels like the skiing. one wasn't so high but the motorcycle at the wedding. one was just off the charts. right you ever see the grape smash. one where the girls. like okay and go and they're on a level. up and they're smashing the grapes. and it's a [ __ ] you know middleaged woman. that's like portly and she's like go. go go go go go go and then she falls off. of the [ __ ] level thing and then he's like remember that video did you ever see a fire. at one fire you seen. it oh man let's watch that one. that one is such a high. deserve at scale oh man. when i would watch this. on ebaum's world when i was [ __ ] 12. smashing fail she's so out of breath. great lady falls original so sad. to be the great. lady what kind of great these are filled with chamber. sin grapes and the winner this saturday is stop music best. thing is they both they both. have [ __ ] zero clue that this shit's about to. go down and my favorite thing. about it is i know. it's gonna go down that's the best. because otherwise why would it even. be on the internet when dude i used to. love america's own videos because they would [ __ ] show. the video and you knew you. were smarter than the [ __ ] idiot on the veteran camera you knew some [ __ ] was gonna go down and they had no idea and i would just sit there giddy with anik looking oh i can't wait for this guy to. fall and they would fall and i would the [ __ ] would just be an uber sensation. you're they are here they're there. on a [ __ ] platform that's like i mean it's like three and a half. feet up what a bad. [ __ ] idea dude and why are they wearing the same thing. because they work for the place. and it's a sad. the whole thing here we go. oh i remember what happens. to before we've been watching she stops and they like okay. stop and then this is what made it. extra funny she was like wait a little bit. more and that's when she falls it's a lot. of fun [music] ohohohoh. yeah buddy what makes you say. that you [ __ ] regular guy and the winner this saturday international music. okay she says stop now she's even though. it's a joke it's it's what. she gets it's what she gets man. i'm sorry lady but you're on a [ __ ] four foot platform up that. is so small it could be an elevator it's the size. of an elevator and then you're stomping slippery gray. and then you don't stop after you say stop and even as a joke. that's not the rules. lady you said stop you said it. by the way and then she goes she goes a little bit more. like a [ __ ] bro we've all been there she can't not breathe out. because it hit and she can't not. breathe out she's in so much pain that she just lets. a little bit of sound out and it just turns. in it she can't. think of breath in bro. that's so funny i feel bad. but she's probably okay that's the bit. you know does the other thing. too if you know. they've done some permanent damage. and it's not funny anymore. cuz you feel bad but i think this lady's okay. she's at the top she's at. the top level of i think she's okay. if she went any further then it's not. okay like those skateboarding videos. where people fall down and break their femurs. i'm not into that this. [ __ ] here she's saying stop she doesn't realize what she's saying because there's nothing to. be stopped that's the bet that's also very funny. because she's just saying stop because she's like praying to. the gods that this. should stop but you can't no look. at these guys i think she's actually hurt. no i think she is hurt. she took a hard fall off there well hey gosh. i hope she's okay okay we're gonna make sure she yes right. check on her and get back as soon as we can we'll be. back right after this oh man. okay let's read about her. here the go up yeah. so okay okay oh wow there's a whole. story here oh okay melissa sanders. was a reporter for an atlanta tv station. in the late 90s. doing a fluff report from a local. winery she participated in an impromptu. grape stomping contest when disaster hilariously struck. memo to parents. if this is what i was saying if you really want to. show your kids that cheaters never prosper you might want. to consider using this. video as visual. aid exactly even though it. was a [ __ ] light competition you stop when you say stop after being told that time was up. stander kept by though it was her that said the time. was up i mean look at the way. this is written sander. kept stomping and was quickly. bitchslapped by the hand of fate tumbling over the side. you know her wall bursts. like screams while obviously i mean. who wrote this well obviously amusing her. her coworkers in the studio. know they were sad. seem to indicate a serious. injury there's somebody in the comments. section claiming sander broke several ribs. and almost died oh come on. they think it's funny. or that way they're saying. push it go back up she was fine. said she was fine. click on that oh wait hold. on and by the way was basically her. fault because they chose. to film facing the side. yeah really without railings click on that. know that oh you got it. okay go back yeah. go tree down honore down. according to bloggers who have tried. to track her down shortly after the incident sander left. atlanta for albany which we're sure had nothing. to do with the fact. that the institute's were barely holding. back giggles and her pain yodeling our bio. page is a bio page. in albany makes no but no mention of a neardeath experience. due to pierce too long. a pierson which further supports the i mean. what the [ __ ] is this you know if people will just be like think anything's a conspiracy. she's no longer the jaw. dropped off the face of the earth. let's try to. find her you know go up. go up click her bio page. right there oh there it. is he's probably not up. anymore right yeah it's not there. anymore well we wish her. all the best here. at congratulations you know um but the desert. scale was mighty high on. that one wasn't quite as big. as the [ __ ] motorcycle in them but man. no railings if i was working there. and that happened while she was falling. i'd be like i mean we knew it. yeah you want to. do some questions okay it's got some questions. oh a grumble oh well hmm. a lot of people don't know what's a [ __ ] means but this is a good one. page at legs for days. i guess change it probably. cuz that's you know. how [ __ ] is it to. be the first person scooting in a corner. booth at a restaurant yeah yeah because you got to. be like use your [ __ ] palms and scoot. yeah it's pretty [ __ ] boot [ __ ] boot it's pretty [ __ ] it's pretty boot it's pretty [ __ ] especially if you're like a [ __ ] white guy that is wearing shorts. you're a [ __ ] major [ __ ] if you do that white guys have the most submit [ __ ] what do you call it what's the what's the word it's a very easy word where you can what's the word where you can wow i came to. think of how to. describe this word but it's a very easy word hold on a guy second babies have to. come through oh jesus. christ what a brain.
