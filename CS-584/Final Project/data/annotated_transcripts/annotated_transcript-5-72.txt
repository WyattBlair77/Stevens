[ __ ] laugh or you don't laugh. back and i [ __ ] use that i feel you out there you're not in the same room. but you in your car in your cubicle in your shower. in your room you're in your dorm. and i feel you out there. because you're a true. baby i wish i was a little bit darker. these days you know what i mean. first of all i'm pale as [ __ ] but second of all being a white guy it's pretty tough it's pretty tough this. week yeah [ __ ] under fire. and you know it's weird. man the whole country is. racist no matter what i can't do. anything about it it's just how it is it's how it's gonna be if if one cop. [ __ ] up all cops [ __ ] up you know one [ __ ] asian guy gets into. a car accident they all can't drive. one white guy [ __ ] takes his dick out all of the white guys take their dick out you know what i mean that's just how it is and there's nothing we can do about it there's no progress you know there's no [ __ ] progress we're trying but not really because everyone's got a goddamn twitter account everyone's got a goddamn twitter account and can tweet anything that they think right away and that's a [ __ ] huge problem to. tweet something that you think is [ __ ] a problem remember writing remember. having to [ __ ] type it out put it on a paper and going to. [ __ ] print it that whole time going to. print it you thought. maybe i shouldn't [ __ ] print this and a lot of people turned around. a lot of people turned around. but now you think hey you know. what [ __ ] all white guys [ __ ] these you know certain groups of people and then you tweet it. out and then everyone [ __ ] swarms and agrees with you and then all of a sudden everybody's you know shitty all comedians are shitty now because of what happened right and it's fine to. make a joke about it. it's fine it's it's [ __ ] good and it's funny. sometimes but you know some people are like [ __ ] these people [ __ ] those people [ __ ] this [ __ ] that think hey man think do the drive if you're gonna tweet something any anything anything this is the rule if you're gonna tweet something do a at least mentally before you tweet it walk down into. your car mentally in your head. go to the [ __ ] car drive mentally. take all the turns to. the nearest kinko where you. were gonna print it out. get to kinko's and mentally. pay for something to. be printed then get it. drive all the way back and home. and if you still want to. tweet it then to. if not don't people with this. [ __ ] i'm gonna say something right now pam dude it's out its out there in the universe. that [ __ ] could get retweeted four. million times and are and there's enough crazy. people out there it doesn't matter people. think it's right people think you're right. people think you're [ __ ] right you can say anything in this world and there will be a group of people that think you're right. that's [ __ ] problem it's a huge problem. you're not right a lot. of the time a lot. of times you're wrong but if you're out. in the internet there's enough wrong. people out there that it's gonna agree. with you and now all of a sudden you got a group you. don't deserve a group just. because you have a twitter is it.
