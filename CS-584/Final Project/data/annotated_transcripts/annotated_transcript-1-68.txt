you know me. i don't drink hot chocolate because i keep it. lean right i mean that's obvious. at this point uh but uh yeah your boy's getting swole. but yeah so we would drove by this weed. place and it had one of those wacky inflatable tube. man things i don't know if that's what you're calling her. if that's what just family. guy calls them wacky inflatable two. man wacky inflatable two. man but you know what i'm talking. about the things at the car. lots and they had it on top. of this weed store and it was a green. one and he was just doing his thing. like you know what i mean. doing this thing where it was the air. was blowing into. it and then my son we were stopped in traffic. a little bit and my son. just says look at that. and i said whoa. look at that buddy he says what. is that and i said oh that's just one. of those green things that's that's that's filling. with air and it's like being like whacking. it's an inflatable tube and he took a beat and he said i'm that. guy and i said that's you and he said uhhuh. and i said oh oh okay. dude this was yesterday. at 1 p.m he's still that guy. he's just going i'm the wacky inflate. i'm i'm inflatable tube guy. i'm a flatable tube guy. to the point where look i'm inflatable too. guy look look i'm a flatable tube guy. to the point where i'm like i know. kids are always like hey look look at this. look at me do this. look at this look at this. and i'm like is my son. just gonna like when does it. stop like i understand wanting to. to like sometimes i walk you know it's like you know what i guess. it's like it's like when you're an adult. and you go and see like a liam neeson movie. and you walk out of the movie. theater and you're like wow. that was a cool movie. i know it's fake but at this. point after seeing that movie. nobody better test me. right i understand that you know. that's fake and all this and and like this is movie magic. because i'm 43 but i just watched. taken and at this point. somebody better not take take test. me at this point somebody. better not test me. right the government take my daughter if i had a daughter. if i would get her back at this. point because it's in taken but um i guess that's what it's like for kids. when you just see the grain green. inflatable tube guy and then you go. ah dude this is my taken. uh because now he's just flipping. around doing the thing and so much we're going to. go see grandma and grandpa. and he was just you'd be like cal. and you'd say no. i'm inflatable tube guy like just okay. but it's like when does it stop i don't know i'm like i'm you know. i i've been a dad. for three and a half. years so it's like now. is the time where the imagination. is just like really like coming. into like its own. and he's just like she's something. like that and he's just like i can be that. guy like as a kid. when you like my butt. my kid my my uh i showed him. peewee herman you know rest in peace because i thought i was like you know what calvin. loved peewee herman so i showed him. pb herman and he was watching me. with her and peewee. herman was doing his dance. and one of the things and i look over. to calvin and and calvin is watching the show. and he says he is so funny. and i was like okay. so he loves purring. but once that inflatable tube. guy happened boom no more. peewee herman now he's like what is it. peepee pee pee i'm like no. it's peewee and so he now. watch it uh could care less could not care. less about peewee and is he wacky flavor. two guy but it's kind of like the thing. because i was telling that. you know uncle matt when he was younger. he was peewee herman for halloween. and kevin was like really and i remember when uncle matt was people remember halloween. he was four i was seven. or eight and he was going. to be peewee. herman and he had a mask. right which is a really a [ __ ] ass way to. go honestly if you're doing halloween as a kid. or an adult but a kid. mostly if you do a costume. where you put a mask. on you're a lazy [ __ ] you know get the makeup. have mom do the makeup. have dad you know what i mean. hire someone maybe that sex is to. say that the dad. would dad could do it. too right mom doesn't have to. do a mom hire someone whatever. it is whoever this is a breadwinner it's most likely the dad. dad hire someone okay um and so my brother. was peewee and he was peewee. you don't when you're a kid. as an as a a halloween. costume i was the punisher. one year and the thing. was you wouldn't have wanted. to test me back then. now yeah i was 11. but you don't want. to test me at that. point right yeah i had a gun that wasn't a real gun that had an orange tip. that didn't shoot bullets. but when i get it. it's not that dangerous but you don't. want to test me. at that point right. because i was the punisher. do you understand i was robbing too. why was i not batman. because i wanted to. do that i wanted to. be the kind of under like everyone's batman. so i wanted to. be i wanted to. be robin and my mom made the robin. costume kinda and yeah in retrospect robin is the [ __ ] ass one but they're both wearing tights right. so it's like up until recently. there they used to. wear tights in the 80s. the superheroes were all tied it. up now they're just it's armor. and [ __ ] you know now it's badass but back then was totally not badass. it was tight city. nobody wanted to play superman so that's what christopher reads. today he wasn't even. a superhero he wasn't even a superstar they were just like no one will do it. warren beatty said no. because you put on the outfit christopher ruiz is like uh. i'll do it boom. then they did four of them. but yeah my son's the green. inflatable tube guy and uh and i did. a [ __ ] killer leg day so things are looking up for both of us. dude i mean i did a [ __ ] killer leg. day and i know that people in my you. know they're like oh chrisley i don't. want to talk don't talk about working. out again well here it comes dude. skip [ __ ] a minute because dude your boy is your boy's hips have been through so much and they and you can tell because they're absolutely crying i mean above the kneecap i got that teardrop that is oh just so ridiculously juicy right i got people coming up to. me now they know i i strictly. do legs they go like this. hey work some arms i go. like this no johnny. uh from uh that book. of power show or whatever. he saw me at the gym. and he was like hey work out. some arms and i go like this. strictly legs all day he says. let's work out together. i go sure you do legs. though dude my trunk. is gonna be so crazy. there's gonna be [ __ ] pirates booty. in it anyway dude. i talk about working out. a lot that was that but i had a crazy. leg day i'm so sore dude. and uh the thing about working. out your bottom half is your top. half get shredded too whoopsie. daisy right but you work out. your top half your bottom half doesn't get. shredded so it's like sasha palacey. today at arawan and he goes. like this what's going on. and i'm like dude i'm getting beefed up. and he says how do i do that. i said you gotta go. to the war we gotta go. to gym every day. and he's like damn and i go hey dude what do you want. from me he went to. everyone to get those two. little [ __ ] ass [ __ ] things that they trick. us into getting to. make it seem like an immunity boost you know. and him holding those things he looked like a [ __ ] giant. dude he just can't walk into. everyone with two little [ __ ] ass bottles. love that guy um yeah so so that's that's so that's kind of what's been going. on with me my son's the wacky inflatable tube. guy and then also i had a killer leg. day um sup. with uh [ __ ] jamie foxx huh. you did they just wanna. they don't give a [ __ ] what he meant. right they just wanted to. be like oh you see he he's it's because of him. that the holocaust happened right. why can't dude this. is the you know what. i wish it was when he said when when when jamie foxx. so here's what happened. jimmy fox says if they kill. jesus what do you think they'll. do to you fake friends. now everybody who isn't super sensitive would be like oh yeah. he's talking about untrustworthy people. i didn't even think of the thing. but then people really said to. people were like wait he's talking about. the jews because people think the jews killed jesus. and all that [ __ ] even though jesus isn't real and uh kidding kidding. he might be i have no idea. dude i'm not the endall beall. of what happened in like the 1800s. or whenever it was and so um i'm kidding. dude there's so many people named jesus. and in mexico they're jesus. so um anyway he's so he made a post about fake. friends which is something jamie. foxx would absolutely do okay. that's what people do when they're jamie. foxx all right they make posts about fake. friends especially after what went down. with him like you know. he's got people thought he had ms and [ __ ] and now he makes supports about fake friends so people go oh dude he's talking about jews. you know some jews are saying. it some other people who aren't you. you don't say that. about jews during times like these with so much. antisemitic stuff going on and jimmy. fact fox is all hey hey what i didn't. mean that and that should be the end. of that but people say. doesn't matter you did. it and this is how we took it. and yes you did mean. it and now with antisemitism running. rampant you need to. be held accountable for it. cut ties with jamie foxx. and it's all okay but he didn't mean. it plus now black people are saying it's black culture. to say they they meaning the people. that keep us down that. want to oppress us or whatever. or backstab us or whatever the hell it. is my thing is i wish it. was dj khaled i wish it. was dj khaled and not jimmy. fox that did this because he's been saying they don't want us to. succeed they don't want us. so we they don't want us. to get shrimp so we get some shrimp and jamie. and and for me like they the ones. that killed jesus and for people to. be like that's antisemitic. be like you couldn't do it. the dj khaled you know. and jamie foxx put out. an apology dude you got it. they probably pressured it. into him the producers of we clone tyrone pressured him. into it dude. the producer of let's meet shazam. or whatever his [ __ ] jerky game. show is pretty they [ __ ] dude. beat shazam right let's meet shazam. wow an 80s sitcom beat. shazam that's what it's called. his his game show. man you better call. tyrone call him but you can't use my phone. so dick what's her. name erykah badu dude. and people are just like she's [ __ ] absolutely unbelievable. the artistic integrity and then she's all just like you better. call tyrone so basic. call him but you can't. use my phone now basically and then rude. to be honest [ __ ] you that's my phone hands up take your dirty mitts off. my phone it's mines but yeah dude jamie fox. isn't antisemitic and that's very obvious. i'm sick and tired of this. [ __ ] but you know that's where we're at and it's fine. and it's fine and it's it's fine. okay um i don't know man. apologizing because i don't say this. a lot but apologizing at this. point it's [ __ ] weak sauce dude. i hate that so much. um how about they got lizzo dude. though lizzo [ __ ] is unbelievable oh dude lizzo called you fat oh yeah that shouldn't bother you just point your eyes in the direction where the words coming from you'll feel fine about it i mean for [ __ ] sake that's like calling steve buscemi ugly hey just point your eyes in the direction that the words are coming from you'll be all right who said that oh you you think i'm oh i'm fine hey also dude and you know did dude she pressured me into. she pressed she that's the thing she pressured me. into touching a banana that's coming out. of another lady's vagina. hey i'm i'm good now that. you should i'm good nah. but you should hey i'm out of here. oh yeah well you're fat. oh you're gonna hear from my lawyers. dude here's what you say. when lizzo says you're fat. you go like this you're fat. also here's the thing they were in a party. environment and they put a banana in the ladies. vagina or whatever which i don't. condone no fruit goes anywhere. except in the mouth i feel like right. unless honestly if you think you can get a watermelon up. your anus then okay straight up i want to. see it i want to. see it go down. just put it in your angels then. burp up the seeds eight a million dollars. and [ __ ] at four million quarters. who's the rapper that said that. like it's hard but also why um eight. a million dollars and [ __ ] it for a million quarters. he's just said [ __ ] the bank really are you did you type it in who is it. you know okay anyway uh they were having a party. they stuck some bananas up. some uchi wally and they say hey you know. touch a banana hey hey you should do. it no okay oh hey ah and then you know. it turned into. what's up we're all fat. [ __ ] you fat huh. [ __ ] and she's like yeah okay you know it's just like you made me touch the banana. in the oochi wally and then you're talking about my weight. and you're you're not it's not like you've seen. a treadmill very you know. recently so it's like oh and then some ambulance. chasers came through and was like hold. on they did what and you worked. for her so hold on that's workplace. harassment and it's like dude. come on we're all gonna be dead. in 20 years anyway. there's aliens think about. how in 2000 if alien if the if the if congress was like yo. there's aliens we would. have stayed indoors for seven years. and now people are like uh hey there's aliens. and then someone else is like yeah. but lizzo called me fat. and and jamie foxx hates. jews and you go hmm. good point it is so. crazy dude so guess what dude. nama lizzo fan i [ __ ] love lizzo dude don't know one of her songs what's the one that goes i'm that [ __ ] i'm 100 that [ __ ] i stick a banana in your uchi wally um so yeah dude it's like they're really coming for the black people man now it's like lizzo and jamie foxx this is the thing about the woke they just they don't they don't give up they don't give this is why it doesn't pay to. be woke lizzo was woke as [ __ ] with all the what's her thing called big girls or whatever with no eye big girls did she has a show called big girls and people are like oh you know it's great she's given you know plus size women which is like you know i mean chances of dancing or what i don't know what they do they dance it's just too it's all good it's too much but it's all good but it's too much but it's all good right but the aliens are good we're gonna be dead what 20 years is good you give us 20 years i'm just like you give us 20 year. i don't think so i don't know about uh but whatever it is. what it is um and i feel like what was the [ __ ] thing see that's the thing. is too much sensationalism. because of uh how uh elon musk and what's his name's gonna maybe fight zuckerberg put a thing out on threads. where he was like i like how they just like they don't respond. to each other on each other's platform. on they like he'll zuckerberg was a screenshot. and then put it on threads. he's like nah this one. um and he put it uh elon musk. said i'm training for the fight. i don't have time to. work out um but i'm gonna that's why i brought my weights. with the to the gym. or to the to. my workplace okay fine but then also um and then zuckerberg was like i i suggested. august 26th um but i haven't. heard from him so i'm not holding. my breath zuckerberg is in it. zuckerberg's gonna win this thing. and i hope when he submits him. he goes facebook boom. smashes his head this. one's for threads oh and this. one's for facebook. oh and this one's for meta. ah um so i don't think that's gonna i don't know. if that fight's gonna happen. i think if it was up. to honestly zuckerberg it would happen but i think that elon musk. it's like just be the bruce wayne. that you are don't lose. this fight right. both guys i guess stand. to gain something from this. even if they do lose. but it's like i feel like elon's dick. is too big to. do this because what if people realize it's shorter. um speaking of fights though that [ __ ] jake paul nate diaz fight for some reason my wife is like all about these fights. i didn't even i i knew. it was common because of social media. and [ __ ] and i followed jake and logan but like uh my wife was just like let's go downstairs and watch the fight and i was watching peewee herman with calvin and i was like uh i don't i want to. watch this with him you know and she was like okay i'm gonna go down. and watch it and i was like okay. so she did it we watched. an episode of peter herman the apple. calvin the bad and i went down. another uh um we usually to. be honest we usually both. put him to. bed if we're home if i'm home. i should say and then we there. if i do one night she'll do another night. um but like she did last night. it's very even i hate when i'm out. of town though and i don't get to. do it i facetime. a lot whatever i digress. so um i went down. the thing and and she was like man. jake paul has been really. like punching him a lot. in the beginning i was like oh yeah. diaz is crazy though like he has crazy. stamina but he isn't a boxer so whatever. and um and the last round. it was like getting heavy and [ __ ] christians nowhere. to be seen him. like where the [ __ ] are you going she's like i can't watch it. i'm like dude i didn't even want to. watch this [ __ ] and now i'm watching you're not not that i didn't want to. watch it it was fun to. watch it but uh nate diaz. was uh uh i don't know man. if that was i know they say they want. to do mma which is crazy. because that's the whole thing. the whole thing about what nick. dia nate diaz says was about how like yeah. he may be in boxing. but it doesn't mean. he can fight which is so true. dude that's not fighting it. really isn't the more and more i watch boxing. that's not fight that's not fighting. it's boxing it's a sport. it's a complete sport. and ufc is absolutely fighting. what's the [ __ ] uh what nick diaz diaz interview this. is what i wanted to. watch that nick they got nick. diaz nick diaz's brother on um no nick diaz um that was pretty wild come. on come on i i can't. find the video guys sorry. i can't find the video but he was absolutely. on [ __ ] zooted dude he was just zooted he was like ah i i wanna i'll fight. logan the only thing that makes sense. i fight logan and nate diaz. is a huge star nick. diaz is a star in the ufc community. but nate diaz transcends the uh the thing. so i don't know if i don't know if they're gonna get that. fight going on it's all about entertainment. anyway but whatever it's not boxing it's entertainment. right it's gonna agree on that. but maybe i mean i i'm not to. take anything away from jake paul i think jake paul has been really put in the work and he looks like a good boxer. although that's me coming from from become. a comedian from become a comedian. from a comedian i mean. you know foghorn leghorn. um so that's what's up. i think it's great that. uh gucci mane is coming out. with a [ __ ] show um an album called woppenheimer you know what the [ __ ] is [ __ ] anyway is that a thing that that rappers do oppenheimer like what is this oppenheimer um gucci mane on wappenheimer out now oh it's out now dude hell yeah dude shouldn't it be guapenheimer because that means like money dude hmm i'm uh not and i'm not really good at hiphopping though so here we go dude this is the video i saw and this is insane dude a demon came with his penis uh uh gonna start it over dude gonna start it over demon came with his penis. so descriptive here we go. a demon came with his penis. and put it in my mouth. dude you know i mean. it sounds like something a demon. would do that's that's true. and and then he tried he came again. and he slept with me. last week that just keeps sleeping. around you know it was a demon. and then he came again. and since then my private part has been itching. did it roar as herpes. dude did it rose chlamydia. did it rose gonorrhea dude. wasn't a demon was. derek um okay hit her. in the head wow so assault. dude i know how to. make this assault better mara. salt who are you who are you. this sucks dude honestly people are so it's so fake. and you can tell it's fake. and even she is like when she's going. in her head she's like i hope this. is real because something needs. to work a demon came inside. that might came in a demon. came in with his penis. now he's spraying her oochi wally through her. jess uh some white stuff. came out dude the dog the dog. the meme of the dog like this. some white stuff came out. when i went to. the bathroom 15 minutes later he. got gonorrhea dude. you got gonorrhea from derek. wasn't a demon dude. was derek after i spray. with the water after i spray. with the water dude absolutely bonkers. insane rob hayes sent me that shout out to. rob hay on the uh on the patreon. but yeah dude a demon that's i don't know man. some women would brag about. that dude you know i got babadook. in the bed you know. i got babadook don't you. don't you know i got babadook. so my back hurts that's great. dude that's great how my back. hurts dude all right. took a little peepee break. man this megan rapinoe rupino. not rapino rapino sounds right. because it's uh sounds italian. megan hello i am dude. she is david spade. um he so she lost. so she makes a big thing about super being uh super woke. and [ __ ] she's got teal hair and um bro she she didn't make her penalty kick dude. leave her alone first of all. you know but that's the thing. about people are just like you know. she misses a penalty kick and now everyone's like it. doesn't even go from like oh dude. you ruined it they. just go die slow. [ __ ] you know and that's crazy. so it's like uh leave her alone. but that's what happens. when you [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] and you're really annoying. dude and then that happens. you know i don't know and then trump is just on immediately. you know he's immediately on one. because she said she would not go. to the thing she would not go. to the white house. if she was invited right. or there was an open invitation. or something um who once refused to. visit the trump white. house yeah okay and um so she did this. she missed the paint the the field. the field goal or whatever they lost. to sweden by the way. which is that are they even good. um i don't feel like sweden. swedish people can play soccer well you know because they don't have to. because their life is so dope. the [ __ ] swedish people is awesome. by the way dude are are there just like white people. in sweden or what it's like. pretty white and blonde right. i mean that's what it's known. as look i'm tired of hearing. that honestly america is america. is racist because we're letting everybody. in that's why it's hard. to be with people anyway. any difference dude you see a short. white dude and he's in the way. you're like hey short [ __ ] move you know what i mean. it's all about what they look. like hey hey a big guy ff [ __ ] hey two steps. to the side can you do that. without having a [ __ ] cardiac arrest. that's what happens you look. at the differences so if it's a black guy or an asian all. of a sudden you do [ __ ] that's going to. lead to stop asian hate but my point. is america's not even really the racist. country dude we're letting everybody in the racist. countries are the [ __ ] like sweden. dude they're the people that are just white. bring them out invite the black people invite the asians. but you won't though. right you know how hard it is to. get a [ __ ] uh uh what do you call it. a um uh uh uh visa over there. for black or asian dude. because they're like no no. we actually don't want them. we we feel good for them. and we want them. to be happy but we are all. full at this point. we have no vacancy yeah. treat us like la quinta inn. okay we cannot have this. here we are a radisson. basically you don't have a very dude. so i'm tired of hearing the [ __ ] america's built. on racism well at a minute. at least we're awesome dude. yeah you know there are race. wars but still we're letting them. in let's figure it out. so they lost to. sweden which is i can't. imagine you're good at soccer. dude countries that are good at soccer. are are poor as [ __ ] countries that only have soccer. they got like [ __ ] christmas is like a winter wonderland. in sweden they have money. you know but you you know. colombia and you know. cuba and like [ __ ] the one with the e. and then venezuela those places. have to be good because they're like you. know the only thing i had when i was young. was this bowl and now i am able. to live in the life. of luxury right all i have in this. world is my ball [laughter]. i haven't all i haven't like the [ __ ] so uh donald trump was just like he goes like this onto. on x i guess it's called. now god that's so [ __ ] annoying the loss was fully emblematic of what is happening. to our once great. nation under crooked joe biden you. know he wrote on a social media. platform oh his social media. platform does he have one. now or did he use twitter. that's a twitter many oh this. is truth social is that. so they so he didn't use. twitter anymore or he does. he does not oh wow. oh wow okay he's unblocked but still doesn't use it. many of our players were openly hostile. to america no other country. behaved in such a manner or even. close i love that so trump. to be like or even close. he added woke equals. failure nice shot megan the. usa is going to. hell uh maga dude. going to hell imagine. if you missed the penalty. kick and and the devil. was just like that's enough and they just bring usa down. with them the blue haired. woke woman lost well actually is she woman. i don't know how she identifies but she missed. the penalty kick so uh yeah. i'm annoying one fire told me. he was rapping now. and not rapino because that's ridiculous but and so i said it. rapping oh but i know. it's rapino so it's all. good yeah i know it's okay. um everything's crazy but it's okay dude. honestly i'm gonna be totally true. because wayne brady came out as pansexual. so that's cool i love wayne. brady dude and he's pansexual. now a lot of people are confused. what pansexual means what pansexual. means is you're not attracted. to gender you're just attracted to. a person and if you love them. you'll [ __ ] blast them right. you'll blast them so it. doesn't matter a lot. of people like well that's bi because you just you'll blast. whoever and he's like no pansexuals. were like no it doesn't matter. if they're male or female. or anywhere in between if i love them. i love them and that's when i'll do the blasted. that's when i'll absolutely cream. inside of them right. it doesn't matter what they are okay. but it's kind of bi in a way. but it's pan all right. well you call tomatoes tomatoes whatever you want. if i'm in love with them. i'm doing blasting inside. that's what i'm doing okay. male or female secondary love him. blasting right so uh. wayne brady came out. as pansexual and uh you know but he's been married. forever so he's never really blasted inside. anyone except his wife which is cool. so can you really say yeah. you can be totally you can be gay. if you didn't blast in dudes. right it's all up in here isn't it. i want to. blast dudes but i don't blast. dudes i'm gay i blast dudes. but i didn't wanna i'm not gay. not crazy but if you're still doing. gay stuff right you're doing gay. activities right so while you're doing good. activities if you're not gay. so maybe there's some stuff in there. that maybe leads to. points to the gayness which is. fine and i'm not saying wayne. brady i'm just saying someone who's gay um so congrats. to wayne brady for coming. out as pansexual you know i'm just gonna i'm my own sexual. my own sexual that's what i am. i'm my own sexual and that's what i do. and what is it it's pretty. much heterosexual oh okay. um cool sounds good but it's my thing. so it's my own sexual um mind. sexual idaho people told me that movie's. good never watched it. never wanted to didn't care. it won't won't watch it. dude when that came out everyone. was all talking about it. that was the first time. ever was like this did everyone talk. about this too much. i'm not going to. see it dude he's himself. um that's what that chick. that was in some stuff and then never in any other things. he probably just had a family. and [ __ ] she's a huge trump supporter. you know dude it's so uh i'll tell you what dude. man my younger self just learned. i learned that natalie portman's. single now my younger self. goes like this damn dude. natalie portman she's crushed. shitty dude love natalie portman and. she uh is getting a divorce. which sucks dude i hate when people break. up really hate it. and they're breaking up and i think it's rumored to. be that the husband cheated and then it's like oh okay. well that's you know you know. it sucks and then you learn. he's french and you go. like this well it's not cheating if he's french you know i mean like french dudes you gotta know that's in their blood right they say they don't even they don't even count it. as cheating because there's doesn't have a love involved. but of course you know. did you [ __ ] another woman what but what about our vows. and that it does not. have anything to. do with this that is uh something else but did you cheat. no no why not because i only love you. but why did you stick. your dick in a woman. it was plenty it wasn't just one. but of course but french jews. just do it french french dudes. chi at brunch you know. like they can't it's unfair. to tell a french dude. yo you know you can't. he would they would literally shame you. on twitter until you committed. suicide um but yeah natalie portman is single and the french guy did the french [ __ ] you know honestly getting mad at a french guy for cheating is like getting mad at a a [ __ ] for being short or not being able to. reach the peas um i guess you can't say [ __ ] but it's okay it's fine uh benjamin. millipede oh yeah an affair. that's what that's what us. says us isn't [ __ ] reports dog [ __ ] stuff so who knows uh uh it's crazy that natalie portman is 42. wow. rumor swirled that millipede was having an affair with camille etienne a climate activist well i'll tell you something right now do not have an affair with a climate activist that shit's gonna just go up in flames wow and i'll tell you what they'll never blame camille atene the climate activist let's see who she is camille etanae 25 year old climate activist huh imagine being a climate activist imagine being a for real climate activist that's what you're known. as that's crazy dude people using hairspray. like no no hey hey those on um oh dude. everyone's talking about this [ __ ] fight that happened. with the uh boat and the um uh and the uh were the boats. trying to dock and the and the white guys are not moving. the boat you see. this the white guys are not moving. the boat and the black. guy's like hey you gotta move. the boat we got a huge. [ __ ] it was like a huge uh what do you call them. like ship not ship but like a big thing and he's like i'm supposed. to be parking. here or whatever they do. docking here and the white. guys are like nah and then the black guy. is and the white the black guy. and the white guy. that come up to. each other and the white guy. swings up on him and and then the black guy starts. fighting back and then and then it's all. i have heard about for the past. two days and then i'm like all right. i'll watch it i watch it. it's not that [ __ ] big of a deal. dude it's like what white guys. were on a boat and then black guys. were on the other boat. and then the black guys came to. defend the other black guy. and people are making it like it's racing. it probably it's probably a little i don't. know if it is this. one goes back to. what i was saying dude. people just don't like differences if you're fighting. a guy who looks different. in your head you're like [ __ ] this [ __ ] whatever he is ah come on you fat [ __ ] you know so all of a sudden i'm fighting a black guy i'm racist that's how it's going in my head all of a sudden i'm doing asian i'm fighting an asian guy i'm like all right that's cool. but it's too bad we're not in a driving. competition you know i would [ __ ] kill. it and and in my head. i'm doing that right i'm not saying it. out loud in the fight because that would be racist. but in my head i'm practically. in a retirement community in [ __ ] west palm. beach that's how racist. i am do you know. because like i'm not i don't care if you're what that's how unracist. i am i don't care what. color creed religion [ __ ] or not you are whatever you are i'm gonna be mad at that and use that that i that's why i hate you did it say what i'm saying it's backward logic in a way but it's not in a way because i will hate you equally as i will for somebody in a different minority or shortness or fatness if i'm fighting you and that's the reason why my hate is gonna kick driving the mach 11 right because you know ah yeah too bad you didn't put down some of the pizzas you might have been a [ __ ] a little bit better. with it pop right. i don't hate fat. people but right now i do right. and that's across the board. for everyone dude and if you act like it's not that. it dude i'm in line. someone cuts in and it's a [ __ ] short guy right where's your dad buddy that's me because you cut in line and i'm using what i see that's the difference between us right a bald guy gets in line hey bud this ain't the line for [ __ ] toupees right because i look at what the difference is between us [laughter] so now a black guy comes or now an asian guy comes in oh [ __ ] he's racist but really that's just the difference between us is that i can't be blindfolded with dental floss and it's so stupid stupid dude i'm a [ __ ] [ __ ] i don't you know because guess what if you don't say anything silence is violence. too so i'm right. here in line and you cut in front of me. and whatever you are that's who i hate now. so i saw that [ __ ] boat thing. and it was just like it. was okay man but the commentary. from the the the the the the people who filmed. it the black people the people who filmed. it that happened to. be black the commentary was. just way way better you know. i mean way better uh there's a black lady. who did it you know. what

look he'd even look dude that's unbelievable he didn't even look he was throwing haymakers and connected that's not fair it doesn't count doesn't count redo redo dude they fought what is this they felt like they were hockey players bro let me tell you something have you ever met a hockey player have you ever met a [ __ ] hockey player dude they are so tough it's unbelievable i can't even believe when you shake their hands it's like shaking a tree and they've gotten so many fights dude and their balance is [ __ ] amazing you know that's why they're so good at fighting i see guys at the gym on that bosu ball. you know doing like one onehanded. [ __ ] deadlifts or single leg deadlifts and i'm just like yeah you're working on your balance you could probably fight good i need to. get on that [ __ ] i need to. start doing them deadlifts with one leg. but it hurts my hips kinda wow. this is really adult. this is really devolved honestly. um from the boat fights. to that but i just feel like uh hockey players. are so dope and they're cool. and they're also sexy and that bothers me. because hockey players are [ __ ] they work. out all the time. and they're so good with their legs. and i'm so jealous. of their legs and they can fight on ice. which is crazy if you think about it. and my wife probably likes them. and even when they get older. is it good to. date an athlete and marry. an athlete because most of let's just take it. at face value athletes are really good at what they do. and their top they're good. for like i guess breeding. and [ __ ] like you know mark mcguire his kid. will probably be good at [ __ ] running. especially with that ass that. mcguire's got a [ __ ] dump truck right. i dress it up real. nice i wouldn't do anything. to it i just dress. it up real nice. and take pictures of it. but um yeah mcguire's got like a dump truck. which is great but then it's like most ball. players are [ __ ] idiots you know and i don't mean ball players only i mean mostly athletes are just idiots. you know generally uh but it doesn't mean. that they're all idiots some of them. are very smart okay. but the focus is on chasing a ball. so you don't really get smarter. doing that unless you're also reading. or having great indepth conversations. which you're not because you're hanging out mostly. with other guys who are chasing a ball. all right or catching a ball. you know so it's like you know these chicks and stuff. they like are like yeah athletes are hot. and they are hot and they might you know blast you into. oblivion but you better just get. knocked up and then steal their money. right because for the long. run i'm not sure you want to. be with an athlete. now that's not saying you want. to be with a [ __ ] right you're not interested. in kirk behavior you're not interested. in the like a guy that would be in a [ __ ] tmobile commercial. do you know what i'm talking. about you're not interested. in a guy that would be really an adding commercial. honestly because the people who are in commercials. are straight up mister keeps it. dry you know what i mean. like they're just ridiculous they look. ridiculous dude guys in commercial are just [ __ ] they should all be billed as mr keeps it dry because that's just they're just so [ __ ] you know and like they're in like an argyle sweater and like some black wire rim glasses and [ __ ] and they're like can i help you can i help you with your mobile plan and you're just like dude what it up man i can't why because i'm phil keeps it dry you know what i'm talking about so it's like you want the guy in between right you want the guy in between you don't want a rock star because they do a lot of drugs i'm just saying you don't want a banker because they do hella coke right they can't stop doing coke the amount of time a banker the amount of times a [ __ ] banker or a broker goes like this what's up and you see [ __ ] white cake under their nose is it's honestly 35 of the time when a banker says what's up that they have white cake under their nose so it's like who do you go for right and i think that deep down women do really respect loyalty and that's the number one thing they want even though bags and [ __ ] are so dope and shoes but a woman really wants loyalty right so it's like who's loyal not dumb won't spend hella money on bolivian marching powder and will be a good family man but needs to. make some money so it's like you can't. go school teacher because they make [ __ ] chips they make nothing who's that leave you got to. get like a guy who owns a business. that's what you got to. have you got to. get like a guy who owns a business. but not a business that's too. successful like if you date. the ceo of kaiser permanente that guy's got crazy. demons he won't stop building you know you got to. get a guy who is like the ceo. of a sandwich place. that has like three places. locally you know and he's got like we make a lot. of money but there's also a lot. we've got to. pay a lot of guys you know. so it's like i'm always trying to. figure it out that guy's the best. guy all right i'm glad i figured it out. for you i'm the dating. guru i'm like i'm a hitch. that stupid [ __ ] movie with will smith um anyway dude i'm glad to. be there for you because i'm hitch. but yeah dude it's crazy. you want something crazy. but you also don't want the crazy. thing you know god really. [ __ ] us on that god really [ __ ] us on that didn't they because like we we want stability but we also our midbrains are activated. when you see a [ __ ] red lamborghini. not red that's not my thing. but if the shit's the color. of throw up holy [ __ ] i need that you know if i see a lamborghini the color. of throw up i'm basically a komodo dragon. like i need to. [ __ ] get in that car my midbrain activated. like i'm one of the [ __ ] avengers like i'm in fight. mode i need to. get in that [ __ ] car right but also i know that that's i can't put two [ __ ] car seats in the back. of that they don't even. have two seats in the back. so i'm like all of a sudden the lambo the color. throw up that's out the door. but i still want it. but it's like okay i'm not gonna be mr. keeps the drive with a [ __ ] minivan so i get the audi rsq8. i guess but then it's like can we tint. the windows and my wife's like i can't see out the windows. if we did it and i'm like what if we do a lower grade. than we did with the [ __ ] bloody guts. mercedes and she's like i don't really want to. so i'm like all right. life's all about balance. my babies i guess that's what it. is and you know you won't want. to go to minivan but you don't want. to go to activate the midbrain. too heavy because then it's like you might as well. be a [ __ ] komodo dragon. with poisonous saliva you know. it's not even the poisonous saliva. it's the bacteria in it. that gets all in your cut and then you get a [ __ ] potato. lag and [ __ ] so it's like okay. either way dude i love you guys. and i really appreciate you. go on stop by the crystalia. store and get some merch. and i'll be in charlotte. and knoxville and little rock arkansas. and nashville and canada. so go to chrisley dot com. to get them tickets. like and subscribe you know. we'd love it if you leave. a comment uh and we'd love it. if you [ __ ] make sure you're subscribed because a lot of times they've you know the man. messes with us right. they really mess with us. and i don't mean jews just by just because i said they right. i just mean whoever i mean. people i mean the man. that's what i mean so um i appreciate you. and then also uh subscribe. and then uh i'll see you on the road. uh uh also we'd love it. if you sign up. on the patreon patreon dot com. crystalia get every um we have like 33. episodes there that are not available to. the public and that's just six bucks. you get those and you get to. chat with us on the discord. and uh you know you send us. videos we talk about them. on the podcast like rod. hay did today shout out to. rob hey so i appreciate you. guys thanks guys [music].
