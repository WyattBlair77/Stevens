stuff. down in the podcast and it's one. word and i have no [ __ ] idea but i love how i also love how the i love how the i don't know what that. means i love how the disinfectant thing. that trump said was just insane. dude and now he's trying. to act like it was sarcasm which is the best. disinfectant trump dude the guy's such a goofball and he says i was sarcastic. and he's just like and it's just a sit not sarcastic. dude dude dude cool it's so cool. to say dude did you know that. instead of dude now this is one. of those youtube videos. let's check this out this. is one of those youtube. videos that when i check it. it won't it'll i'll have it. and it won't have the [ __ ] actual youtube video it'll have somebody talking about the eww. happy talk and the government who's this. guy to protect us with testing. he turned his attention. with this a magic pill. he matt you know that. committee i couldn't look more like he sounds and that guy. who the white house. is scrambling to. mitigate present from suggestion that injecting or consuming something that should not be consumed or injected. under any circumstances wow chris hayes points. out is a part of pattern which was a magic bullet. to save him and so chris. hayes is the guy chris hayes looks like the guy who brings one. piece of candy and eats it. in front of the class. and everyone's like is there's any for anyone. else and he goes and he secretly thinks that your mom. you know your mom's don't. love you but when trump says the thing. about [ __ ] it would make the economy. and the stock market come risk i wanna obviously dissing from saying this i don't want to. violate or dealing with supposing we hit the body. with a tremendous whether it's ultraviolet. or just very powerful light. and i think you said that. hasn't been checked but you're gonna test. it and then i said supposing you've got the light inside. the bottle of what if you can do either. through the skin or in some other way. and i think you said you're gonna test. that too then i see the disinfectant. knocks it out in a minute. one minute and is there. a way we can do. something like that she's not. even answering that's an aside the knowledge the cleaning. because you see it gets in the lungs. and it does a tremendous number will also be interesting. to check that oh yeah be very interesting. it would actually be very interesting. to check that it would be so [ __ ] interesting to. inject somebody with [ __ ] lysol but you know what let's not do it because i can't do that because it's not medical supply and also injecting it it. would be it goes. on the lungs was my favorite. part it goes on the lungs. first of all it would go in the lungs it goes. on the lungs this guy's watched. too many [ __ ] avenger. movies we just put an ultraviolet light and yeah i know i understand. i understand what he meant. to it okay i understand. about the ultraviolet light and all the [ __ ] but guess what i'm not a scientist. also doesn't work okay i can't. wait for the comments oh dude. you just stop talking about politics. you obviously don't know what you're talking. about no [ __ ] i don't know what i'm talking. about okay but the thing. is i'm not president i'm not a [ __ ] sack of potatoes do it uh yeah and the lady with [ __ ] nine scars this lady is always looking like she just got twisted up in some curtains. and it was like [ __ ] but i'm late for the briefing and then ran and he's talking about how you can just inject the [ __ ] and like let me tell you something dude my uh what do you call it my radar for sarcasm my radar is pretty damn good you know i'm a i'm a i'm a comedian. i literally almost said i'm a computer. and if i did that i would have just left. i would have left i would have drove. out of my house. and i would have you wouldn't have [ __ ] seen me. for a long long time. alright because i would have just given up on life. i would have cried i would just listen. to that [ __ ] tim's fm devon a funny. face is shervin basis learning visas. while i was driving in it's kid. it's kinda funny [ __ ] furnace sad. for some reason i think the word funny. is in that song so many. times um but i would have been crying just mad. world mad world well well if i said computer instead of comedian. now now now boys. i'm a computer hey kiddo i'm a computer. like that [ __ ] i'll gi joe thing that went viral. but anyway i'm a comedian. i am i'm pretty good at. understanding what what a [ __ ] goddamn. sarcasm is and also a president. don't be sarcastic number one. job shouldn't be sarcastic fireman number two president. okay get out the building's. burning oh my god really psych. does is the same. thing if you're the [ __ ] president. inject lysol oh you were kiddin well eighteen people [ __ ] died from doing it cuz you're the leader of the free world anyway i shouldn't have done it why can't he just be like i don't know what i was talking about i didn't mean to. say it that way i know how it came off oops. why it doesn't he just. do that why doesn't he just do that. everyone would be like oh alright well yeah that was a goof. whatever but he's like well it. can't be wrong so i was gonna i was sarcastic. [ __ ] sarcastic dude also he didn't do the jerkoff motion you know he should have done that if he was being sarcastic yeah yeah inject lysol in your veins or went went. anyway biden got endorsed by hillary. clinton which is just like and he was just like i'm with her. and he retweeted it so hey biden you know let's not let's not do that. because that'll definitely make sure. that you don't you don't. you don't win you understand. what i'm saying biden with that. [ __ ] tongues would have [ __ ] at tongue swoop. that [ __ ] trump retweeted the jiff the deep. it's not a d fake i don't think but the biden. after he was talking about beef. jerky probably did that or some [ __ ] but i don't bring up. anything dude wyden he'll bring up. anything fine what are you. gonna do with the economy. yeah you ever you ever. put together a chair um yeah so say yes so he's just like i'm with her. and everyone goes like this. oh you're like hillary cool. well then you don't believe in pizza. gate you lost my vote [music]. so yeah so so i don't know but that [ __ ] thing was scary. as [ __ ] and then people and then i sent it to. the group texan nick swardson. said is that real and i go okay. i can't you know no. it's not real cuz he looks like a [ __ ] demon. but uh yeah so he was he retweeted that. and people are like up in arms dude. labels are absolutely up. in arms about this it's taking that. trump used and weaponized a deep fake the freedom. you wouldn't think that the first. person who weaponized deep fake is the president. of the united states of america. you'd imagine it would come from. a peel box that was out of out of commission but it comes from i saw something that said you'd think it would come from this place but a king from 1600. pennsylvania avenue yeah dude i understand. people are real [ __ ] dumb i understand. people are so so stupid like you can't you know that. whole inciting a riot thing. but it's like if you're real stupid. and you think that a [ __ ] that that biden thing. is real you're the first to. go bro you got to. get on the front line. and just get a rattattat. it up do to. fight for our country. and get out pat it. up so [ __ ] king jonghoon or ill king. king king kong john em king kong john. bull own kim jongil kim jong un. i don't know dude okay [ __ ] kimmy buller i don't know kim king do king king james jung. hoon ill king john king kim jongin the ming ming. ending in the beam ending king james jong hoon in the beginning. ill died okay he's dead. he just [ __ ] was doing that. north korean [ __ ] march. and just went a little bit. too high and his [ __ ] groin split. open i don't know what happened. and his balls went rolling down. the hill and he goes. oh [ __ ] you ever see someone try to. [ __ ] run after balls going down. a hill that's the most. [ __ ] you can look dude and balls rolled down a hill. guess what goodbye balls dude. i would never risk my life. trying to go get balls. [ __ ] rolling down a hill. and one time when i was on rollerblades i was. i was dude i would go fast. on rollerblades rollerblades was my [ __ ] the 90s. forget it dude i would [ __ ] boom. and i would [ __ ] boom and i would kick back. one while my [ __ ] [ __ ] sliced i would slice him up like this with my [ __ ] hand and i'd slice it up on the other hand and my [ __ ] right leg would go back when i sliced my left hand and my left leg would go back when i sliced my right hand bro i was arrow died the [ __ ] namek okay ever since the beam inking and i [ __ ] was doing this [ __ ] i saw a big hill and i was like can you take it and i was i yi up you know how everyone's two voices in your head if you say you're not you're a [ __ ] piece of [ __ ] dude you go like this to. yourself can i do it. yep if you ever think i can do it. without somebody in your head. asking you can you do it. you're a [ __ ] sociopath. for real so i go like this. can i do it and then i go. yup and then i hit that [ __ ] hill. and i was always good at being arrow. the [ __ ] dynamic but i was never good at stopping people. would do that tea stop and i will. be like how do you do dude. how do you do the tea. stop without swerving do it i would you do. the tea stop then your [ __ ] wheels. are just perpendicular and then you just end. up swinging and then you fall on your back. and your head gets hit on. the [ __ ] gravel and i didn't wear a helmet because i ain't no. mark i didn't wear a helmet cause. i know [ __ ] this was [ __ ] new jersey dude you think i'm gonna be [ __ ] slicing and kick him back with a with a with a helmet on come on man might as well be wearing shoulder pads and you know your boy got no shoulder pads i mean elbow pads shoulder pads [ __ ] be an arrow. the [ __ ] dynamic shoulder pad just shoulder pads while you're [ __ ] rollerblading anyway rollerblading is [ __ ] by the way you put on rollerskates okay they figured it out in the however whatever decade it was and then in the 90s we were like what if we make it more difficult and what if we make it so people hurt. themselves more [ __ ] that dude anyway so i went down that hill and bro i was fast and i thought oh [ __ ] i went on too fast now i'm at the point where i'm too fast i can't stop i'm gonna have to. throw my body into. something so i was looking at car. parked cars i was looking at other. you know trash cans i was like maybe. that maybe that no and it was just getting. faster it would start you know. sure and i would see things go by. [ __ ] i should have hit that one cuz now i'm just getting fatter. [music] so i was like i'm just gonna jump. on the grass and in new. jersey they got the sidewalks. and i jumped i jumped. off the gravel and onto. the [ __ ] first patch of grass. because there was always the first patch. of grass and then there. was the sidewalk and then the person's yard. i jumped off on that first patch. of grass now i was. gonna do a hop over the [ __ ] sidewalk from the first patch. of grass into. somebody's yard and i had it. all planned out in my head. and ah as we know. things don't always go to. north go to. go as planned so what i did was i jumped off on the hit the first parts. of the first part of the path. of the grass and then [ __ ] just fell down. so hard and skinned my knees. and it had a [ __ ] skin flap over. my knees because of the sidewalk. i got scraped on it. and it's all good but i'm fine. and that's my point dude. i'm never ever running. after a ball running down. a [ __ ] hill but my point. is king james in the beginning. kim jeonghoon illest [ __ ] rapper. alive is dead okay. so and i don't know why. but he had surgery and he hit dude. they gotta kill the guy. they got to kill the surgeon. there is zero choice. it's a matter of fact. it should just be an honorable. thing that you do for your country. is legit work on the leader. king jongil kim jong un's and then [ __ ] you prepare to. die whether you fix them. or not you go like this. thank you for your service. and then you go and then you just go and then you go and then you in slow. motion and it's kind of funny. [ __ ] then your friends mad world and his tears were even shooting out of his eyes. in slowmotion mad world and then they go like this. [ __ ] it let's go in the meantime. make sure there's no internet. still i [ __ ] and so yeah that's it dude. you don't you do not you. do not [ __ ] work on king kim jongil kim jong hoon. without getting [ __ ] killed so it doesn't matters for a nose. job or a heart. transplant that's it i wish it. was just for a nose. job if kim jung. hoon was going in for a [ __ ] nose job and the guy just goes like this. okay here we go. uh uh scalpel please mad world. mad world get the other guy in here too lady's dead. oh all right well we gotta [ __ ] use his sister now do you see her sister dude her sister that one pic. of her just like this dude. least kim jongun looked like a [ __ ] like a kid that would uh just like run away. with the ball you know literally and i'm you know. he was look he would chase. after the ball down the street. and also run after the ball. anybody come on dude. and he had the ball he's like [ __ ] kim's talking with that kim had the ball we can't [ __ ] use it. and it's his ball you. know no matter what we say. we don't have a ball. and it's his ball but yes so the guy that nerd. dude how nervous would you be if you were kim. jong un's [ __ ] surgeon. how nervous would you be if you were king. jong un's surgeon. just okay um one time. i went into a [ __ ] boot place. i wanted to buy boots. i was like 22 i was with my friend. brandon and this and this and this indian. guy was uh was was the salesman. and he was so nervous. and brendan and i couldn't stop laughing. i was like one of those [ __ ] high school. things actually no i was in high school. [ __ ] this 21 year old [ __ ] and he and i was like hey do you have these boots and he was like um actually um let me look and he was so nervous it was like somebody was there with a gun to. his head or a gun in the thing. and we live you know. when these kids come. in don't [ __ ] with us. man we will kill you don't. mention we're here so we came in and the guy was like let me see i'm andy. we'll go to the back. and be like i'm actually we do not have those. um we do not have those style. in we don't have your size. and then everything i asked you'd be like actually and we used. to have them and every time. i think of someone really nervous. in a situation i think of that. guy goddamn so that guy i imagine that guy as kim jong. un's surgeon just like okay we're here. he needs to. have a [ __ ] you know some stuff done but actually i'm okay we used to. have those instruments but we don't have those now. but let me see in the back. and it goes in the back. what do we have we need to. have something like that just just use a butter. knife okay i mean i feel okay. we come out we have this. yes we can do this. and then just touching it oh boy. no please doc i used. to be alive i actually i used to. be alive but i'm dead now. i'm on my way. to dying so anyway how nervous would you be if you were a [ __ ] kim jong un's surgeon. oh for [ __ ] sake dude was that the main guy that always worked on my house. stressful first of all if that was the guy. that always you is kim jong. un serge i mean i know how many surgeries he had you have never gonna lie. on suction but not because you fat. in the face so um no not cause it's not. but i guess it doesn't matter. they'll do it if i was a leader. of a whole [ __ ] country you know how fat i would be bro. i swear to. god i would be so fat. and only wear a shirt. and a short one.

[ __ ] on this podcast it's unbelievable it's a foreign language. the settlement is sealed and they're not talking about. what was in it. but we don't actually know. but it says the rumor. is that she paid 140. million on her 194 million fortune. tour x seems to. be based on reports that hey honey my before. team in dodge feldman look at these [ __ ] things i hope it. dealt these are tweets i. hope adel kills her. husband and keeps her net. worth that man didn't write any of those. songs dude this is probably from the same. type of girl that [ __ ] you know thinks if i if bryan callen divorced. his wife that she's supposed. to make half a his money. which is 20 grand [music]. [applause] [music] and then some other lady. said if i was adele. i would do something ridiculous. like go gamble and purposely lose. all my money so my exhusband can't have it. not how it works. okay still got to. pay it hopefully that person's 12. maybe it is because her [ __ ] twitter is at [ __ ] cow 666 ok cool. change it dude. what's wrong with people [ __ ] cow. 666 sit disgraceful and also mentioning the devil. uh and then this [ __ ] is the best. this this is even better. to me that man. helped build adele into. whatever star she is today. let's not just say things. because we have a mouth. ma'am like the guy who is so angry. at gettin [ __ ] at guys getting [ __ ] by having to. pay for half i don't know. what i feel about this. yeah i mean no i do actually. know what i feel about this.

[ __ ] wheel to. keep my leg propped up. and my legs still burned now. today is chest day did. i do it no am i. gonna do it after this. podcast no i'll do it. tomorrow okay even though i told my friend i go on a hike. with him now i won't cuz i'll just do chest. day and all my abs. going away slightly yes because i don't [ __ ] work out as hard as i did. when i had the trainer but i'm still keeping it. real babies i still see jake gyllenhaal. and heath ledger [ __ ] on my back. that's where they shot vast. terrain man so too hot. to handle i saw this. show too hot to. handle uh netflix you know. supposedly these hot chicks and these hot. dudes and i don't i look some of the girls. are hot i'm not gonna [ __ ] lie. okay actually hots the good. word for it maybe one. or two would maybe be classified. as beautiful but hot. okay there's one girl that i could see myself. maybe chilling with sex the horizontal. mambo sure maybe a few of them. actually chillin with one of them maybe one of them there's like two or three dudes that are okay cool kind of handsome. but some of these dudes are just [ __ ] donkeys they just like look not that good and they're just [ __ ] dummies [ __ ] and i'm watching too hot. to handle i saw about three. episodes and that's totally the type of show. that i would watch however. many episodes i watched in the first sitting is however. many episodes i'm gonna watch i'm never going. back to this show but i got three episodes. in and here's the thing. these hot people come to. an island and it's awesome. and they're all sexually promiscuous people and twelve. hours into it which i don't. know why they waited 12 hours. into it this alexa type. [ __ ] thing that looks like an air freshener is just like you win. $100,000 if you don't have sex. with each other for a month. and you can't that's a pot. of money if you guys. don't [ __ ] if you don't kiss if you don't pet heavily you won't lose. any money if you do any of this. stuff you lose some of the money. and what happens is if you kiss you'll. lose this amount of money if you you. also can't masturbate at all okay. you can't masturbate if you masturbate. you get docked money too now. what happens is that all money. that comes from the pot. i thought originally everyone gets. a hundred thousand dollars and then if they [ __ ] they lose. the money i thought that was good enough. but when you lose a hundred thousands. when you have a hundred thousand. dollars as ten people that means you have ten thousand dollars. and if somebody kisses. somebody else if you [ __ ] open the mouth. and you a little and you put that [ __ ] tongue in there you lose. three grand of the total lump sum. of the money so that means. that everyone gets docked a few hundred dollars. if somebody [ __ ] kisses so that means if you kiss you're a genuine selfish. [ __ ] all right now that being said i'd have [ __ ] everybody by [ __ ] day four and the end the dudes too because not cuz i'm gay because dude i'm on an island and this boners finding someone dylan and and then i swear to. god do it if i'm on an island. i'm always the most activated. when i get out of some water. if i get out of the shower. and get out of the pool. did i give it 30. minutes until my [ __ ] just breka quook quook quook i don't know why but it's like the roadrunner arriving somewhere boy. go go go go go quick. that's my [ __ ] my balls are like what the [ __ ] how'd we get here. so quick when i get into. the pool forget it. do it i don't know what it. is i think it's cuz my dick. is overcompensated because when you get in the pool. you dick gets smaller and your balls. get smaller because it gets [ __ ] because of the what they call shrinkage. i don't like that term. but then when you [ __ ] get out afterwards. my dicks like yeah we're gonna have a none of that. breka quook quook quook and [music]. so yeah but i would be [ __ ] everybody all the money. out the window don't give a [ __ ] but i thought the funniest thing would be cuz here's what happens when it happen. you kiss the first people. ki saw like three episodes. and somebody kissed in like the second episode. of first episode and then the next episode. is like well somebody broke the rules. the the [ __ ] whatever they call it the lady. that looks like an air. freshener the electrictype girl. is like somebody broke the rules. you get you dock 3000 and they were. like who did it and then the guys. like alright dude i'm gonna come clean. i feel bad really sorry. but i kissed and she did it. to me and the girl the hot. chick was like what you kissed. me and he did it. was his fault but that.

[ __ ] it ii want to. dance but it's not time. for dancing it's time for sleep. ease and i can't get to. sleep i try nyquil. i try [ __ ] melatonin sure it all works kind of but then what really happens. is i'm just extra tired. and there's still the jolt of electricity in my legs. so it's still hard. to fall soon and i'm talking about sometimes. three hours it takes to. fall save one time it took four hours to. go to sleep. and melatonin and night quills they don't really work. that much when you [ __ ] got to. rls because that's just like you know. spray and lice all over his [ __ ] you still smell. the [ __ ] but also you smell the terrible. [ __ ] [ __ ] lysyl out of loss one day a [ __ ] masturbator now i like talking about this [ __ ] cuz i'm a real man dude i'm a very you know i'm a you know i'm a gentleman you know i don't like talking about raunchy stuff right you know i'd like to. keep it clean i'd like to. talk about busting i. don't like to talk. about you know diarrhea. stuff i'd like to. keep it classy as well i'm trying to. say i'm a gentleman so i tried. squirting and guess what dude. not only did i fall asleep. i fell right to. sleep i was like what i do. all right [ __ ] it at a loss i'll [ __ ] squirt and i squirted and right afterwards dude right afterwards so whenever i got rls it's time to. [ __ ] do it it's time. to do that dude braham. forty i don't even want. to jerk off sometimes i'm just like nine i want. to do this [ __ ] oh my god claw [ __ ] do it [ __ ] it and then i do it and then i always conk out immediately so if you have restless leg syndrome try that for real and then three months to. look it up if other people would i thought i had like a secret i'm just like the secret guy. jerking off i'd lose so. much money on too hot. to handle it because i'd just be able. i would do i gotta fall. see like our restless leg. syndrome can i get a doctor's note. and can we not lose. money because i have to. masturbate because i have to. fall asleep it's a beautiful. island and i want to. get my beauty rest so i can go into. the [ __ ] ocean tomorrow and see yeah i need a doctor's note for too hard to. handle so i got that. rls so when i [ __ ] squirt it though i fall i fall asleep immediately and so if you have rls do that man it works and i looked it up to. see if other people were like because i thought it. was sneaky i told you and it. turns out that it was in an article of cosmopolitan in 2011 and i'm not alone. so it releases dopamine when you.
