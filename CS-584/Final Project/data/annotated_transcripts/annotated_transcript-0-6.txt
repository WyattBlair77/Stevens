do it no so um i'm like i really don't want. to travel that's the thing. about being a comedian. or being someone who travels being on tour. something like this right. and you have a family. and then you go and you do all your stuff. on the road and then your wife or husband. is like hey let's take a vacation. and you're like i'd rather. die because you you just want. to chill but when you have a family. hey hey news flesh. you can't chill cuz one of your kids. is always is falling. or crying or saying they want. to do something or wants to. go jump on a trampoline and you got to. be up and at him. i mean dude i haven't been working out. lately and i'm just like when would i even do that. if i wanted to so i'm like we got to. go to st louis. now i can't not go. oh that's that option's. not there i'll break. everyone's heart and so i'm like maybe i could just you know. traveling has become such a zone. out for me like traveling has become such a day. where it's just absolutely lonely. and sad and uh you know. it's like on in fight. club when at at the three4. into the movie. when when he's like i was just doing everything. i could just just make the time. pass and it just is like he's just doing. everything and it's so mundane. and monotonous that's that's what it's like except for i think actually. he he there's a um montage where he gets. in a plane crash so not. that but um i'm just it's so mundane. that i i'm able to. like check out now and not even. think about anything not do anything. not stress about anything i'm just in a seat. like this for either 4. hours or 3 hours. and two hours because my is my flight. is connecting so so i i'm like well you know. what i'll just zone. out i'll zone out we'll get the we'll we'll we'll fly there we got to. take a connecting flight cuz it's in colombia. missouri which is like mizou you. know the the the that's where the college. is so we got got the tickets. to go had to. connect got the baby. seats you know what i mean. it's like uh to. to drive to the airport and then got the the got to. get them on the plane. and then we connected in dallas. and then we almost missed. the connection cuz billy had to. take a nap and it's just like billy. had to take a nap. aka my wife had to. take a nap and so we almost didn't make it. and and it it was the most stressful. thing of all time yes dude it. was so stressful man way more stressful. than anything i've done in i mean. dude i was sweating. so much i was sweating. like just like some something was deeply. wrong you know just just drip when you feel the when you got your tshirt. on and you feel finally as a man. i don't know if this happens. as a woman but you finally feel it. beat up and just trickle down and you go. oh it's over [ __ ] i got to. take a shower now again. the second that bead welts up. and the second it move if you perspire. and you're just and the beads are sweat. are just chilling okay. the second they go and then you got to. go got to shower tonight. that [ __ ] sucks man i don't want to. have to shower twice. like i worked out when i was just chilling. so anyway we get to. the airbnb um finally none of the we got a car. service to get to. the airport got a car. service to get to. uh uh uh uh um colombia missouri. ordered the baby seats with the car. service zero of them came. zero baby seats so i go. all right well i'm just holding my kid. in the in the in the car like this. he's one and a half. just holding the hopeful. dude i hope that hey don't hit the brakes. too hard we're all going to. fly through the window cu i'm not. wearing my seat but if he's not wearing his i wear mine. but um so so we get to. the airbnb and it's it's fine. it's nice it's cool we got a bunch. of different families in there. you know i don't they're not my f. they are my friends. now but they're not they're not they're kristen's friends. growing up uh in college. right so not growing up. in college and i i love them. so we're there we're having a good time. and we uh go to. bed wake up friday we do. nothing then friday we go. to sleep and now this is where the fun. starts man now let me. just tell you this is where the absolute fun. starts okay you you normally. don't think about the fun. starting when you go to. bed right you go oh hm. hey maybe it'll be fun. tomorrow i got to. shut off for a little bit. which is so crazy weird. that we just shut off by. the way they should have told us before. we were born hey there's going to. be 8 hours a day. where you just completely shut. the [ __ ] off all right oh yeah where am i i don't you're there oh yeah am i i okay why cuz i just wake up. every now and then and still see myself. there but when i go and i leave to. sleep where really am i. right who knows why why. am i dreaming of [ __ ] weird. [ __ ] because of my subconscious. right right right okay okay okay all right. okay uhhuh so so i i uh i go. to sleep now we're all in the same. room my whole family is sleeping. in one room all right because there's we're all in this. house all the families. and billy just goes and billy is very quiet. when he sleeps so i'm like that's odd. he starts going oh starts. crying like what the [ __ ] maybe just cuz we're in a weird. location so i go pick him. up put him in our bed. now there's four of us in the bed. and then i'm like let's give him. a little bit of milk. maybe he's like hungry or. something give him a little bit of milk. take the milk bottle out. then he goes like this. vomit just straight up out onto. his sleep sack and i go oh we're [ __ ] whole trip's. [ __ ] there's i go there it's like a breaking it's like if this is the only time he throws up but when is when does an infant throw up once it's like you know there's so many aftershocks afterwards did you did i tell you about this about him throwing up oh dude so i go oh [ __ ] and i i say you know what i got it i'm going to. go clean i go clean he. threw up a little on me. so i'm like i go cleaning and [ __ ] so i go like this so i clean it. up and i go okay. good out to. the main room everybody's sleeping and i'm sitting there with billy. i'm like it's all good. and then he's just so uncomfortable. he starts crying again. and i go oh man. it'll be all right and i bring him. back into the bedroom and as i'm bringing him back into. the bedroom he goes like this. throws up all over the bed. so i go we're [ __ ] we're completely [ __ ] so he throw over my wife and other way calvin. goes like there did he throw up. did he throw up oh my god. oh like dude if you throw up and he throws up. i am i i i think i'm done. with life you know what i mean. like i got to. just so i'm like relax. stay in bed i got it. i put the la now i'm doing laundry. on vac i'm doing like i got like so it stinks. like utter [ __ ] i got laundry. i'm doing laundry in in the basement. of the airbnb now everyone's asleep. throwing a sleep sack in there. throwing all sorts of [ __ ] you're not even supposed. to put in the laundry. you know because because it's like they just because it got vomit. on it so like i'm like oh uh the blanket. the the the blanket that. goes over the it's not my house. too so i don't give a [ __ ] oh the blanket. the quilted blanket that goes over the thing goes in the you're not supposed to. wash this you go that goes. into the pillowcases. and the pillows [ __ ] it we got the you know what we did we dismantled the [ __ ] side drawers we put them in the washer. they're going to clunk. around real loud but we're getting them. clean and i put the baby. in there you know. just like complet i'm getting. in here we go and so now. i'm like all right i'll bring i'll bring billy. outside so i bring him. outside to the main room. okay again all right. and i go okay. two times he threw up maybe that's it. right and he goes like this. dude it's so cute. man when babies are sick it's like my heart. is bigger than it normally. is because it's so sweet. but and i want them. to be better but they're not. being better like come on babies. so he's like this he's doing this. he's doing this he's doing. this cuz he's tired. and he's like what's happening. why is the food. i'm supposed to. be [ __ ] out coming out. of my mouth huh hey cuz cuz he's now. he's old enough to. be like uh you know when you're when you're six months. old and you puke you don't. know you don't know what's you go. okay maybe that's what's kind of just. going to be happening. in this life if if you're a if you're two and you start throwing up. cuz you haven't done it. since 7 months cuz they always stop at around. 7 months cuz billy was puking. a lot until like seven. months and then he just stopped and then he just had a night. of it and i'm he's just probably like what. what what why am i [ __ ] out of my mouth. so i'm like all right. so he's so we're sitting there and he's he's now. he's it's like getting later. it's 2: 2: a.m. and i'm still out. there and he's crying he's standing up. sitting down he doesn't understand. what's going on with his insides. i'm like buddy it's okay it's okay. and i keep i keep looking. at him i'm like we're going to. get through this you're going to. do the heavy lifting. cuz you're the sick one. but i'm right here with you. until the until the finish until you get better. don't worry about i'm talking. to i'm talking to. him like it's a [ __ ] like it's remember the titans. i'm denzel washington talking to. that uh underprivileged black uh football player. and like we're connecting and i'm like you got this. you got this and he's just snotting and throwing up. and then and he just goes like this. again dude three three times yes so he threw up. three times now he's thrown up. on the rug of the airbnb. that goes in the dryer. and so now the washer. i'm washing everything dude. i don't give a [ __ ] i'm i'm washing whatever. he throws up on in the house. so now i go all right. this is this is bad. i got to put him. at least on the wooden. floor but it's cold so i put like a newspaper down and the baby. let me tell kristen and calvin are in the bed. just and billy's i'm up. here just getting thrown up. on sitting on the [ __ ] lolium kitchen. lolium floor and the wood. floor in the main room and every family's asleep. and me and billy are just trucking. it out dude and i'm so tired. but i am not falling. asleep i try to. hold them all different ways. he threw up nine times. nine times dude just picture me. in a house in columbia missouri. like not because i chose. to go just cuz i had to. otherwise suffer divorce right. so i had to. go and then my baby. who i love so much. spraying the floor dude just absolutely like he's one of those. from uh uh like one of the game. of thrones dragons just with but with puke. though and crying more and it was so brutal. so i'm like in the whole time. too i'm like tomorrow's going. to be a goddamn nightmare. because we got to. go game like holy [ __ ] holy [ __ ] you know like i'm just like all right ah jesus see this is where i think that god exists i don't start to. think god exists until this stuff. starts happening because i'm like you all right. i get it dude. yeah i unload it all on me. right now yeah it was going. to be a beautiful. weekend but unload it all on me. right now no sleep. for either of us and i'm just going. to have like you know. throw up all over me. i had it on my chest. my back and my [ __ ] and my [applause]. crack so um it throw up. in there and so um my neck. my back ew that's fine. but then in the other two ew throw up. in there ew so uh so i we got i'm like i'm and then and we were we were supposed. to take [ __ ] family pictures i'm like oh my god and i'm like all right look if she still wants to. take family pictures after all this. and subject billy to. that i'm that's fine. i'm going to go. i'm going to be positive. i'm going to do. it cuz god cuz lord wow you really got a good sense. of humor and you get me. right now aren't you and that's cool. man i understood i've had some good stuff. happen in my life so go. go ahead go ahead pour it all on me. now so she at 7:00. billy still uh no 6 o'. billy's still thrown up and and i go. in with billy and she's like i texted i canceled. the photos don't worry about the photos and i go. oh [ __ ] dude it's the little victories and then we and then she was like you can stay home with billy and go to. the game and so they were going to. they went to the game. her and calvin and guess. who also went a little bit. later because i'm a [ __ ] good dude and billy was trucking. it [music] out we went and the whole time. billy was like this and dude it was so you know what is weird. about those moments it's it's a thing. that's happening that you don't. it's it's a thing that's happening. that you don't want to. be happening you know like you don't want your kids. to throw up you don't want. them to be sick. you don't want to. you know you don't want these things to. be happening you know they're gonna and you have to. write it out and okay. whatever so i was sitting there and i this is why. i think i'm just like being a dad. is the utmost a parent. i guess is just it's the absolute. most just honorable. thing like he was just sitting there. thrown up and i i was like. i had this feeling of you. know what man and and this is the truth. and i and and sometimes when you work out. you don't want to. work out you're like yeah. but this is good for me. and i like it and you don't think about how i i i have to. work out i get to. work you got to. reframe it i get to. work out and you know. you get you get obsessed with getting a little bit bigger. muscles or you you know your fat starts. going away and that's great. but i you never actually at least for me. it's not like i want to. be at the gym. i'd rather be sucked off. right like the people who are like nah the gym. is life the rest is just details nah. some of the details is getting sucked. off so it's like okay. but let me tell you this. and this is the truth. being there with him on the floor. catching his throw up. is so my pleasure. that i i don't even know. what i i don't want it. to be happening obviously. because i don't want him to. be six but i want to. be there i want to. be there and nowh else. and i don't get the feeling like oh i got to. be there cuz i'm the one that has to. be there i i got to. be there because of i want to. be because i wouldn't want to. miss this for the world. like i wouldn't want it. to miss his first steps. like i'm here dude and i go i this. is it i'm getting. no sleep dude i'm getting no. sleep and i am riding this. [ __ ] out in columbia let's go isin. that amazing and he did the heavy. lifting but we got through it dude. and then we went to. the [ __ ] game and both went back. and sl and then i got dude. when we we we came home by the way. we had we took a southwest flight. home okay because it was the only con. only um straight shot i didn't. want to connect too. hard with the babies we got on the uh uh you know they do like a the boarding. where it's like hey let's leave. the humans with their devices. to just get on board. the way southwest uh pl. uh boards hey southwest h. assign people you know why. they're dummies we're dummies. i'll accept it hey southwest come. on you're dealing with humans. assign him a seat. dude [ __ ] first of all the lady would was ready so here we go to. southwest don't anybody try anything. don't anybody [ __ ] try anything i'm here and uh if the bags are too big we're going to. get him uh we're going step. out of line we're going to. have to get them. checked uh please uh don't do. that you can do that. you're all [ __ ] you're basically [ __ ] so here we go i'm ready i'm ready for you [ __ ] a a1 and i don't like also how like even if you get a1 you're not getting a1 a2 you're not boarding for cuz there's preboarding there's military boarding. there's baby boarding there's [ __ ] surf boarding. like there's too much. boarding you get on there. the plants half full already if you. were on c group you. might as well be holding on to. the wing so yeah just sit on. the wing and so and they're always like this. is a completely full flight. this is completely overbooked overbooked. like kiss my ass no. there nobody ever is standing in the aisle. the seats are always perfectly. full and you're [ __ ] people out of there you know what i mean you're you're [ __ ] people out of their trip by paying him $200 on a voucher or some [ __ ] and so so the lady is just we're like a7 a8 a9 right the lady's just not having it she's like arguing with multiple people before like preboarding i'm like or [ __ ] like are our bags small enough you know [ __ ] i'm not going to. do this [ __ ] we get on the plane. uh and i i'm like what do. we do i guess we'll just take a row. cuz they have a row. of like three so we'll have calvin. in the middle me and kristen and i'll hold. billy and she'll hold billy or whatever the [ __ ] and uh cuz you know under two you don't need a seat. and um we sat in a row. on the southwest flight and it was like so. the way to do. it that i couldn't believe it. it was so the way. to do it that i couldn't believe it. and then we get on the plane. i'm like this is actually. not bad dude like we got the whole. road to oursel and like kind of chilling. we got ipads and [ __ ] and then they're like all right and they literally say the pilot says or not even the pilot it. was still the lady you know. how they do sometimes. the gate stuff and then they'll come on the plane. they'll be like hey guys it's me. again go [ __ ] yourself have a good flight um so she comes back. on she's like okay so there. are um uh how many bags. was it it was that's what it. was there are 14 bags. that we told you to. check right before the plane. that you didn't check and that. are in the overhead compartment so we're going. to have to. get those off the plane and checked. uh so if you did that. do that for us please right. now uh because if you don't we're going. to have to. go through them and we're going to. find them and we will be delayed because of this. and i am dude. it's like just play by the [ __ ] sucking rules. you know what i mean. c15 or whatever. the [ __ ] it's so annoy so now we're delayed because the people are getting up and oh they got me you know she had to. she was coming down the aisle. too the one in the airport. was coming down the aisle. like man i got one. got one we got to. check it put it tag. it so uh then we take off. and the flight was [ __ ] amazing. dude i think i'm going. to take even though they got to. assigned seats dude it's so stressful. because you're like what seat. am i going to. get but southwest is uh is the way. to do it if you have an infant. under two you get the whole row. hell yeah dude sensational. um i'm not a football guy. man i'm just not you know. know i don't even know what team. they played i don't i don't uh i don't like i know i always talk. about this i try to. get into sports man. man kristen took a picture of me on the plane. where i was sleeping. with billy and i just like i'm like it looks like i have no chin. and i can't stop thinking about it. and now i think i'm ugly. yes dude yes dude i know my head was back. and i was sleeping like this. but like i'm like oh great. i'm getting that turkey thing. that old guys get on their neck. [ __ ] yeah dude 44 with the turkey i got this app that uh i paid for it it's called pick art. or something and it's just like makes it. makes people like you can i don't. know man it's like dude. what do you want it's like an app. where you [ __ ] you you upload. a picture and then the subject. of the picture you could either smos. it destroy it melt it explode. it you know inflated stuff. like that okay and i got the app and i did it. with pictures of me. and calvin was and i showed calvin. and calvin was like do me. and i did him and and and and he chose. he wanted me to. squish him so i. squished his picture of him. and then he at night he was all. [ __ ] scared dude yeah okay i know but like come on dude. it's so i had to. explain to him. that it's the computer that does. it not real life and then the next morning. he wakes up and what the [ __ ] does he say oh hey can we do it again. i'm like no you scared. you thought the dog was going. to inflate and go and and go up. into the sky because i did. it with chenzo it's not a balloon. no dog's ever done that. and then he's like no but it doesn't scare me. in the daytime only. at night and i was like well so so i said only objects. we're only doing objects so now i'm melting like you know stuffed animals. and [ __ ] and i blew up. a muffin for them. and it's just like dude. what is this world going to. be like there this [ __ ] didn't exist. when we were kids if this let me. tell you something knowing me. if this [ __ ] existed if ai existed if if you could if you could uh make it look like a picture perfect uh big metal uh uh pump is squishing a guy down breaking his bones i did that to. me and it looks just like it. and let me tell you something. if i saw that when i was five i didn't even. show that to calvin if i saw wait. i did it and he was like i don't like that. one and i was like great i [ __ ] him up for life but if i saw that when i was four dude i i'll tell you right now uh it would be jeffrey dmer john wayne. gasy chris ayah because it is that is i i i wouldn't be able. to deal with that we're so deeply. [ __ ] with this ai [ __ ] and there's nothing you can do you know it is what it is okay fine so okay it's not like i'm like no this is [ __ ] you know is it irresponsible i don't know but whatever it's going to. happen anyway so what's the use of complaining. about it don't worry twice. worry when it happens. once and so uh i i just can't like dude. you can't like trump posted. a picture of him in a steelers uniform. the other day and it just was like kind of realish and i'm just like he was but he was jacked. and i'm like all right i know it's fake but i got to. explain to calvin that like pictures. are fake now like actual pictures not just like that. that have been like printed. and and doctored but like just any picture. is fake most pictures are going. to be fake i had a dream. last night that i straight. up hung out with trump. and it was so [ __ ] fun i couldn't believe it we were in like uh either italy or oldtown montreal. i don't remember but it looked like either. of those and he was like come on come. with me and he was dressed. regular and it was just me. and him and we went into. this bar and everyone's like trump. yeah hell yeah and they were like oh your friends. with chryst they're like oh hell yeah. it felt so good i felt. so like accepted and everybody was like just happy. and i was like how do you deal. with the hate trump and he was just like [ __ ] him. man it's not real and i was like hell yeah. dude someone else was in that. dream too i don't remember. who they were it's kind of [ __ ] up how that happens. dreams will do that was i even. like where was i even was i maybe. i was there i had a lot. of crazy dreams last. night so they wanted to. play katan this weekend. you know this is me. when someone wants to. play a game thanks i'll sit this. one out and and then kristen come on it'll. be fun no thank you. i'll set this one out what are you. going to do anything. else but you'd have fun. playing the game oh i know it's not about. that what is it about it's about. that just it's too much. too much it's just too much. thank you i'll set this one. now thank you so the pling k. tan and like i i keep hearing. like i'll give you a brick. for two [ __ ] hay or whatever the hell it is and i'm watching just murder documentaries by myself so kiss me. all up and down looking for a fresh. country sound with a twist bourbon sun's latest track jump back is here stream it now. wherever you listen to. music go to. holler. christalia if you want to. purchase a shout out or a mini ad. on this podcast got this uh trump. palmer was this was great talking about just doing whatever the just what i say that. in all respect to. women and i love women. but wow that's great. and i love women just hold on. let me get this right. here okay here we go. youtube tv remember red. youtube red or whatever. arnold palmer was all man. and i say that in all due. respect to women and i love. women but this guy some guy goes this. guy this is a guy that was all. man this man was strong so getting so gay. and i refused to. say it but when he took showers. with the other pros they came out. of there they said oh my god. that's unbelievable i had to. say it i refuse. to say it he says and then says it and then says i had to. say it so broke his own. rule immediately i refused to. say it may he had a big.

then i hear the driver. the uber driver say i worked. here 44 years ago. and there wasn't even. a town here and i'm like oh my god bro. oh my god bro and i look at him. he's just got like hair coming. out of his ears and i'm just like oh my god i got more time. i got i don't have more time. i got way more and i'm old you ever. feel like that no you probably. don't because a lot of these listeners are in their 20s. and 30s you're gonna feel that. way remember i said it. remember i said it dude. and i'm not i'm not being negative. at all i want to. you know as of now. i want to. live because but because i got kids. if you didn't dude if you didn't if you're 44. and you don't what what are. you going to do. and you don't have money. you know and you're just a guy. that lives paycheck to. paycheck and what are you. doing what are you living. for and i'm not i'm not suggesting. anything but you're just somebody in no. relationship you're 56 years old. and you just like what do. what what do you do. eat it a diner what do you do. sit at home go to. work what you what do. you do you have a dog. oh good for you dude. and i'm not judging do. it if that's what you want to. do do it but my god 56. years of it cuz i'm like what the [ __ ] was i doing before. i had kids i know. people want different things and god forbid the car. footprint is [ __ ] crazy people should be having less kids right but i want to. have so many kids dude. i want to. have so many kids that it. just gets so ridiculous until it's like it's like that. vince vaugh movie where it's like. oh my god you have 300 children. you see that documentary. about that dude that just inseminated a bunch. of different women whenever he could and then just left. the country and so there's a bunch of hns all over. the place and then he and then he would go into. spur banks and just yak off. into the spur banks and then other people would have like surrogates. and he would just yak off. in them dude just yaking off. in spur banks and women. and then just absolutely having so many. just there they say like 12%. of the people on earth. are because of him because he [ __ ] yacked off in a bunch of like it's just so crazy. man so i'm like okay. that's fine but man. that's weird and then i'm thinking about like what. if actually 10% of the world. they were all mes and i wouldn't like that. dude no maybe it's because i'm too. because in a way it's it's it's uh egotistical to. make a bunch of 's and keep yaking off. in spurm banks and women. but also it's egotistical what i do. because i'm like i'm not going to. have it there's not going. to be a lot. of mes i i'm special you. get it so i'm going. to make two three four. five special not no. i don't want to. say special because it makes you sound like you know when you say a special. kid you know think you're special. that but i'm just saying and not that. there's anything wrong with that. like a lot of beautiful people do. everything but it's just like i don't know oh you just think about it. because like dinosaurs [ __ ] ruled the world. you know and just no they didn't they they're dead. they're dead so it's like ah dude. we rule the world and then it's like oh yeah what the [ __ ] going to. wipe us out if it's not ai. it's going to. be something else it's going. to be like a [ __ ] you know cross hybrid of uh you know i don't
