hawkeye um so yeah i what wolves [ __ ] let me break. down the let me [ __ ] break down this week. dude you know i got no. here's the thing i i woke. up today feeling rested. feeling good and thank god. i shot my special. let me start with this dude. i shot my special. uh saturday now i don't know. what i'm gonna call it. but i don't think i've ever had a better. taping you know just the the the comedy. all the comedy [ __ ] that. could go wrong it just kind of aligned. i was relaxed the first show. i went on my brother. directed it my first show. i went on it. was good really good i got off stage. and my agent was like that's the best. first show taping i've ever seen. and i was like really and he was like yup. and then i was like and then i was like cool. so we got to. only need pieces and when he needs. pieces he needs pieces that's all. he needs so he's relaxed. dude so your boys. relaxed now you know the whole mantra. of life rips you realize you know. what this is one. of those moments where life does. actually rep so the boy. needs pieces and he's going. onstage for the second show and he's seen his head he's like oh i only need pieces and then he gets on stage and as soon as he gets on stage dude he realizes he only needs like two pieces and that's when he [ __ ] just ripped and that's when the [ __ ] ripped and in the middle of the second show i thought hey you know what i tapped [ __ ] i tapped god on the shoulder and i go hey god guess what we don't even need that first show so that second one was the ripper man that first show was ripping but that second show was the ripper so that was just and i got offstage and i go hey we don't need that first show like i was [ __ ] the first show was great but the second show made us not need the first show so yeah it was awesome dude it was it was so awesome so happy i was so happy man had some loved ones there was just happy man my brother killed it and that's it i couldn't ask. for more so i can't wait for you. guys to see it. looks cool i had the jordan the purple. retro ones on to. help me pivot and let's see i don't know what else to. say about it but i woke. up that was the thing. i kept on like i as the days. went up to i was like i just i hope. i don't get sick. that's the only thing that would [ __ ] this up i've worked so hard to. get this [ __ ] goin to. get the material sharpest [ __ ] i did a 1011 day. run before the show i did. some casinos coupled with some theaters. and i was like don't get sick. don't get chapped lips. dude sure enough the second i got off stage. on that second show my lips. go like this and just cracked. now that's that's jesus christ. working with you that's jesus. christ just kind of it. just kind of handing you. a couple of [ __ ] of a sword a nut. of his some assorted nuts. that's what he's doing jesus. christ just handing you some a sword and assorted nuts. now can i say assorted. nuts or can i only say a sword and nuts. and now that pisses me. off that it sounds like when i'm saying. assorted nuts it sounds like i'm saying. a sword and nuts. okay but i mean assorted nuts. so that's like when you're just kind of hungry. walking through the airport you don't know. what to get and jesus. christ just walks up to. you and hands you some assorted nuts. right so that's what that. was that was jesus. christ just kind of working with you like you're in the cubicle and you type in it maybe you're in a cubicle right. now and you're like i [ __ ] i need that [ __ ] hey susan can you hand me the [ __ ] and susan just reaches over the top of the divider and hands jesus [ __ ] that's what's happening. right now that's jesus. christ's hand aeneas some assorted. nuts as soon as i got off the second. stage my lip goes and i go. doesn't matter does it. no because when my lip cracks. we know baby's my lip cracks. where it always cracks. and it's gonna you're gonna see that. on that highdef camera so i woke. up feeling good that. day and i was ready i flew from well. i guess it's a chicago. airport too because i was in new buffalo. michigan for some reason. and i went to. a job we drove to. chicago and we went to. the [ __ ] dude i got i took my tour manager. was with us cuz we were doing like at a 10. 11 day run zach danko. vo and that's how he laughs if you don't remember. and the guy is just the [ __ ] worst tour. manager of all time dude. straight up he's always the last one. for to the bus to. the sprinter van to. the airport he's like we're like i'm like what the [ __ ] is zach. and my expect i don't know. man and then he shows. up with like just he always looks like he's carrying 7 bags. even though he's only carrying like two bags. and he's just like oh i forgot. my id he's like one of those [ __ ] that doesn't keep the id. in the wallet you know those guys keep your [ __ ] id in your wallet. don't have your id. don't be the guy who comes out. and brings your id. and some cash you know i'm talking about and he'll be like

waiting for you bro. i'm gonna leave him at the [ __ ] hotel. one day i believe him at the hotel. see that telling is he's got some of my bags. sometimes so that's what's it. i'm gonna take all my bags. one night and then i get to. the sprinter van zacks not. gonna be there i'm gonna say. hey mike where's zack he's gonna be like i don't know man. he was shuffling around. in the hotel room doing some [ __ ] he oh oh oh he takes so long bro. we could be in a green. room and i'll be like let's go. downstairs to see where the [ __ ] [ __ ] is and we'll be like okay and i'll walk down the hallway and i'll look i'll do the thing where i will look behind to. the green room and he's still not out. yet dude i'm talking about you get out. of the green room and then you walk out. it's like when you leave a room. and you're waiting for somebody and you walk down. the hallway but you're still. looking at the rooms door. and he's still not there. and you're all the way. down the hallway hey. man get with it dude. always know where your ideas. to do you know. why it's your id. if there's one thing you should always have on you besides. pants have your id on you my podcast is musical. my podcast is musical that's probably why i don't like music. all that much dude. but you saw your boy. when he used the mic. when he was like dance who other what other. podcasts [ __ ] host is doing that [ __ ] that's because we are down for a silly goose time and that's it and life rips now do it i've been seeing people on instagram start podcasts talking about silly goose times talking about how life's reps talking about using my cadence and that's fine dude because people know where you got it from and it's all gravy okay but just so you know we all know and that's fine rep the cult do it whatever sometimes people use it and they're disgusting. with it sometimes people use the way. i talk and they start. talking about blumpkins or something. that we don't do that. dude we don't talk about blumpkins. here at the [ __ ] log cabin i'm a classy guy. i'm a classic man. what's that [ __ ] song no fun either tonight i'm a classic man. anyway dude we don't talk about blumpkins. man we don't talk about gross. [ __ ] you know maybe i might mention you should take some metamucil. if you're trying to. you know take some nice bowel. movements but i don't talk about blumpkins. i don't talk about [ __ ] you know [ __ ] that much and i don't i don't i would never say something like grundle you know that mean like i'm not a [ __ ] frat guy how many the guy who goes like this the guy who talks about a grundle is a guy who goes like this. when something's funny the whole man. that's classic that guy. says grundles so much. and i don't do that. [ __ ] you know how i go man. you know how i [ __ ] go all i want you know what i realized man. when i was coming up. in the [ __ ] comedy world like whatever my my brother and i we have this way of talking and it you know my friends we all have it and i was like hey i want to. do i i wish the world. knew my language now baby. i made the podcast another world most of my language. okay i did it i didn't. know i could do it. but i did it if you build it. they will come but i woke. up feeling so [ __ ] good i woke. up feeling so good three. days before my special. i woke up feeling shitty. two days before my special and the day. i am i special i woke. up feeling good now. i got a question for you. scientists why does it happen. how come sometimes you get lots. of sleep you feel good sometimes. you get lots of sleep. you feel bad sometimes you get a little sleep. you feel good sometimes you get a little sleep. you feel bad what's the deal. why do i see better. in hotel beds then i do. it in my own bed. what's the deal do i need a new mattress maybe but mattresses are thousands. of dollars so that's a little bit weird. for a [ __ ] test of something to. be a thousand two thousand. dollars how much is a mattress i don't know. i'm so [ __ ] at it i don't give a [ __ ] how much is a carton of milk. forty five dollars i'll cough on you [ __ ] too but yeah it's you know it's it is what it is man. but i had a good [ __ ] special taping. and it was awesome. and i woke up feeling so good and my buddy. mike went on before me and he was like don't whoa dude. there were no woo's on my last. special there were woo's bro. i [ __ ] hate when people go you're not at the nets. game why are you going. woo dikembe mutombo is an onstage. and yeah dude hey why go and woo. jay buhner is it out on this. field and so yeah it really pissed. me off when they go woo. and they were there. was no woo's there think there was one. rule on the second show. somebody got kicked thrown out apparently. imagine being that big of a now. so he was talking loud. i'm a manager walked out to. him he was daring. as i kinda throw someone out look and there's my out. you know i think i was like he was i was like what. happened he was like he was just being loud. okay he got up led to. the bathroom leon i suppose. dude i think him back. it was like where's my seat. us there game exists. being really alright you know so i did from out. and he was like well can i just go. back to my yeah and i was like sure. well your staff is hold. on you know and there's like where is it. it was like well look i don't know i got a wallet my id. in there you know. and i got at anyway. we've come out he's been loud. go got scary mom. so and you know it's gonna work out. you know and i knew it. nice arse like he's gonna be fine. okay but and and so he threw him. out dude he's a bulldog man. my managers good josh lieberman and somebody. tossed him out it was all good. didn't really hear it. he kind of [ __ ] he said so i think i heard something the first show. i think it might have heard him. get a little loud the first show. but how could you be that. [ __ ] he i did not egotistical but self sent her to. be like making a scene at the [ __ ] netflix special taping. anyway um yeah so laughing don't laugh. like i always say they're trying. to get rid of [ __ ] how about the lady. that was on what was it. good morning america. or no it was a british. show right how do i pull that up. where she was trying. to get rid of clapping get banning. clapping good morning. britain spacek good morning britain so basic or morning good morning why can't i [ __ ] say it dude brit ain there we go should we ban. clapping good morning. britain it's victorious the sun let's take the serious side of this first what is upsetting genuinely. about clapping okay nothing there. you go and there what is something. about clapping nothing and thank you. a word from our sponsors. that's how i should have ended right. there and then that right. here this i should've been the serious. first what is upsetting. genuinely about clapping nothing. nothing at all absolutely nothing. that's how it away. let's take the serious i wanna. do it again some annoying. what is upsetting genuinely. about clapping well absolutely nothing. [ __ ] that's funny dude. anyway so this is what is upsetting. your sobriety oh so mad. already so it's actually not just people. anxiety people who use hearing. aids coughing can be disruptive. to that it's also people who use hearing. aids clapping can be disruptive. to that people who have sensory. processing issues it can be very distressing you know overwhelming to. have those loud sudden noises but it is a great. part of our culture hey let's just go let's just so far. i agree with both of them. let's see how it derails. look at this look at how look i love when people try to. be diplomatic about about something but it's impossible to. make them not sound like it does. not feel like an idiot why. it's a bit like part. of it like the culture. right when we go to. the theater you're going to. expect to hear clapping right. now i don't mean that you're a piece. of [ __ ] when i say that but it's literally it's virtually impossible. for me to not make you. seem like a piece of [ __ ] right because i'm saying something that's so [ __ ] obvious you're not mine anyway go ahead expand on that culture or you go to. a lecture or you go. to a performance or you go. to a gig you would expect that people would clap yeah absolutely. and that could be preventing people from going. to those events. so far i agree. with both of them and we're you know 37. seconds in and and your boy. agrees with both of them. dude so this is great. man which is a real shame. so if somebody okay or not and that. could be preventing people from going. to those events. okay a group other one. which the real shame i picked the side. i booked the side. through some theatres or some universities. i took a step on over. to the other side but took a step. okay maybe i got another foot i'm like we'll see. what this other lady has to. say let's see more what this. lady has they maybe i'll call back. do you know what i'm saying. we'll see only i'm leaning over. into that foot jazz hands. instead and just like that i'm on. an escalator in a full sprint when you say jazz. hands you lose the argument it. doesn't matter if the argument is for jazz hands it. doesn't matter it doesn't matter. if the debate is called. the jazz hands debate. as soon as you say. jazz hands yellows okay let's just go back. and let me not in a rough. spot people would clap yeah. absolutely and that could be preventing people from going. to those events. which is a real shame. so if some theaters or some universities say actually we can be more inclusive. and do jazz hands instead. i hope you lovely. people could get involved and then what. would oh wow did you hear the guy. the other guy who just oh my god. that was amazing i never heard that. yet someone is stupid. okay oh gosh oh gosh. okay and dude jazz hanson. said that'd be lovely. other people could get involved. and then oh oh by oh just hurt. himself literally when she said that. she said he goes. oh oh oh oh okay it's going. to be okay i just have to. breathe i hope i die. before this actually implements not see if you clapped i don't think there's going to. be that that's great and then what would be the penalty. if you clap what if she just said tasers. tasers and we throw baloney at your face. i don't think there's gonna be a penalty frankly. i don't think anyone's going. to say like no i like how that lady. came back in and like was kind of like listen. not gonna be there okay. it's not gonna be you know. i like how that i like how she's arguing. she's arguing for the wrong. thing and we all know. we're but if you the guy came in again. but yeah of course they're not going. to persist in with clapping even though. you've been requested to. do something that's not very polite. is that like i think people understand. if you're requested to. do something in a specific context. you can do it would it. stop you and if you were somewhere and you felt the urge. to clap someone yet. they'd said we don't clap. here that guy dude. well every [ __ ] syllable he said was the same note. that guy was unreal. i'm not even talking about the [ __ ] thing anymore. the clapping and not clapping that. guy was so angry. that he was trying. to control his voice. with what and he did it. too hard the other way. it was everything was one note. one note people understand. if you're requested to. do something in a specific context. you can do it with it. i'm so mad okay let's just calm down. let's not try to. get a rise up my voice. let's be let's do this. come on nigel stop you. and if you were somewhere and you felt the urge. to clap someone yet. they'd said we don't clap. here what if you weren't. somewhere and someone put the end to. crap and then someone said we don't clap. here and then it says like you did. it no joe well they wouldn't but what we don't do. is completely restructure society. and completely change societal norms. in order to accommodate the sensibilities. of a few people it's interesting. just reading a story about this on on. the bbc news website a individual. called hannah from weymouth in dorset. does she struggles with loud. noises like clapping talk she was diagnosed. with autism and she was 23. she says i don't agree with a ban. on clapping instead let's raise. awareness of autism because this could breed resentment if other students. start to harbor bad feelings. towards autistic that's smart she's real. smart so listen okay. banning what okay i got to. minneapolis and i went into. a pub or a bar. whatever the [ __ ] it was and when i got there i had to. get something to eat it. was like 2:30 i wanted to. eat at 2:30 because i didn't want. to have to. eat right before my special. taping because i would have been on the mic. just like so anyway you know that's what happens. you just like yeah so what's the deal. with anyway so i ate at the right. time and when i was there. i was in a [ __ ] place and there was a really big local. you know football game. that was playing now did it. make me mad that it. wasn't a professional team. even yes you know but it wasn't so were they were there. old men cheering for [ __ ] you know. 19year olds on a field. throwing a ball around yes. did that make me feel like life. was hopeless yes is it. all right sure because life rips. regardless so i was there i ordered a turkey club you know how we do i like to. keep it fresh even though. that's what i i get a lot. i hadn't i got it for a long. time so i got the turkey club. and it was like this. can be the great thing. before i the meal before. my middle for my special right. so this football game. was going on people watching. it i step in i sit down i order. as soon as i start. ordering people are [ __ ] fogers and screaming. now did that make me mady. yes did i feel it in my heart. of course did my chest. tighten up yes was i trying. to do everything i could from getting. into a bad mood yes. did i somehow open the door. on the bad mood yeah. i did then did i think oh [ __ ] i don't want. to be in a bad. mood while i'm taping my special. so let's calm down now these are all. the things that are going on. in my head while these [ __ ] [ __ ] are just having a good time watching the football game. right they're screaming now i didn't did. i mention that got that. the guys screaming at the tv. also were in tail. coats and top hats. did i mention it well. they were i don't know. why were there two guys. dressed the same yeah well i guess. they were [ __ ] working for the hotel. or some other hotel. or some [ __ ] i have no idea but they were so loud screaming. at the [ __ ] team. and other people were like what the [ __ ] is going. on now i got i got mad and i was genuinely. thinking am i one of these [ __ ] people that can't stand. clapping and then i thought well no i'm not but if i was i would just stay home. or go and deal with it. people like this are just never gonna that's not gonna happen. what are they saying that. this is what they want. they're like well we think you know. people should literally it's like dirt. why don't they just get rid of their arms. you know on all honesty i think that it. would be a better society. if they get rid of their arms you know. this way they don't. have to they can't. clap right and then people can go you bend it too. far one way and but by the way this this. just made probably i don't know. how big it is 55,000 people. saw this are the good morning. britain show so out of 55,000 i would say it probably made maybe 150 people sway their vote to. trump you know so i just i mean. so [ __ ] silly and then i looked on the girls twitter and she was like well i'm getting properly dragged aren't i yeah you're getting properly dragged british. me undies hey

the thing dude you obviously heard the story where ti. was on the podcast and he says after his birthday. his daughter's birthday. he always goes to. the gynecologist and has the gynecologist check

me. i was always a huge eminem fan. i mean all that [ __ ] but mike eminem was mike's idol. and still is and so mike's like oh my god. i'm gonna [ __ ] talk about all week. so annoying i was like maybe i shouldn't have invited. you he's like i'll be fine. i'll be fine so we get there. and zach and and we get in there. and we and we show up at eminem's just sitting there like come. on it they come on in and then i walk into. the room and and sitting there and eminem stands. up and goes like this. flapping around like a babkin to. me and i'm like okay. this is the craziest [ __ ] thing already he's doing my impression to. me of him and he was like what's up. man and then we sat down. and i'm sitting on the same. couch as eminem and we're all talking. and he was like man. you killed that impression man. it was so funny he was like it. was amazing and the one in the garage where you're at where you're out. of breath that's hilarious. he's like cuz i get out of breath. sometimes i was just like it was so mindblowing. and he is let me. just say this about him. i sat with him for two hours. and in like 35 minutes. and i go i did the obligatory kind of like nice. guy like well we don't want to. take up too much. your time like so and he was the real. like now we're just chill. and hang out like all right. i said my [ __ ] piece so we were hanging out and he was talking about hip hop talking about rap. you know we can't we wanted. to obviously i i'm gonna do less. of the talking if i'm sitting with eminem i want him. to do most of the talking. and and he was just in the best. way in the best way. he was just the most normal. cool guy you know you don't know. you know these [ __ ] icons these legends you know you meet them and sometimes. they have this air where it's like. you're you're lucky to. be here dude he didn't feel. that way at i didn't. feel that way at all. and was so cool and refreshing he was just a real mature. kind of cool dude talked a lot. about
