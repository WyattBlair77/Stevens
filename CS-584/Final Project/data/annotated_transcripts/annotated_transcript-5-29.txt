[ __ ] he would just dive in he would die. he had a diving board and he would dive. into a bunch of gold coins. and and then like come up. and just spit nicked it. like nickels out and coins. out he would be dead also he was [ __ ] eighty you know if an 80 year old really duck dove. into a bunch of coins. in a vault like that. he would [ __ ] first of all he wouldn't be able. to do the backstroke like how scrooge mcduck. can do it but he would die. immediately so that's just a little bit. of your realness of your oh they did. it in family guy that's funny. where he dives in the thing. and he breaks his dude. every time i [ __ ] say something family. guy already did this [ __ ] it's cuz been on for 11. years it sucks so anyway so anyway so why even try comedy. wise you know what [ __ ] it
