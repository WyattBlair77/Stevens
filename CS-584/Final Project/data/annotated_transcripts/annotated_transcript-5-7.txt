 [music] [laughter] [music]. this episode of congratulations. is brought to. you by the cache before we even start. and i asked if people on the app. can see me or i can. hear me because i wanted. to make sure it was working and somebody wrote down on my app. loud and clear so we're good loud. and clear we are good. hmm so look you guys it's it's on babies. you know i'm saying i'm having a i'm having a good. time in life and you know. doesn't my back hurt. yes is it all good. that about my tongue yes. so does my [ __ ] face hurt. and my back hurt yes. but i am i truckin through. life yes because that's what you do. i mean you know if somebody were to. come up to. ask me on the street hey dude even though. this has happened in my life. and these are the negative. things do i still have to. truck through life i'd be like yes that's what i would do so that's what's up. man and we're already [ __ ] a minute. and a half into. this podcast can you believe it. can you honestly believe it. minute and a half in and it's flying. by congratulations that's the episode that's the episode [ __ ] [ __ ] i was i did i did a few things recently i did a ch3 podcast didn't talk about that you know i like those guys i really like those guys on h3 and i actually checked some of the comments. didn't mean to and but i was looking at. some comments and i really made me. feel good man a lot. of people online a lot. of hate and [ __ ] but a lot of people on those comments were saying like how she liked the episode how much they liked me as a guest. and that really makes me feel good. also my butthole hurts great. that's cool that's cool. and it's weird that that happened. after i did the h3 podcast. cuz we always talk about using metamucil. and i didn't use them. at a musil and because i was staying in albuquerque. and flying a lot dude. how much just flying. dry you out sahara a. sahara dude when you fly. you get so dry and i didn't i don't. even mean to. rap there but i rapped but when you fly you get so dry and you know i'm not gonna drink. coffee and coffee. does what it dehydrates you. so what happens is when you go do. number two instead of doing number two it feels. like a brinks truck. is coming out of you it's all. good but it feels. like a brinks truck. it feels like you're like hey am i going to. the bathroom or that's what i want. to do when i'm dry. when i fly and go. to albuquerque well in the desert and i'm drinking. iced americanos till. all the day is long. and when i go to. the bathroom i need this. cuz it feels like a [ __ ] freight trains. coming out ah didn't mean. to gross you out three minutes in the episode. but what's real is real. dude and we don't [ __ ] around. here at the congratulations. podcast we certainly don't [ __ ] around. it's all real [ __ ] and i talk about what comes. to my mind because you can't you can't. not you know what i'm talking. about i gotta be real i was listening. to my brother's podcast. mentally is confused and is it joe. walsh is that is that who was yeah. joe walsh was saying he can't even though. he's conservative but doesn't like trump. he can't be on panels. because they stick they tell him. to not bash trump when he's doing like fox news. stuff or whatever it is. i don't even know if it's [ __ ] news. but like when it's very conservative. panels and he's and they're and and and other guys. like hannity will just be the yesman. and be like oh yeah of course i won't because this is the job. that joe walsh just he's like i don't know what to. do because i can't lie. about how i feel and jill wash that's what gets you a gold medal. did you understand that that's what gets. you a gold medal because that's awesome. dude because it's weird. when when when when journalists are just on. a [ __ ] agenda or uh what do you call it pundits or [ __ ] i don't know these guys with this shows anytime i has a show and it begins with you know don't call the president. you don't you know what i mean. don't be on the phone. with the president if you have a show that goes like this. it's just in we're here and this. is what happened is an embattled outside. of the jadon and that's my take hello. hello mr. president can't talk to. the president if you show goes and you know it. but it's all good that's the world. we live in now my babies. um so we are [ __ ] five minutes into. this podcast and we were just flying. we were just flying. dude i swear it seems like three minutes. and it's been five but love those guys. over on h3 had a good. time told some stories i actually told this. story and i realized i never told this. on the on the on the on the podcast. on this podcast but it's funny. because i this was insane. one time when i was i had to. go to the bathroom. so bad number two and i hope see daisy i was in public. but i don't care dude. you know what i do. do you know what i do. when i gotta go to. the bathroom in public. number two do you know. what i do i go. bathroom in public number two. because that's how it is dude. that's how it is if toilets are around. i'm using them if i gotta go. i don't people with old germs. and [ __ ] like that that's how you get sick. and i don't use i don't you dude. i only use the [ __ ] the thing you know what i mean. the the cover i only use that when it's necessary. like if there's some blood on the toilet seat. or something i wipe it. off i get a lot of toilet. paper i wipe it off. i wipe it off. so it doesn't touch my hand. as well and then i put the thing on only if there was like blood or [ __ ] or piss but if there's nothing on there and i look at it. and you know what i do. i give it a onceover that's all. i do i give it a onceover and if it's got nothing. on there i don't use it. because it's just touching my thighs. do it if pitch touches your thighs i don't give a [ __ ] bro. i'm living oh my god chris you sat. on though you sat. on the on the toilet. bowl what about getting piss and [ __ ] all over your balls is it on my balls or is it on my thighs so i do it and i don't give a [ __ ] good because that's the kind of life you got to. live on gangster and if you're out. there and if you're going to. the bathroom number two and you're not using those [ __ ] safety. things let me know and i won't read. it but tweeted at me and i won't read. it so i don't do it. one time oh also if if the woman's room. is open haha check that. the man's room if the men's. room is is is [ __ ] used occupied and the woman's is not i'm a chick. apparently i've got a [ __ ] cuz i'm unloading. unloading in the woman's room dude. hey sir what are you. doing it looks like you got a penis. and you're going in the women's. room well apparently right now i'm a female [applause]. oh my god are you strangling. an alligator am i or am. i taking a [ __ ] bro so i went into. the thing the ladies room and it wasn't a single. stall and guess what dude. you [ __ ] up the way you made this building cuz this is still coming out. all right so i go in the woman's room. and i tiptoe because now i'm a woman baby. and i go in the stall you know. how women always tiptoe so i go in the stall and i close. the door and then and then and then i close the door and then and then i'm going. right i'm going and it's all good. but i'm going there wasn't an apple. but even still we have home. with the keyboard so so i'm in there. and i'm going and a lady comes in and instantly. i don't know why maybe it's because i'm a [ __ ] my knees. get real close to. it to each other because i'm scared. and i don't want anybody to. see my balls and i'm trying to. [ __ ] be real real tiny. so nobody could see me even. though i'm still 6 2. and i'm a tall drink. of water right and my shoulders. of course are [ __ ] they go. on for like do you want to. know what the weather is like on thursday. cuz my shoulders go into. next week you know i mean. you want to. know what the [ __ ] weather is like on next thursday well let's take a ride on my shoulders shoulders go on for a week. so let me know where you are. and i'll tell you the forecast all right. so are those your shoulders. yes and it's raining on. friday anyway dude i went in there and my knees. were touching together cuz i scared. cuz the lady [ __ ] came in and she was tiptoeing because she's a lady ladies always tiptoe ladies have never not tiptoed and i'm trying to. be quiet i'm trying not to. let front come out or anything. like that you know. i mean try not to. strangle any alligators and she's like she says did. a guy come in here did anyone. see it no she said did. anyone see a guy come. in here and there's the sliver. of the v the way. they make these stalls dude. make them so there's no way. to peek in you know. there's always like a gap that's like [ __ ] two inches. wide and you could just literally make eye. contact with people while you're [ __ ] dropping. off in and i mean so so she looks at me. after she said no she said. does anyone see a guy. come in here and i go. like this i go like this. i'm like should i make my voice. like a woman like should i literally go. no but i'm like no i'm not gonna pass. for that right if it were nowadays. i would have just been like no. and i know you've got you hear my voice. but i identify as a woman. i would have [ __ ] done that now but this was a while ago. so i just i was like should i go. no and i was like nah. for [ __ ] sake you know the one time when i was a kid when someone i was a kid i don't want to. talk to him. it was i was in high scores. in eighth grade and this. kid was actually wanted to. hang out i didn't want. to hang out he had my number cuz i had cell phones. back then and they called me and he was like hi. i picked up the phone and i was like hello. and he was like chris and i was like [ __ ] he's gonna ask to. hang out and i said oh no. this is chris's mom ellie and he was like oh is chris there. and i said and i literally i literally said i this. is the truth i swear. to god i literally said oh no. he's at the opera he said okay. well tell him to. call me back it's david or whoever well. i remember was and i said okay. click and i remember thinking well he'll believe that. because why the [ __ ] would i pretend i was my mom and say chris was at the opera. because what the [ __ ] there's no operas that go on it. [ __ ] well maybe they do i don't know but not nothing near la. cañada at 5:00 p.m. so. anyway i i didn't do that voice. i just i said she said. did anyone see a guy. come in here and i said no. and i as i say no i look at out. the the crack of the doors. and i'm making eye. contact with her with one eye. and i'm looking at her. and i say no and she just said did. anyone see a guy come. in here and i say no. and i'm a guy oh and then oh no. i didn't say no i said what. i said what which is even. better that's how much of a [ __ ] i was she said never see a guy coming here and i said what and i'm looking at her and she says and i sand and then she says again and i swear to. god this was the only time. that's ever happened in my entire life. she said i said did anyone. see an iphone in here i heard the wrong. thing because i was scared. i'm a [ __ ] that was the first that. was the only time that ever. happened to me it's like. if that happens in movies. and you're like oh get go [ __ ] yourself dude go [ __ ] yourself you know but it really happened and i said oh no no iphone and she just walked out tiptoeing like a lady and i finished up strangling my alligator and then i walked out a man. but that was what was up. that day dude did you know that. so it was good man. one time my friend said he was in a foreign. country with his brother and he was drinking. with his brother and he and his brother. come finds brother for a little bit. and he was outside and there was a huge pile of throwup. on the ground and he was leaning. up against the wall and buddy. said hey did you just throw up. and he said i don't know. ah ah caught redhanded i don't know. hat i don't know dude. not straight up lie no. i don't know is the best. to say i don't know when you know. and you're trying to. get out of not being a [ __ ] you know in trouble or whatever you think is the best. i don't know i don't know that's my favorite. kind of [ __ ] and that's final so you can [ __ ] argue with me all day long but that's my favorite kind of [ __ ] and that's part. because we know what we like we know. what daddy likes we know what [ __ ] daddy likes daddy. likes when guys are [ __ ] sub. itch and they try to. not be some [ __ ] that's the best. thing if a guy's wearing sunglasses at night and bumps into. a [ __ ] thing that's my favorite thing. and that's the end of story dude. okay that's why i like [ __ ] horatio caine so much dude. the shortest the shortest one. ever and that's why we have to. find the killer so quick dude. what the [ __ ] is up. with area 51 first of all are there. 50 other areas it's a bad stand. up dude hey what's the deal. for area 51 what's the world. like there's 50 other areas. just so many new audience. yes all right well you know i'm just saying it'll more than that. yes okay okay well anyway what's going. on in the news that's what's going. on in the news listen. man dude so so uh i [ __ ] area 51 about how there's like 2.2 million people that however many through many people i want to. storm the [ __ ] thing they can't they can't stop us all hey dude yes they can they can't stop us do you know how many they can of you they can stop do you know how many of you they can stop all of you dude. i can't and that that. is the definition. of first to go anybody that. goes i don't care if you're a [ __ ] welltodo person i don't care what race. you are i don't care how smart. you are i don't care if you're helping the world. i don't care what you. do barring you cure cancer. if you show up to. raid area 51 i don't feel bad. if you get mowed down. dude i mean dude. are you kidding me. the people that area 51. so i don't know if you know this but there's like a petition. out there i was like hey we all want to. raid area 51 they can't. stop us all sign up. and we're gonna all go at some point. which i hope is a joke. i run but i don't know anymore. these days it's his facebook. event right 1.5 right now they can't stop all of us. hosted by shitposting because i'm in shambles. okay get a more professional. name anyway we will all meet up. at the area 51 alien. center tourist attraction and coordinate our entry. they have a plan before. that if we now root or run. we can move faster. than their bullets okay. well you can't so i think this. guy started as a joke. obviously but like there are people. that are for sure taking this seriously because there. are too many people now. people that area 51 are. reading this and they're loading their weapons. and they can't wait dude. they can't wait bro. they can't wait hey do you mind. giving me that water. thanks there's they've been waiting. for this dude they're just sitting there. like pretending i mean if there is anything. about aliens at area. 51 like there just been they've been waiting. is this real this is real naruto. running k they're not naruto. running the regular jogging with their hands. behind their [ __ ] so it's all good i mean they're barely jogging so anyway. so anyway they're waiting and then and when they start dude. if i was at area. 51 and they started neruda. running first of all we're you gonna start. from you got to. start from really far away. because their weapons go. real far because their guns they also have [ __ ] other things other than guns. if there really are aliens. there then they are checking out the alien technology. they're just gonna [ __ ] boom like there's gonna be one loud boom and people just gonna lose their left. just disintegrate it's gonna be like the end. of end avengers or whatever. the [ __ ] endgame but ya know rudl run all you want dude those [ __ ] are in there they're ready with their turrets bro and they'll get all of you and they'll just [ __ ] load them up i didn't won't even last that long and that's it and somebody will be done i'll be like weeks right no root oh god and then i will be in the front joe like you know i will be in the back like i was playing i didn't really want to. go i just can't believe that. also naruto running what. we're looking at naruto. running now on the on i mean. dude it's so [ __ ] to. run with your hands behind your back. like that like i know. this japanese [ __ ] they're trying to. be like this is the [ __ ] and in a way it kind of is but it's so [ __ ] to. run like that dude wow to. run just like this mmhmm. it's like you're trying to. get away from your mommy bro. that's not no rutile running. you're try to get away. from your mommy dude. wow you know what i really want to. see a [ __ ] 50 year old naruto. run with a beli imagine neruda. running and falling down but had taken one of those long fall downs. my favorite falling downs are. when people here's the deal. dude if you're gonna fall down just [ __ ] fall right that's the way to. do it but if you're gonna fall down and you keep trying. and the momentum keeps you over. here like almost got i got got and it takes more than a second. or two bro you win. the cebiche award i want one. one time i saw a girl. in high school we were going. to lunch first of all don't ever run. in your car unless like some [ __ ] catastrophes happening. i know a guy ian. edwards that [ __ ] hilarious standup. comedian who was comedies comedy. it's comedy central special just came out. i like that guy walked slower. than [ __ ] i can't imagine him ever i know he'll never have kids. because when you have a kid. you have to. run you know like if a kid. falls down you got to. run over and make sure they're okay he'll never have kids. because he never i can't even. imagine ian running you have a friend. imagine that friend that you'd be like all. he would never run dude. ian edwards would never run. for what i would be like go. ian would you have a run. and he'll be like for wha um anyway. uh yeah oh so this. chick was running to. go to like a lunch. she's trying to like beat the [ __ ] rush and she fell so hard. and it was so [ __ ] up cuz she had a lunchbox and she was like two old devil. lunchbox cuz she was like [ __ ] in 9th or 10th grade. and she fell and had a lunchbox. and the lunchbox like opened and the sandwich. slid out you know. and it was like what the [ __ ] and she just goes ah it was like the peter griffin thing. where he just keeps going. and going oh and i felt bad. but you know what i did. i [ __ ] capable walking dude you fall down. you get up it's not how hard you fall. it's how quickly you get up. and i say that every morning. dude and i also say it sometimes. on my podcast i guess. that girl was [ __ ] hot actually when i was when i was a kid you know she was she was she was that secret girl. that became hot all of a sudden. one day you know when you're in high school. and like the popular girls. are hot and you're like whoa. hold on a second what's up. with rebecca because all of a sudden. i don't know it's like it's i don't know what that. is what is that it's just all. of a sudden i guess maybe puberty or maybe. it's your puberty or it's like. this no hormones and you're like you remember you were in [ __ ] social studies class or math. class or some [ __ ] or you were in [ __ ] spanish class with mr. take ma dude we had a japanese spanish. teacher and yet all sorts. of accents and and and i would you would just be looking. over at like [ __ ] rebecca and you should be like what the [ __ ] why all of a sudden is she hot. what happened it was like the [ __ ] second she became hot you know. and you realize it and here's how dumb guys. are you think you're like oh i'm the only guy. who realizes that now so i could probably. get her and she's like hey [ __ ] [ __ ] i've been dealing with creepy fiftyyearolds. online for [ __ ] seven years but at this point you're you you don't get me dude. and then she runs just runs to. lunch with lunchbox and she [ __ ] falls down and that's just life that has nothing to. do with you know a clap. back or anything like that there's just you just fell because sometimes people. fall you know and that's sad. kinda but but it's not really that. sad though because she's probably got a family now. and even though she [ __ ] fell down now she's got kids. at her [ __ ] fallin that she making lunch. for and they're falling down. with their [ __ ] lunchbox and [ __ ] but you know that's that girl's name. was i don't remember her name. at this point what she looks like now. everybody gets so [ __ ] ugly you know unless you live in la then you [ __ ] rep all all all day long you rip all day long for your whole. life unless you get [ __ ] fat but don't get fat and that's it i've been looking at this. old people face app that people are doing everybody did it. even i did it i don't [ __ ] like to. do all this [ __ ] that everyone does. because
