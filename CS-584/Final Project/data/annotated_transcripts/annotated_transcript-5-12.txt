announce everything that was going. on in either the baseball. players life or anything else in the world. more important than the actual. baseball game like to. be like they'd be like todd. zeile

his mom. and dad as mom and dad. stayed in the southern tip. of florida for most of his child. life and even well into. the adult i believe they're still there. swinging a miss strike one. like that's how they would do it. and i would never be able. to get it to. work onstage cuz it's just like a conversational joke. but that's how they [ __ ] do it i would always [ __ ] i would always i try to. do that bit maybe my maybe six seven. eight nine ten times they'd be like hands leme yulin steps up to. bat hailing from wherever the [ __ ] he hails. from who knows his name is hensley nobody's name.
