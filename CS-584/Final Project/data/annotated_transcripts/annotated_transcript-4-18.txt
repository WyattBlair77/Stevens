[ __ ] movie from josh. brolin to that [ __ ] old woman. who plays his grandmother that's. in uh ozark and uh i'm watching the movie. and i'm like an hour. in and there's one fight scene. and they s and and and it's one of those. movies that every thing is something. new it's like a science fiction. it's like yeah the harkenings and the israelites. and the ice and the aids. and buddhism and the nodes 19. like every other word is a word. you understand and i'm like all right. i gotta [ __ ] under okay okay okay this is what science fiction. is science fiction happens. to be one of my favorite. genres okay it really happens. to be one of my favorite. genres it's between you're probably like oh. chrisley what's your favorite genre. comedy no comedy is my least. favorite besides [ __ ] like independent movies. that think that they're so good. about drugs or like a movie. about like a family. going through a hard time. that has a [ __ ] joel edgerton in it. you know which by the way. is a [ __ ] banging actor but i just don't want to. see that movie it's gonna have so much. brown in it like he's gonna be wearing a flannel. and have a beard and the sun's gonna be [ __ ] dressed in long johns and i'm just not about that. movie how about that all right. so i'm watching dune. and uh and it's got so many of these words. in it that i don't know. what they mean because they're created. by the [ __ ] guy who wrote the book in 1976 or whatever the [ __ ] it was and then it gets to. the part where they have to. one of the characters says they're describing. a way to become one. in the sand with yourself and how to. use the sand for your advantage. this is what the fremen. do another group of people. labeled by a word that happens. to be made up foreign. should it be free man. yes is it not yes it's fremen. does it piss me. off yes it's like in the [ __ ] movie with tom cruise minority. report and his [ __ ] character's name his last name is anderton just make it anderson all right. we've talked about that before. in this podcast but just call the freman. freeman wherever they said freeman. i'm just like add an e. dekwad dickwood so um so so now uh i'm watching it. and they get to. the point where they describe how you use the desert. and the guy fucking's got the nerve. to say that's called desert. power why'd we get off. the train here why'd you stop unpacking. the suitcase now why'd we take a rest. nine tenths up the track why do we do this make if you're making a name for an entire race. of people if you're making a name for a 400. meter worm that swims underground. if you're making a name for planets that by the way. you created that don't exist. then make up a name for having power. in the desert okay that. right there i paused it. and i looked over to. chris now here's my ex. first of all here's the other thing. too i love josh. brolin i love josh brolin. he killed it when he played thanos. right he really killed it. he was wasted in this. movie he was wasted in this. movie he did one scene where he fought and he should have been more. like [ __ ] hello timothy chalamet right. but he was just like come on. come on you know. like that typical general i wish it. was more creepy whatever that's how i would. have played it dude. i can't wait to. [ __ ] do a part it's over it's over any insecurities. i ever had with any director should i say. this should i make this choice. i'm doing crazy [ __ ] anyway um so now they're they're calling it desert. power and i pause it and i look over. to kristen they say desert. power like three times in the movie. by the way i look over. kristen and i'm like what the [ __ ] huh. and she's like it's so great. and i say the movie and she's like i love it. and i'm like ah for [ __ ] oh for [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] sake why and i say why do you love it and she says because it's beautiful it's an experience and like and i was like yeah but the story though and she's like well i don't know i like it i'm like oh for [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] ass okay fine but i rested within myself knowing that when we were done with the movie i was going to. look up the reviews and i was going. to be right and not only that i was going. to comb the internet. for fans and what they said. so i turned it off. slept on it woke up the next day. checked it everyone [ __ ] loved it. everyone loves the movie so i guess. i'm wrong dude i guess. that's just how it's gonna be okay. yay [ __ ] you win world. everyone likes dunes so. i like dune i'm changing. my [ __ ] opinion i don't i don't know movies. anymore goddamn desert power [ __ ] desert. power that's what you're gonna. call it [ __ ] ass dude call it something. italy call it desert magic power. that's like something jeanclaude van. damme would say in a movie. that's because we have that's because we have. desert power and you'd be like well yeah that's what [ __ ] that's the writers they got you know what i mean. that son of a [ __ ] we're going to. get him well how are we going. to do that john for some reason. that's your name even though. you're [ __ ] so obviously from from belgium. not jen john john we're going. to use desert power and you're like oh okay that's what [ __ ] and then you google the writer and he wrote like this. and another thing called like [ __ ] cabin in the valley. that was that was like the fifth. guy from csi was the lead. of it and it came out. in [ __ ] night 2002. anyway dude um dunes fine everyone likes it. and they already are making the sequel. and i'm like dude just don't set. the movie up how did it. i don't i don't know dude. and then i was talking to. somebody that loved the movie. and they were and i was like dude. it just seemed like everything i've seen before. and they're like well yeah but dune. was first and i'm like you're right. dude all right i lose. then i [ __ ] lose you're right. you're right it was before. star wars they're using the voice. [ __ ] luke skywalker uses the the force and timothy chalamet and dune. [ __ ] says can i have some water. um but it is what it. is dude um there's a lot of stuff. going on in the world though. uh oh [ __ ] speaking of halloween michael myers. uh the movie came out halloween. kills it's called. there's like 20 of them. jamie the curtis is still. in it usually movies. that just keep going and going. like eventually they're like all right. to the first like like johnny. depp isn't still in friday. the 13th reboots and [ __ ] but uh jamie lee curtis is. is still in it and and usually they're like okay. you're 90. [ __ ] it we let's she's in it though um and um i i watched it uh half. of it just to. kind of see it and then i saw i googled movies. always after i googled it. and i saw the headline. that uh now michael myers. is canceled because he's homophobic and that's a real thing. that i read on. yahoo that people were covering. because there was a twitter outcry about how michael myers. is homophobic because he killed two. gay uh a gay couple. in the movie and michael myers. uh is not homophobic. he just kills the problem. with michael myers isn't that he's homophobic. you know that's not the problem. the problem with michael myers. is that he's a psychopath. killer and even still he's not real. you can't be homophobic if you don't exist. right hey jiminy cricket you're racist. hey they're three little pigs you're toxic. no you're not because you don't exist. clavorp you're sexist right now you're probably like who's clavorp. he's no one i made him. up you know why he doesn't exist. so that's the same thing. as saying michael myers you're homophobic michael myers. has a butcher knife and stabs whoever's closest to. him but also more importantly than that. michael myers doesn't exist. so he's not even really. stabbing anyone also how about this. people who are mad that. michael myers is now homophobic. don't you want to. be included isn't it right. to include everyone nowadays. you need to. be inclusive so shouldn't michael myers. be stabbing the [ __ ] out of whites. blacks jews uh homosexuals trans people uh you know. short people also he hasn't killed. a short person yet. that i've seen sure people should be angry. at him you can't win. imagine your platform is [ __ ] imagine on your platform you're yelling. about the wokeness of a [ __ ] slasher film i just can't really understand things. anymore and i suppose that's just how it's gonna be for me because what is it gonna get better i'm 41. what is one day. i'm gonna wake up and i'm just gonna get the world. the older you get you get smarter. i guess but it's not like you learn. [music] what the while you learn. more the exponential uh you exponentially learn. what you don't know. and you're [ __ ] you know after i mean 40 you're just like oh there's so much i don't know and there's going to. be a whole much more that. i don't know i think that's why. we end up dying it's just the weight. of you know people get curvy. as [ __ ] right they just [ __ ] shrink a little bit it's because the weight of what the [ __ ] they realize they don't know is just like ah [ __ ] that's so heavy what and then one day they're like i'm gonna croak and they don't even know that they're subconsciously doing this but it's just like [ __ ] man that's why people have heart attacks and get cancer they're just like i i don't exactly want to. kill myself but god damn. we all gotta [ __ ] get desert. power is what we gotta get michael myers. included gay people and that's why i think that michael myers. is an ally for lgbtq. community um lgbtq [ __ ] did i say it right god damn it yes i did say right i did say it right yay go me um i love this [ __ ] here's another thing that does anybody online ever are they ever nice you know like i saw virgil. abalo's new shoes that he's coming out. with they're mid uh um air. force ones and the at first when i saw him i was like ah cool i liked them. i looked on many posts. and there wasn't one. good one one good comment and i hope these [ __ ] honestly mean it because i want to. get them all right and it's too hard. to get the shoes. man you got to. wake up at like seven. o'clock or pay over price and that's just like i'm not gonna do. that for these at least but i like these shoes. so [ __ ] i didn't see one good [ __ ] thing dude about these shoes. even my friends were texting look how horrible these are once you get to. be the top dog man. everybody hates you but where's the love though. where's the love you don't see. it right like all everyone. talks about on twitter joe rogan. is how how much they disagree. with his opinions you know what i mean. he's the number one [ __ ] guy elon musk. i mean really honestly. the only people that tout elon musk. on social media. are like frat dudes. but everyone else is like oh [ __ ] what a quack where's. the love dude everyone. [ __ ] hates jeff bezos. i don't know dick about. jeff bezos oh wrong one. hell yes that's the right. one but where's the love dude. i don't [ __ ] know my head [ __ ] hurts from this [ __ ] um i guess spreading more love or whatever is what i'm trying to. say how about this [ __ ] alec baldwin. thing jesus christ man. i didn't really want to. get too heavy because of this. [ __ ] wig i'm wearing but jesus christ. dude it's timely alec baldwin i mean no everybody knows i'm i guess i got to. explain it to. lead into it but like alec. baldwin had a gun given to. him that was loaded. on set and he shot through. the camera and killed the dp. or the camera woman and um she's dead. she died um the fact that anybody first of all. let me just say this. let me just start by this. i don't know how um that. happens at all okay i don't know. how that happens. at all i've been in on set. holding guns and firing guns. and it's very obviously not a gun. that works it's a gun. that is plastic or some metal. components and you shoot it and it goes and it's air. that comes out and they you can put the fire. the cgi [ __ ] in later okay um so even on that set they would be like don't point the guns. at anyone yeah it's just air. but you never know. and nobody did that nobody did it. the whole set was flooded with guns. nobody ever did anything like that the fact. that there are still guns. like real guns being used. on sets at all is is just not it's so stupid. it's just dumb right. one life is too many. and this has happened multiple times um everyone is now. [ __ ] on the woman. i believe who got who was the uh handler. i forget what they're called. armorer uh and she got the job. because her dad was someone. who was important in the industry. and everyone's saying this is what happens. with nepotism she didn't earn her position. sure of course that's wrong. um this woman apparently went shooting with the gun. before this and then somehow it wound. up on set and it was given to. the ad and then the ad. gave it to. alec baldwin now nobody should touch guns. on set except for the props. person and then also the actor using the gun. um that's often not the case. you know because it's just a rule and people don't abide. by it but this is what [ __ ] happens. uh everyone is want you. know screaming for this woman. to look my friend texted. me this woman should go to. [ __ ] jail she ruined. so many people's lives and i wrote back. i might be way. off here but it was a mistake. yeah it's horrible and he's like but she affected. people's lives it's manslaughter even though. she didn't mean to. she was like i was like well i i guess. i don't know really what technically. manslaughter is but i thought it was like drunk driving or you're getting a bar fight and they're not killing. someone you don't really intend to. kill someone but then they end up dying. she was not trying. to do any harm. here she was trying to. do her job albeit it. was a really bad job. her life guess what is over. no matter what right. her life is over whether you shame. her or not she has to. feel the worse she's ever. felt and by the way. probably the worse she's ever. going to feel and that's going. to last a long long. long long time people are mad. at alec baldwin most people are who are mad. at him are have what i've seen online. are the republicans that are way. for gun control way against gun control because alec baldwin was an outspoken person. saying we need to. have less deaths and you know i guess he was wanted. an advocate of gun. safety or if i don't. know if you didn't want them. or why i don't i'm not really clear. on alec baldwin's whole stance. on gun control but i know. he isn't a proponent of it. and um now like donald trump. jr and [ __ ] are posting like countless memes about how dumb alec baldwin. is and you know i'm not. i don't believe in like the whole shaming. culture and [ __ ] like but like if if there is shaming this is what it is um they're shaming alec baldwin in oh you know i i'm a respectful gun owner i have [ __ ] 60 guns. and i've killed less people than you. have and it's like putting it like donald. trump jr put something like this. up and everyone is like oh [ __ ] uh ha ha. [ __ ] alec baldwin not everyone you know people are are in support of him but this was a mistake and guess what this is probably the worst thing that is ever going to. happen or has happened. to alec baldwin his life is forever. changed and guess what all of your memes. and [ __ ] attacking these people and trying to. make them [ __ ] want to. end their own lives um it doesn't change. what happened and how about the fact. that somebody died for real. during this accident this is the thing i never understood do it. and i see some comedians doing. it too it's like the quickest. to make the joke. oh [ __ ] this happened gotta make a joke. about it what about the fact. and i make a lot of jokes. dude i never am the guy. i've never i've never done the thing. i gotta be first to. talk about it oh i gotta do this. joke before someone else does. it i don't give a [ __ ] about that. [ __ ] never have i ever been like that. um but i see these people that are like trying. to make these [ __ ] first jokes. which are terrible [ __ ] jokes. and this husband and her kids. or one kid or two. kids their their their life is forever. changed dude their life is forever. changed alec baldwin's life is forever. changed it's [ __ ] puts it into. perspective a little bit and now i haven't always done. that in my life but i have a [ __ ] platform look should she work as a [ __ ] armor ever again probably not should she go to. jail i don't think so it was a mistake. i feel really [ __ ] badly man. i see that [ __ ] and i don't know if it's because like i'm in a different place. now or i have a son. or all of the you know. ptsd that i have about the internet. or whatever the [ __ ] but it puts me in a real [ __ ] [ __ ] place man and i start crying because people lose focus of the fact that this family is ruined i mean this this woman's dead and this husband doesn't have a [ __ ] wife anymore. and these kids or kid. or whatever i can't remember if he was one. or two kids they don't. have a [ __ ] mom anymore. and now i got to. see along with the rest of the world. that picture of her behind the camera. that's this beautiful shot of her. doing what she loves and i got to. know who she is because of this. and i'm not saying in a selfish. way but there's no reason. why i should know or anybody should know. who this person is because they should just be living their [ __ ] life and not everybody knows what. the [ __ ] happened you weren't on set. oh god i'm so sick. of people [ __ ] doing these yeah whatever pushing their agenda. you know it is what it. is nothing i say is going. to change anything and michael myers. is [ __ ] homophobic for [ __ ] sake i was on stage the other night and i did no let me just tell this actually i woke up it was a day i don't remember what day it was but i woke up it was like a week ago nah it was less than that i i was in a [ __ ] mood i was [ __ ] not happy at all uh all day cried twice during that day i'll be honest [ __ ] it i know a lot of people are gonna watch this episode because i'm in a rick wig and i didn't want to. [ __ ] talk about this but who gives a [ __ ] look i cried. twice that day for i don't even. know what reason i just started crying. okay i was alone. most of the day uh except for in the evening. or in the afternoon i was playing with calvin. and it was very bittersweet because i was in a [ __ ] mood and i was playing with calvin. and i loved being his dad. and um there was a point. where i was so deep. in the darkness that i was like trying. to just focus on calvin to. make sure that he felt loved and i think i was able. to crack a smile but it was just shitty. all day and i told uh this booker that. i would come down and do a set. all day i was thinking i'm not going. to be funny i'm not good. um i don't want to. do this i haven't done. i've only done stand up. a few times since i've been back. what 20 times and i feel like i don't have. the chops to. [ __ ] overcome this emotion um uh i don't know. what's going on with my body. but i just don't feel right. going on stage but i told the guy. i'd go and he was counting on. me to go so i thought you know. what i don't i don't want to. go but i told the guy. i would go i got to. be a guy who says what he means. and my first show ever ever. my first show ever when i started doing. standup i remember being so [ __ ] nervous that uh i was like how am i gonna get on stage and i thought if i just put my legs in the direction one by one. by the in the in the direction of the stage. and then i got on stage uh i would be on stage. and then i would have to. talk so i'm gonna make my body move. even though my mind. doesn't want it to. and i did that and i went on stage. and i had a find set whatever. but now here i am again. and i'm in a different situation. i'm in a darker place. i've had a rough year and a half. whatever the [ __ ] it is i can't shake this horrible feeling. and and i don't want to. uh underplay the feeling it. was a very dark feeling. that um i couldn't i just there. was no snapping out of it. and i thought here i am. again i don't want to. go down to the to. the laugh factory i don't want to. do this show but i made my body get in my car. i made my body drive down. to the place and i drove down to. the place and i sat in my car. for 20 minutes i didn't want. to get out of the car. and i thought you got to. make your body [ __ ] go into. at least go into. the laugh factory after 20. minutes i did i walked in and the guy. this the the woman there says hey glad you're here. the next comic uh isn't here do you want. to go up next and i say and i and i i listened to. the crowd and the guy in front of me. is murdering and i think oh [ __ ] i'm still really upset. and i don't have the chops. right now to. go on and do well after this. guy who is absolutely. murdering but i gave up i gave up on the feeling. of darkness i gave up on the feeling. of feeling shitty and i made myself. say yeah [ __ ] it i'm gonna bomb but i'll go up and she said ah you're not gonna bomb or something and i said uh we'll see so the guy gets off stage everyone goes nuts. and they he comes off. and he's like hey are you on next. and i'm like yeah he's like hell yeah. kill him i was like dude. there's no way i'm gonna [ __ ] do this i'm not gonna be able to. do this so he says he laughs she says be fine. so i get on stage. i get a really big ovation. when i go on stage. and um i do my set for some reason. it's the best set that i've had in five years. i don't understand why something. about the energy something about how i felt like this. the deck was stacked. against me the awful. feeling that i had all day. for hours and hours for some reason. just turned into. this moment of in my mind. it felt like this magical. [ __ ] thing i was on stage people were laughing. when i thought they should laugh. and when i was quiet. they were listening nobody was trying. to ruin any punchline or nobody was woo. it was all it was like perfect and i put the microphone. down i say thank you. and the whole place. stands up and they give me. a standing ovation and i walk. off stage and i'm in now. back into the world. i had this crazy bad. day on stage i let it go it. felt like magic and now. i step back into. the world and immediately guys. want to give me hand. shakes girls are out there. hey with their fist bumps and dudes are fist bumping. the guy says hey will you sign. this for me i grab a pen. i'm not even looking at what i'm. signing and then i realize it's the menu. to the laugh factory that i'm just defacing right. and i walk upstairs and i'm by myself. and i don't really know how to. process everything that's happened because when you go on stage. every single time it's like you hear this. big train going by and you're just like okay. this is going to. be not what life is. usually like for the next however. long this train lasts. and that's how long your set. is it's not normal people are just staring at you. and life is different for a little bit. and it's loud and it's fast. things are happening that. you're not really uh you know. used to in your daily. life as a comedian you are but that's only when you're on stage. so i'm now i'm sitting there alone. and i'm alone again. and i remember how i felt 30. minutes before this and i remember how bad it. was and i don't feel that. bad anymore i actually feel okay. and then this guy comes up. to me and he says hey chris and i say yeah. and he says i gotta say and he gives me. a compliment i'm not going to. tell you what the compliment. is because number one i don't want to. seem like i'm bragging and i can't do that without telling you what a guy. said when he compliments. me for and number two i don't want to. tell you because that's for me. it's for me and this guy. told it to. me and it was special. and it was nice he gave. me the compliment and then he walked away. and he said thanks and i said no. man honestly you made my day thank you he walked away. and i cried for the third. time i mean i burst out. but it was for a different. reason it was because i got through the day and it was hard. but i just made my body do the things. that it needed to. do and now it was a different. time and i felt differently. and ain't that just how this podcast. goes where the time i'm going. to tell you a long. emotional story about a dark period. i had in a [ __ ] rick sanchez halloween. costume but that's how it goes and that's when it happened and i just want to. let you guys know that. that happened because i know. some people listen to. me and struggle with their own. things and you're listening i'm talking we're together. right now i'm not the smartest person. here with all of us. okay i just happen. to be the one talking and you guys. happen to be the ones. listening i say i'm not the smartest one i'm not the most emotional. i'm not the most talented. but i am telling you. if i can get through that. day and not be any of those things. the most then i know you can so that's that. and i thought about telling you. this next week because i wouldn't be dressed like rick sanchez. but no that's not how it's gonna be there. um what else happened that's [ __ ] funny oh that. [ __ ] night dude. no no not that night that [ __ ] it was a night before. this is [ __ ] i get on stage i'm talking about [ __ ] on stage like all the [ __ ] i went through and uh uh my family and my fiance and my kid and and i get off stage and i go to. thank the people running the. show and this uh i go to. the thing and i and i get a tap. on my shoulder i turn around and it's this. beautiful woman right and she's like hey that was great. and i say oh thanks. and she says you should come. get a drink uh with me. after this and i [ __ ] laughed very hard like in her face i didn't mean. to partially because look uh my act was all. about my family and my fiance and this. struggle and partially because this is it. dude this is the moment. where i can either uh crack. or not and i laugh and i say oh oh i would love to. but i can't just like that i said. it just like that and [ __ ] the the [ __ ] promoters laughed hard. right and i'm because we know what the [ __ ] going. on and she says oh god. cause she was taking a bath because i laughed and she said. how come she said are you. sober or something and i said. actually yeah and they laughed even. harder and it just felt good. to like i was talking earlier. be a guy who [ __ ] said i uh be a guy who can struggle but also wants to. be uh true to. his word uh yeah but it was [ __ ] funny as [ __ ] man. we were dying we were dying. and then she had a [ __ ] purse that had a christian dior it. said chris it said kristen. dior and cd and i was like oh those are my initials y'all. got to get out. of here and i [ __ ] left uh yeah. that was funny i told it. to kristen and we laughed and we laughed i'll save that story for next. time um [music] dune. huh i don't know what. else can we talk about is. there anything else that that i [ __ ] did i miss anything. that happened oh dude. the [ __ ] how about the fact that i'm smart. as [ __ ] dude i know people dude if there's one thing i know it's people i don't know things like math and science and all that other [ __ ] things about the earth dude bye bye i don't know about you but one thing i know about is people now either one or two episodes ago i was talking about the property brothers and i said about the property brothers hey guys there is no way one of you don't have knight's armor set. up in your [ __ ] house. and guess what dude. they do they do they do one. of them has knights armor set up in their [ __ ] house they have that i know that and i know that not because i saw that i know that because of course those guys are those guys and i want you to. understand how much i know people because that's how i did it. i'm like the simpsons when they predicted. everything about [ __ ] donald trump. and [ __ ] you can go back and be like the simpsons really predicted everything. how about the fact. that i predicted also really important. things too like the property. brothers happen to actually have a [ __ ] night so i just know dude. i told you about the story once. when i was with my one. of my exes and she was like we were talking. about some guy down the way. and she was like i was like you probably. like that guy he's handsome. hun she was like yeah something and i was like yeah. i was like i was like uh we got into. an argument about who knows people more. and i was like pic. pick anyone and she said what about that guy. said oh yeah that guy. you like it's cause you like. that guy you think he's handsome. she's like no she's like i don't know. like whatever and i'm like you think you know. more about people than i do. all right cool i'll tell you right. now that guy makes his own. furniture and she goes that's the [ __ ] thing that's the thing you want to. say i said yeah she had balls not actually you know. what i mean she had like gusto. or whatever the [ __ ] she walked over she didn't give a [ __ ] she's like i'm gonna go walk up she sits down talk to. this handsome hunk looks over. me like what the [ __ ] comes back. he says yeah he actually made a [ __ ] he does he makes like he made his table in his house. and he put together his cat. i'm like dude even i shot. me with that one but dude. sometimes your first [ __ ] goto. [ __ ] is i think sometimes we have this [ __ ] sort of like i read that book the gift of fear and it was like it lets you know that like that thing the whole. thing women's intuition that [ __ ] is real because that's how it keeps us alive um right like there was one story in that book where this guy all of a sudden knew he was gonna get robbed in his car and he didn't know why until like weeks later he realized maybe he saw some like something he saw he saw the guy coming out of his rear view mirror in his peripheral view but he was like but that shouldn't be weird to. me because the rearview mirrors or the side. mirrors you always see people. from coming from behind you but then you realize that. the reason why i knew he was gonna get robbed. is because if he actually thought about it. um that image in that side. mirror was moving was moving way quicker. than normal so he knew something. weird was gonna happen my point. is you can pick [ __ ] up and you don't even. know why maybe that guy. was [ __ ] with his hands like how i saw him another guy [ __ ] with his hands that used to. do manual labor or some [ __ ] i don't know but i guessed furniture. making and he makes his own. furniture and your boy [ __ ] deserves a medal. for that doesn't deserve a medal. for turning a girl down for a drink. but definitely deserves a medal. for understanding that that dude. definitely absolutely makes some furniture and also one. of the property brothers has. a [ __ ] knight's armor in his house. so that's it that's that. the episode that was the halloween. episode it was very spooky. i know i'm sorry to. scare the [ __ ] out of you um but just remember uh make friends in the comments of this. and brush up against that like button and absolutely [ __ ] unbelievably obliterate that subscribe. subscribe dude you know. what i mean hey guys that's the episode. on youtube uh to. catch the rest of the episode. all you have to. do is sign up for our. patreon patreon dot com crystalia. and uh you can get the extended version. of this episode and also uh we do one. episode a month uh that is extra and um that's on our patreon. and you can get access to. all those back uh episodes. on our patreon on our patreon. it's six bucks a month. so we appreciate you and uh byebye.
