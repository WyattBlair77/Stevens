right uh morty. was [ __ ] there dude rick was right. you can easily that's what we have. is our language that's all. we have is our language. dude if you're not firing on. all syllables with your language. then what are we doing dude. it's like when you're like what did. he say and you tell them. generally what somebody said and then you're like okay. is that as good as you. could remember or is that. exactly what he said and they're like i don't. know it's like it was exactly. what he said and you're like dude. do you not know. or is it exactly what. he said because he said both. and they're like i i i think it. was what he said i'm not asking. if you think i'm asking you if that's exactly. what he said or if you have the general. idea of what he said. and you're relaying that to. me yeah okay i get it. i get it i get it. it's rick and morty. but i believe that [ __ ] and we all [ __ ] up but one time dude i was i was sitting i was watching tv with kristin. and i was like this. is what that person just said on. tv and she was like no. they said it the other way. and i said i know. for certain that this is not what they said. and we replayed it and she was right. and i was wrong and then i realized it. was only because of the way. they cut it on the tv. all good dude all good. it wasn't my fault. it was the editor's [ __ ] fault. dude it was her fault. too for dragging me. into it it sucked. whoa got out of that. one i love getting out. of him dude i love getting out. of them whatever man. it's hot and it's all good. what did he say [ __ ] what was the thing. he said you know. who got me the election. you know who got me. the election i got me. the election absolute [ __ ] absolute [ __ ] takedown i love this [ __ ] about how everyone at star wars fans are getting upset about the backlash for removing there's a backlash from removing the word the name slave one first of all star wars called boba. fett's ship slave one. so it's like you should have known. in [ __ ] 30 years you were gonna get in some [ __ ] slave one dude but and now people of like star wars who cares dude just who cares this is the other thing too they're only changing. the name because they think it. hurts their bottom line they don't give a [ __ ] about anything but their bottom line. whatever it is disney. or whatever it says in the right. here star wars fans are. outraged again over a decision. to remove the slave. one name from one. of the iconic space cruisers disney. has quietly dropped the moniker because they know they're not gonna sell if they call it. the slave one right but that is not the thing. that i think is hilarious. the thing that i think is hilarious. is that there are people. who are mad at this. and doing stuff like this. like this guy tweeted. boba fett actually his handle. is boba fett anhse mark. anthony austin you'll always be slave. one to me and like okay. like they don't imagine the people. at disney seeing that tweet. how little of a [ __ ] they give if you call it. the slave one they don't. give a [ __ ] [ __ ] just being like yeah okay you call it whatever you want we're just not going to. do it because it hurts our. bottom line we're in the business. of making money not. naming [ __ ] hyper devoted star wars fans are notorious for causing. a stink over. revisions and updates to. their beloved brand dude. dorks just dorks who cares. call it [ __ ] hippie dippy. i don't care all right. well and then imagine tweeting well. i'm still calling it to. say the slave one. oh that's nice for you. and your family bro

was getting offended. we were nobody had the internet. we were just in the meantime. you're one of the [ __ ] people on this internet that is causing. the [ __ ] outrage that's making everything. annoying stop tweeting your [ __ ] problem. and just write a goddamn letter. to disney you know uh yeah. this is a problem i'm tweeting. it i'm not gonna call up. my [ __ ] i'm not gonna call up the
