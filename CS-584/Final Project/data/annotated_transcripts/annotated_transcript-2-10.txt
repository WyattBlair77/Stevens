weekend you can watch your tour report though i woke up one morning and like probably six a.m and i can't remember last time this happened but have you when's the last time you woke up and you're and you're like one of your limbs was numb okay that's happened to. me a bunch of times in my life. obviously as it has you i woke. up and it was so numb. dude how come every time it happens. when you wake up in your arms um it every time. you wake up you just think this. is it it's not gonna come. back it's not coming back not this. one dude and it's so heavy and so big feeling and it's so [ __ ] numb. i don't even like feeling. it and i'm trying so hard. to [ __ ] grip something and i can't it's just flopping around. like it's my dick. and dude it was so numb. that i resigned to. the fact immediately that it was. not coming back and it took so long and i was like what am. i going to do. how's my life gonna be like just in colorado. springs wake up at 6am how's my life going to. be i guess it could be okay. i can hold the microphone. with this hand and then slowly. but surely it came back. and then i laid back. down and went back to. sleep bro like the fact that all of that. happened in the middle of my sleep. and then also i wasn't saying a word. like i was so tired. and then went back to. sleep and i haven't told [ __ ] a soul about it until now is hilarious. like i was so stressed out. didn't utter a word and just waited and prayed to. the gods that my [ __ ] arm would come back. and it did um how about this. [ __ ] lana del rey thing i guess she was she had you know what i don't get musicians. and i thought that kind of rappers just did. this but like musicians. that are so late to. perform like i've never started. my show more than 20. minutes late and you've i don't even think i've started. more than it's been always less. than 20. unless no even when there was no. i've never done that i've never done. it more than that but lana. del rey i guess got on stage so so late it was she was supposed. to do like a 40. minute set got on stage. at 11 45 and there was a hard. curfew at midnight like some places. are either stateowned or you know. just you can't go over. 12 midnight because of a certain law. and they cut her mic. at 11 45 or i'm sorry. at 12. so she did 15. minutes and everyone [ __ ] litter up because she they were like we we paid for this. [ __ ] for your concert. bro imagine people came to. see me and i did. 15 minutes and that was it. i mean i do a full hour. at least but like so not worth it. it's also even doing 35. minutes it's like these ticket prices are so high what what what. um place was it you know. it was a music. festival and she was supposed. to go on yeah. go right glastonbury yeah and the reason. she gave on stage. was that she was lazy because my hair. takes so long eh. oh dude she's my wife. oh dude she's my wife. oh i dude honey are you. lana del rey dude i had no idea. she's my wife that's crazy. i'm

bring up in the text. chain but everyone was against me um toronto. blue jays fire well okay this is all pretty wacky but the toronto. blue jays dropped pitcher anthony. bass for antilgbtq comments now i. don't know so when you read that. you think okay he hates gays and trans. people that's what you think maybe. but if you're a little bit smarter. you'll be like oh wait a second. the media acts like your antilgbtq if somebody tells you hey i'm trans. and you go oh they act like because you do that. 900 trans people are going. to get hit by a car. right like if you're just not totally like when someone says hey i'm trans. if you don't go give me a t. and have five people behind you. t give me an r. r oh trans like if you don't. do that you're perpetuating genocide. you know what i'm saying like that's what the media. acts like if you don't literally carry. around a [ __ ] rainbow flag. in los angeles if you live here for at. least two hours a day. during pride month you're the reason. that trans people are dying. so that's what the media. so and this is by cnn which is woke. [ __ ] central but let's read it. all these [ __ ] news outlets suck. [ __ ] huge balls and dick um the toronto. blue jays have design designated pitcher. anthony bat this is where you. come to the news. from by the way. me dude we hit it. hard anthony bass for assignment. following and an anti so. what did he share. i don't even know the move. comes hours before the blue. jays first game of pride weekend. there we go and the team. see this is the thing. so blue jays general manager. so i know kind of what happened. a little bit apparently he's like the best. pitcher on the team. too um and bass shared an instagram. post that called for antilgbtq. boycotts of target oh that's what he. did right so this wasn't even. something that he was saying. right um he posted. well maybe it was but he posted. that there should be boycotts of target. and bud light because target sells uh sexual. underwear for children which is [ __ ] batshit. crazy to me and then bud. light uh which i don't really give a [ __ ] about but they just have that. crazy dylan mulvaney same i'm. a woman and drink bud. light which i don't care about. at all because i don't give a [ __ ] i don't drink. beer and also i don't care that much. and it doesn't affect me. in the least um but the lgbtq community uh okay so he called it. evil the post said it. was evil and demonic. which is a real buzzword for this. like any time someone says something about like there. are people who are too far. right that when somebody says somebody is trans. that they think well that's the devil. in them and it's just like it's like okay. but there's no devil. so what are you don't. be so ridiculous anyway so the people the woke. mob took to. the you know i guess. it was twitter and mostly twitter. probably and um and they basically forced quote unquote. the organization the blue. jays organization to. tell anthony bass to. apologize for the thing so he did. and um then also it's toronto. jesus is so woke uh so then he got fired. anyway because it's never good enough. for the woke it's never [ __ ] good enough for the far left it's never good enough. hey apologize okay sorry oh you're gonna. [ __ ] let this guy still have his job. they want make no mistake. the woke people are the biggest hey don't bully. us but the biggest bullies. this is just they are not happy. until you end your life this. is just the truth this. is the only power they have. and it works when it comes. to corporations case in point. toronto blue jays but um yeah this guy was a pitcher and apparently he had like he was like kind of the best on the team and they just got rid of them because he posted something on his private. tick tock on his private. uh instagram not in uniform. now let's rewind all the way. to and i'll i'll definitely get into. some hot water here. but i don't actually give a [ __ ] at this. point um what's his name um. kaepernick right kneeled knelt in before. the game in uniform. during business hours okay uh the woke. people meaning the media. said to said how crazy it. is that they'd have a problem with this. he should be able to. do this and people should be able. to stand for what they need. to stand for now. i am not saying i agree. with anthony bass i am not. saying i agree with colin kaepernick. i'm not saying i disagree with them. what i am saying is. if you are somebody who wants to. advocate for free speech it's got to. be all of it it's got to. be all of it and guess what that's gonna. [ __ ] suck sometimes for you but because people are going to. say [ __ ] you don't agree with do i think that trans people have the devil. in them no i don't okay. but i guess people are gonna have to. say that and some people are gonna have jobs that say that. and then when they say that. you got to just go. like this wow that person. it sucks they're crazy but because of that he can't throw a ball. the [ __ ] that have to. do with anything it is such a crazy. [ __ ] time we live in and now uh i walk around just to. spite everyone i think anthony. that's his greatest pitcher. ever lived he can strikeout anybody. if he was around during babe. ruth times babe ruth wouldn't have got that. many home runs neither would mickey mantle. needed with roger maris neither. would barry bonds um i do think though. that it's crazy what he was saying. about how uh they have the devil. in them um because they don't but whatever. i'm just free speech is. a kind of a thing i go. you know what i go. back and forth on i do believe in it. because i'm a i'm a comedian. but also like i don't know there's a fine line. of what hate speech is. uh i just don't like when people act like because you uh are some guy. that's just like passively saying your beliefs. that you're you're the reason. why people [ __ ] die. because that's not true silence. isn't violence violence is violence. we've said that a bunch on on. this podcast before and that's that. i also should say that. because here's the other thing too i had a buddy. who got kicked off of instagram. because he was saying stuff. about i don't remember what it. was either trump or the vaccines. and he was like bro. can you help me. out this is [ __ ] up that like they took my account down and it's free speech and i don't get to. say it now and it's actually not because it's a business. like there are rules. and guidelines you have to. go by about instagram and it sucks. the rules are guys they have to. go to on youtube. we get flags sometimes. for saying [ __ ] that you have to. make sure you're 18. to sign into. the [ __ ] thing to. watch the video and i'm sure we spread miss. all we do is spread. misinformation on this podcast. that's the point of this podcast. and um you know it's well within youtube's right. to be like this is not what we want. in our business just like it's well. within the right of the toronto. blue jays to. be like ah this guy doesn't believe in what the [ __ ] we believe in so he's out. of the [ __ ] league however my point still stands. what the [ __ ] does that have to. do with throwing the ball. and here's the other thing. too um fans are booing. but they don't really give a [ __ ] that's the thing. they're booming because it's easy to. boo they're still at the [ __ ] game they're still at the game. meaning they still purchase the ticket. so it's not really hurting. their pockets as a matter of fact. what moves hurt your pockets. so you know i do believe in the fact. that free speech does stop when you talk when you when it comes. to a company right. because it has nothing to. do with free speech this is what the company. might stand for or not. stand for if you go. against their guidelines then you're out i get it. um which is what [ __ ] the nfl. was kind of brushing up against with kaepernick. because they were like well we can't. [ __ ] you know what i mean we can't keep it's bad. luck and we're white and he's black and we're all a bunch of old white guys but i get it so yeah i don't know man it's just not gonna watch that movie um i'm never gonna watch a movie uh i think right now i'll never watch a movie of men okay so that's good and that's what you come here for um thanks for listening this has been another episode of congratulations and i'll tell you this much um you can go over to. the patreon and watch the full. episode patreon dot com crystalia. we love you for it. thank you very much and the patreon. episode drop is dropping. soon and it is bonkers. silly so going over patreon dot com. crystalia leave a comment dude. right here and we appreciate you. um thank you very much. guys byebye [music] thank you. foreign
