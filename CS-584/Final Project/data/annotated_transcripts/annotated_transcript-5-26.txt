[ __ ] wrong i thought i was good at this. [ __ ] you know what i actually. learned about for real they'll they'll have three so the show. is they'll have three guys. and they're all they say one. of them is an mma fighter. you got to guess. which one and then the [ __ ] curtain opens up. and it's three guys and you get to. ask him questions and you got to. find out who the who the hell. the real mma fighter isn't you. guess one now when the curtain opens up. you your first instinct. is the best once you start. asking questions and trying to. figure out you [ __ ] yourself up. because you're thinking about it. too hard i got everyone wrong. because i was thinking about it. too hard i got every single one. wrong and when the curtain opened up i had it. i was like oh it's that. guy and then i was sorry. i think was wrong maybe the guy. i may be cisco maybe the old white guy. maybe saging i'm it was a girl. and i got i lost the whole. time and some reason they're gonna have me back. they liked what i did. so whatever maybe a boy was funny even wasn't good. at the game but maybe a boy was funny. afterwards i said a and anthony anderson i'm like man. i'm bad at it he was like oh you're horrible. ah um so anyway he was wearing a green. suit a black guy can wear a green. suit and not be the riddler. you know but if your white guy. you're the riddler um yeah dude. he must clean up anthony. anderson he does [ __ ] 13 episodes. in like five days they just do that. [ __ ] when i did that other one the the the what's alec. baldwin one whatever that what game. show is i did i think i did. two of those yeah dude. he does like 47 of those. shows in four days and it's like he just must make like [ __ ] 13 million dollars. for it and that that's it. then he then he just [ __ ] smacks a reporter. then he makes all the money. then he go and then he goes and he [ __ ] punches. a paparazzi guy and that's a day. for him he shoots two. episodes of his game show. and then punches a [ __ ] paparazzi guy out. imagine me and famous. for that long though forty years. of just hey alec baldwin. hey or whoever hey excuse me can i go. over here over picture though. i'd be knocking everybody. out i would be doing moves. on people like it wouldn't be punching it. i would be getting him. in [ __ ] suplexes and ddt's and [ __ ] i would be i would do the one where i put their head in between my legs and just [ __ ] hold my arms out and i start and i would start looking at everyone else when they go ah and they'd be like what's he doing what are you doing then i just [ __ ] lean back and smash their head into. their spinal column and i blow i shouldn't ask.

hey we were gonna maybe go to. la i'm gonna meet my girl. here we go me in la. man we're gonna be in pasadena her. manager talking about but hannah and i was just like ah haha [ __ ] i don't know what the [ __ ] what he was saying but he was really nice i think you can feel someone's niceness you don't need to. hear their words so i was. in atlanta and we [ __ ] we didn't do much. there were lots of weddings. going on which are probably mistake. every time i see a wedding. party oh my god dude this part. is for nothing they're probably. gonna get divorced deeper deeper. yeah so i let's see but what else. is it what also later. what were the shows well my favorite show. west palm beach is always a weird. crowd dude west palm beach is never there. like the truman show dude. like it's not a real. town they're always setting up in florida. they're always they have like this. town center where where the improv. is and they're always setting up. for some holiday it's so annoying. it's like they're setting up. for christmas now which is like dude. it's [ __ ] november 6th and then after christmas to. pi the day center. for everything do it they serve. for st. patrick's day i swear to. god there's no way. they don't set up for. st. patrick's day and it's like why are they doing that you're in florida there's no irish in west palm beach they set up for labor. day dude they started for boxing. day in canada i swear. to god they don't give a [ __ ] they love. setting up i've never been there. where the shit's been set. up they're constantly setting up and it's like it's the truman show. and i'm truman and every time i get there. they're like oh okay. here you here you here he is. we gotta act like we're a real. [ __ ] place and they're just like older white people dude the audiences are fine you know they're okay there's like pockets that are good any time you have a comedy club that's over. 400 people it's like hard. to really get going because it's just too big. when you're in the back. it might as well be you like you're watching the show. on tv like that's the thing. if you're watching live comedy. and you laugh it's cool. but if you watch live comedy. and you're laughing at home. by yourself you're a [ __ ] lunatic now i've done it but i'm just saying to. be like watching a special and just by yourself in just be like yeah like in in in standup. la it's such a live medium. you know it would be it's basically the equivalent. of if you're watching a concert. on at home you're holding your lighter. up or your [ __ ] cell phone by yourself so sad. eating blue apron just with your lighter. lemmya an mer alone dude. i've had that song stuck in my head. the lorne order theme. song stuck in my head. for [ __ ] three weeks now doomdoom doomdoom tintin. dude i love when a show is so 90s. and then it just is so successful. and it keeps going and going. and now it's so funny. because because the thing about that. date that show is so 90s. that they did they they can't. redo the [ __ ] theme song you know i'm talking about so now even in 2018 it's the the song comes on as a 90s dong dong dong the bass through. we're for short first of all. it's a bunch of [ __ ] white guys doing the instruments. and that guy comes in it's a [ __ ] it's a black guy who's six years old. that has a tan buttondown shirt. and you just go and he just hits. his [ __ ] powpow that simony is tinted. glasses like like john clapping. a movie like them i need those law. & order theme song law & order. theme song doom doom doom doom doom doom here we. go this is the theme. song this is it come on baby. let's play babies it's not playing here. we go is it. not it's not doing it. is it plugged in one. fire is it plugged. in it's not doing it. one fire god dammit what a [ __ ] would have [ __ ] you know those. porns were they were there. jerking that guy off. and then they stop when the guy has an orgasm whether. they call it ruined. orgasm that's what this is look at this. one's called eight hours. of lauren order theme. it was on mute why. was it on [ __ ] goddamn you here we go here we go. here this is so 90s. [music] that's the black guy that's the six. years old with a tan. buttondown shirt every time i think of people recording. music in the studio i think there's one black guy. with a tan buttondown shirt. you 60 years old this. is the most ninety [ __ ] this is like it will be this would be like if there was still a show that like a sitcom where people turned. around to the camera. and smiled and then freezeframed and then it showed their name eight hours. of this who [ __ ] uploads this right now what if you were on what if you had you know the shuffle it's so hey this is why i don't listen to. [ __ ] my ipad when i have sex with my i wouldn't have sex because then it'll shuffle and and and you'll be like oh yeah and it'll be like [ __ ] some really dope [ __ ] by genuine and then all of a sudden you'll be mid stroking you're like oh god hold on let me move i shouldn't put it on shuffle and then she's like oh yeah change it oh wait never mind then the base comes in she's like never mind it's kind of funky [music]. that's uh yeah so anyway uh yo this guy i was watching the [ __ ] by the way what kind of all over. the place but what the [ __ ] was i looka man. mon drop who's the guy. who [ __ ] i was watching a sword in scale which you know i like that podcast sword and scale luca. luca mandra it was like lucas. something luka magnotta this guy. i gotta watch this guy's i got to. see everything on this. guy because he was like this. gay model that did porn and then i don't. know if he did gay. porn or what but he ended up he was like so narcissistic and selfcentered. and then he [ __ ] he like would torture cats. and then he [ __ ] killed a guy i was listening his sword and scale and do it it's like [ __ ] so [ __ ] up he he put an ad out on craigslist dude craigslist is insane still how its 2018 who's still using craigslist that's what i want to. know there's millions there's billions. and billions of apps there. more apps there are billions and billions of apps. there are more apps than the follicles. on my hair on the follicles on. my head and if you look closely. at my head you'll see billions. and billions of follicles on. my head so apps start as companies and they meet in northern california and they develop what is known. as an app and then billions and billions of companies will have more and more apps. but yeah so this guy has puts out an ad. on craigslist and he's like hey just want. just for one i had something like want. to take pictures of a guy. and just want to. see it was like a real vague thing. because like i want you to. i have some some [ __ ] i want you to. do and he was like don't want it's not for pay. this is just for fun. and a guy how about that's basically what the ad. was and the and and a guy responded yeah i'll do it. i mean what the [ __ ] that's how you know there's too many people out there. there should only be a hundred million people. there shouldn't be seven billion if a guy can put a rant. on a random [ __ ] craigslist ad. hey i need somebody to. come over and do some [ __ ] for me. just for fun no pay. and some other random guy will be like i'll do it. who is he [ __ ] michael caine i'll throw it i don't care. what it is as long. as you film it i'll do it. so luka magnotta which sounds like a [ __ ] alias to. a superhero or a villain. i guess the guy comes over. he's this asian guy he comes. over and luka magnotta ties him. up blindfolds him and the guys. just chilling with his dick. out and then luka magnotta [ __ ] stabs him with an ice pick over and over again cuts off his limbs severs his head and then and then [ __ ] and then has sex with it yeah dude like real fuckedup [ __ ] and then uses all i did was here the reaction videos to. it i didn't see it. but i and the in sword and scale it. was showing like it was playing the audio. of the reaction videos and the guy. they're like oh my god he's using the guy's hand. severed hand to jerk off. himself off ah god first

believe how many people were affected by that fire to. be brutally honest remember. on to be broiler mom. people are [ __ ] friends are leaving their houses. it sucks god how about those far. from an imagined being in there. and [ __ ] fighting those flames. and [ __ ] and just being shh oh my god. what does it take for a man. to be a [ __ ] fireman that's crazy though. they have the shortest life expectancy. out of any job. probably i heard something like well. first of all it's been 80,000 acres. which is like insane and second of all. 80,000 acres and then also it would go a second. an acre a second would would flame. up an acre you cannot run. it like you do just see it. coming and you and you die. you get burned alive what worse. way to go do it. i yeah that's a 31. people have died so far. sad [ __ ] man these fires are [ __ ] crazy it's so crazy that they have like we don't have to. worry about like tornados and [ __ ] [ __ ] like that in la we had the word about earthquakes and fires fires bro i don't that's [ __ ] sad man i was had to. do this benefit i had to. cover for whitney because she was trying. to save a giraffe. and i went to. she was like can you do. my spot at the improv. i'm supposed to. do a fundraiser to. try to raise money. for pit bulls and i was like alright i'll do it i'll help. you out and i was like ah help. pit bulls and i'll help she was like you literally i'm in the fire. saving animals so if you do this for me you'll be saving my ass and you'll also be saving animals and i was like you know what dude how could i not do that after i look at now let [ __ ] 12 pigs die. instead so i so i went to. do the thing and i was like i got to. go first go still had to. go to my family. i had to meet up. with my family i had a [ __ ] family obligation. and i went to. go do it and they played these these benefits. and these fundraisers that they do. for comedy shows it's always it's good. cuz it raises money. but anytime you do fundraisers. or benefits or a comedy. show it's always for it i mean. 90% of the time. it's for something sad. so like you'll be like they'll play and they'll play a video. ahead beforehand and it'll be like this. one were pit bulls and i was like god in loving. memory this pit bull. that died because another an owner. tried to have it fight. another pit bull and then oh like this people have negative. stigma against pit bull. because it's fearbased you know. and this and that and it's you know. exacerbated in the media and i get that. you know like pit bulls are [ __ ] swedish. it but
