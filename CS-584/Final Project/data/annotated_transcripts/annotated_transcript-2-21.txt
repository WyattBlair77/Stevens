ferguson. i don't like the name. ferguson but uh i love i. don't really like the name. rebecca either because i don't like the name at all honestly. rebecca ferguson is a bad. name especially because

no no no dude he clicked on. what what oh he clicked on. one he started watching. and dude he took apple. tv suggestions he did what. get out of here dude. he did me i did. and i clicked on the show. foundation oh forget it dude. i clicked on the show. foundation how come they can make shows. that i didn't even know. existed for three years what dude. nobody knows any of the shows. anymore i swear to. god dude i saw a billboard. i was driving down sunset boulevard. i was driving i saw a billboard. for um um uh uh stranger things and it said the one. of will go down in history one. of the quotes will go. down into history as one. of the greatest shows in in of all. time and i was just like dude. hey let's not act like people. are gonna forget about that. show once it gets off. the air right that show. is and now i'm not saying i'm not saying good. or bad i watched the first season. i'm and i'm like okay. you know that's what i do. i watch that show i go. like this okay everyone flips out about it. i go like this okay. i know the actors in there. are good i know they do good. jobs the story whatever but i'm just like okay. when i watch that show. okay um but how can a show be on they're doing. a season two so it's not that. much of foundation but how did i not know about it. i i clicked on the trailer. of the show foundation apple tv. and i go like this. let's take i go like this. okay now you know i side. eye it right because every tv show. is trash pretty much. nowadays and every movie is even more trash. but i don't really watch the movies. i watch the tv shows. and sometimes i watch the movies. for fun and you know. for [ __ ] to. giggles as jokes right because there's really no good movies so i watch the trailer to. the foundation and i go. oh i'm in i'm in why. two things two reasons why i'm in first of all there's one actor i recognize. and this isn't one. of the reasons why i'm in but i got to. talk about this first how are you making a show. with the guy the only person i recognize. in the whole show with a crazy. ensemble i mean this. ensemble is so insane it's about a dystopian let me ask you a question. how come what's up. with shows about the future. i would say 95 of the show. is about the future. the technologies off the charts right they can do they got like hover cars. and like uh wow i'm going. on so many we i got so many tentacles. here i want to. go back to cover cars. remind me about hover. cars ivan but so why are there so many shows about the future. i'm talking about 95 of the shows. about the future where the technology. is off the charts just crazy. ridiculous but still everyone's [ __ ] dirty like dude you could just walk into. a room and think lights on the lights. go boom welcome bartholomew because there's so for some reason. in 30 years everyone's got weird. [ __ ] names right. welcome brother dave you know and you walk. in and you go you think lights. on but still you're walking. you got [ __ ] stains all over. your face you're dressed in rags you look. like kanye west just got in fight. with a cheetah like dude make the [ __ ] clothing biotech make the you know what i mean make the clothing this [ __ ] too i got the incels barking because someone's showing up. the dogs are barking but like why the [ __ ] are the shows so bonkers rad. and it's like ever people like can literally see their shopping. list their grocery list. on their eyeball in the inside. of their eyeball they just go. oh well we got to. go to the grocery. store let's check out what the girl. what we need let's look. at the list i wrote and they just go and then they go i want. that i want that i want. that and then it just shows. up through a shoot. from the grocery store in. the kitchen island all of a sudden. you got a jar of mayonnaise. and some triscuits but they're still dirty. as [ __ ] dude and they like live underground and figure all of it out. so i don't like about these dirty future. shows it should all be like demolition. man clean as [ __ ] cool. as [ __ ] they are in the tight. outfits flying cars here's the other thing. i don't like about the star. wars stuff and the and the all this. all the this show the foundation. hover cars that's that is such a dated thing to. have on a show about the future. dude if there were gonna be hover cars. there would already be hover. cars hover cars are [ __ ] and let me tell you why okay because dude they don't even they're not even off the ground that they're off the ground as much as you would have wheels on a car why do you need you don't need it if you go make a flying car make the car go all the way up around everywhere the hope that [ __ ] [ __ ] off with that i don't like that have the car either have wheels or it flies completely that's some [ __ ] [ __ ] hover cars just in a dirty i gotta brush my teeth outfit so i watched this show the foundation because of two reasons all right now how can you well this isn't it yet i'm not going into. the two reasons yet how the [ __ ] can you have a show how the how bro how much money do they have the apple i. know they obviously have a lot. of money this show's got a cost. it's gotta cost eight million. dollars an episode okay. there's ten of them. say it's 80 million dollars. say it's not split that. 40 million dollars five million dollars. to do each of these shows. it's got to. cost more but let's say it costs 500 so 40. million dollars are spending on this. dude the only act and there's so many actors in it. there's there's uh this is how many characters are in it. dude it's about the future. with in a galaxy they're not. just focused on one planet they got like so many. different planets and actors on different. planets so there's like a hundred [ __ ] leads in this. show and just like every show. nowadays the white people are bad. right and any any person. of color is like a hero. no matter what there was actually. one person of color in the show. that did a terrorist thing. and i was like man. they're gonna get written up by hollywood. so how was the only person i recognize. is the [ __ ] guy from uh chernobyl the show which is so good by the way. and all that shows the same. color too it's all green. i guess i like shows. that are all the same. color even though i thought i didn't um but so i'm watching this. show and i watch i watch a trailer. and i go like this. am i gonna watch this. and then i see yeah i'm gonna watch it. for two reasons why because of the guy that sent. it he looks [ __ ] radish [ __ ] and when you look that rad. i watch a show and the guy's name is. lee pace okay now let me. look him up because lee pace. now this guy okay so look i'm watching this. [ __ ] show because of lee pace i don't know who this guy is but i watch him because he's got he looks like i've got a really angular body. and he looks shredded and i love it. and he looks like a guy he's got cool. long hair he's basically like a super good. looking version of me. which kind of sucks. makes me feel insecure but dude. and i know he's tall. because i can just see it. and i i'm like this guy this. sucks right this sucks. and here's the best looking kind of guy. the guy that looks like he would be dope. with a beard that doesn't even have a beard. this guy is so handsome that. he's like you know what i get how i'd look with a beard. i'm actually not even gonna have. one and he's clean shaven. he's so handsome that that beard. looks like it's trying. to come out right. like he's got a it's not even a five. o'clock shadow it's like a 1. 30. right like he shave it's like 11. 11 a.m he's got just peeking out 11 a.m that just wants to. start bursting out they go. i know five o'clock hey at the 11. a.m hair in there is like that's five. o'clock somewhere right hey there's different time. zones though aren't they. their hair trying to come out. just right trying to. come out yeah he's handsome. let's make him more handsome. that's what we want we want. to procreate so i go like this. i'm gonna watch the show and he's got the best. outfit in the whole show it's super. blue and it's just all armor. but it's nice and like still thin. but like he can he's mobile in it. and it stops right here so it shows. his cuts and i'm like i gotta get out. to the gym more. which i've been doing by the way. but he's got just enough. product in his hair and i'm just like great. thick eyebrows just a good looking dude. so i'm like i'm gonna watch it. because of him because i don't recognize. him so like who's this. guy he's a lead in one. of the show in the show that's cost. 80 million dollars and i'm just gonna i don't know. this guy come on i watch that and then there's in the trailer. there's like not dragons but like beasts. in it so i'm like a mullen. so those are the two reasons why i'm watching the show. when i say watch a show. and i'm watching this. show this guy lee pace. now i'm spending way too much. time talking about this show. foundation on apple tv but it doesn't matter. dude because this is where you come. for the hardhitting facts how congratulations. podcast is it of this. show to talk about for 10. minutes a show that's been on for two. seasons already not even good to. talk about it but that's what we do. and the cult's with me. my babies so i'm watching the show. and i find this show. is it's fine it's very hard. to understand because they just it's so mathematical it's about sounds. so like something i would try to. like write when i was 15. but like it's about a um uh uh uh a scientist. um they call it. like psycho mathematic history or something. anyway you can um predict. what happens in the future. with large populations because of math which is [ __ ] stupid honestly but i'm watching the show and so i find it's very hard to. understand like they start talking in all sorts. of jog it's almost like make it a little bit simpler. i'm a dumb i'm a dumb. dumb so let's get it. going so watch this [ __ ] and i find myself watching the show and every time this elite pace guy comes on i go like this yeah all right. you know i get a little in my feelings. about it just watching the show. by the way by myself just watching a show. trying to understand the show. and like the show but also this guy's he's got he's got it. going on too much. so i'm like okay so i watch another episode. and i'm just stuck with how good looking. this guy is and also he's a good actor and also he's british. so i'm like all right. i gotta look this guy up. [ __ ] it's gotta happen. i gotta look the guy. up so i look at who's on. the show i see his name. is lee pace and i'm like that. name is kind of cool. kinda so i'm like [ __ ] this guy's cool he's got a cool name so go to. his instagram i look at his instagram. he's got you know not. a million followers but a lot i find out okay he was like one of the [ __ ] elves that nobody knew about in lord of the rings or whatever the [ __ ] i don't know if his lord of the rings or yeah it was lord of the rings and i'm like all right okay so he's got some cool rolls and i'm looking through his instagram i'm like this [ __ ] has a great body so now i'm getting more pissed off again you can tell he's big so now i'm like oh [ __ ] and i see how he looks with a beard so i'm like this guy he's really really he's working my last nerve. all right but i'm on his side. though he's just it's unfair. with how good looking i think this. dude is and i'm like i wonder if kristen would [ __ ] probably like this. guy i go if he has a beard. probably [ __ ] be all in right and then i google him and he pops up and i'm like looking at certain pictures and i know that probably people are going to. be upset that i you know i say this. sometimes you could look at pictures. of people and you're like just by the picture. you're like is he gay. and then i google easily pace. gay duty tied the knot. with his husband last year. foreign so i go like this. wow and immediately i don't feel threatened anymore. now how [ __ ] up how [ __ ] up am i i'm just watching a show by the way i'm married he's i don't know i made this guy up in my head practically but i'm watching them and uh now i'm like oh i love it i love that he's gay because even i don't have to. worry about the [ __ ] anymore. and i already don't by the way. this is the [ __ ] that deserves an emmy for this. [ __ ] dude he's american he's playing british. i don't know first of all. i don't know he's not british. on the show the foundation second. of all i don't know. he's gay bro this. dude is killer how do i not know. two things about you they should this. guy should work for the [ __ ] cia my favorite actor skyrocket. we pay stan dude anyway. i gotta watch the lord. of the rings shows now because of him um guys good dude. i just want to. smell his breath you know. it's got to. be great talking entirely. too much about this. show and him obviously somebody send this. to him let him. know i'm a [ __ ] hugely paced fan god if he was straight. imagine but dude good for him. man good for him you know good. for him god the guy's just so. comfortable in his skin huh. that's the thing dude. you got to be comfortable in your skin. [ __ ] you gotta be comfortable in your skin. anyway the show's fine. it's too confusing for me. and i spend way too much. time talking about it but this. is the hardhitting facts. here dude speaking about going. working out dude. because the guy's got a great. body that's one of the reasons. why i thought he was gay. too if somebody's super fit and that. could look at him like oh are they gay. because you know gay. guys like to have be really. fit or really fat right. there's no in between gay dudes. really like i saw a gay. dude the other day. walking around and i knew he was gay. because the way he was walking right. was like he was bigger. but also he sometimes gay. guys with big stomachs walk walk like proud about it. with the tummy out you know. like they walk into. a [ __ ] store in the tummy. gets there like 0.0001 seconds before them. i know that's kind of true. for all of us but these guys tell me. got in a little bit earlier. than my tummy would even get in right. um and he had a middrift or whatever. they fought crop top i don't know what they call. it but his tummy. was just out and it's like okay. we get that you're proud and you're working. it but also get a longer. shirt or lose weight. you know right like don't be both. don't be that big and then also have a crop. top right because then i gotta be like oh [ __ ] ah now i'm thinking about it you're infringing on my thoughts so there's two types of gay guys the real fat ones that like own. it and then the [ __ ] super fit ones um so i go i now i go to. the gym and i go. to the gym and you know that. right because speaking of lord. of the rings they need to. [ __ ] shoot the the prequel. tv show on my back. right and um i did deadlifts uh uh i've been using the hex bar. but dude i started doing the traditional. olympic bar or whatever the [ __ ] they call it you know and uh so that's about it it's about it about that but uh yeah i'm trying to. get that lee pace body. i wonder how tall he is. how tall is i look. it up how tall. i gotta look it. up because of my not because of my ocd. but honestly i want to. look it up lee. pace height you you got to. be [ __ ] you got to. be [ __ ] me dude. he's six five you. gotta be this guy is the best. looking guy i've ever seen. in my life i i honestly. he's six i wish he wasn't gay. i wish he was out. there just destroying hey babe you're probably like a guy named lee. pace come come in here for a sec. you like a guy probably you could stay. there but you're like a guy probably i'm watching this. new show on foundation on apple. tv and there's a guy on it. and you like him well but i don't know if you're gonna be on camera. it's okay if you are but look oh yeah. well i liked him just the face. you like the face all right. okay well he's gay i know you can't. have them no he's not he's gay. and it's beautiful look at his husband. matthew foley well okay not all the good. ones but so you're straight as an is it. yeah look at him. hi calvin look at him. look at him calvin is that. his husband that's his husband who's also cool. yeah all right anyway it could have been your father. calvin so he's so good looking dude. and he works out he works. out babe he's so good looking look him. up with a beard um the whole [ __ ] podcast about this guy on my [ __ ] notes i have i i barely ever take notes on my notes i have handsome foundation guy speaking. of the lord of the rings uh they did is aragon from lord. of the rings he's black now. did you know that they made him. black for the magic the gathering. cards but by the way. you can have just lord. of the rings guys on magic. the gathering i don't know dude. that's what it said they made. aragon black and like the the they're up. in arms about it. wasn't it vigo mortensen who. played him yeah and now he's black so the internet's going. like is this okay. would gerard tolkien wanted that. is that the guy who did it. jrk jk are talking tolkien read. this him right jr. tolkien uh so uh that guy is black and i wonder. what jk jrk rowlings would have done. calling token would have done because that's fine. with me i don't give a [ __ ] he's an elf. or whatever the [ __ ] make him i don't give a [ __ ] make him have a penis on their head i don't care they're [ __ ] elves they don't know you know is aragon an elf what is aragon the king of many elves of man oh so he's a guy oh he's a guy okay well he still doesn't exist because it's lord of the rings so i don't give a [ __ ] make batman green um just don't make [ __ ] the the shonda rhimes show woman is black you know in history she was in history a white person but i don't care it's netflix dude they're gonna have a [ __ ] paraplegic by daredevil soon uh uh just blind. and also in a wheelchair. can't move stop evil doer. people guys like no and just [ __ ] jumps away. he says ah [ __ ] i don't even know i can't see or do [ __ ] really and just blow into. the [ __ ] um so yeah aragon's black so that's what's up they painted them real nice too like super handsome. they painted them real nice. like and uh it's dope. and uh i'm like dude. they're painting them too real. like they don't actually exist. you know i don't like when they paint. people that don't exist. too real well. i'm [ __ ] crazy bro i because like make him a little bit more cartoony they don't actually exist. you're gonna pay them all real dude. just paint a guy because here's the thing. one day somebody's gonna [ __ ] up paint. a fake guy so real that you're gonna actually by. mistake paint a real guy. and then that guy's gonna see it. they're gonna be like you painted. me and you're gonna get [ __ ] sued that's my likeness. right black guy who's aragon who in real. life looks like garagons but be like i want. money from that magic the gathering. pay me why is magic. the gathering in uh and having a lot. of rings people in it. too many crossovers right. won't be happy till anne. franks and xmen um and frank let's go.

red flag. on if somebody is uh not well they are. constantly changing their uh identity. which is that that person is doing that. like this is why a lot. of actors are crazy actors will be like super jiu. jitsu and then yoga and then matcha. like all they know although just eat like they'll. eat vegan and then they'll be like on a carnivore. diet it's like like charlie. hunnam probably does that [ __ ] and he's [ __ ] batshit crazy. probably and uh i don't know. if he does that but i'm just saying like these people who constantly change. their identity are [ __ ] insane. that's it and i don't know. i'm i don't give a [ __ ] transnot go. ahead b whatever i don't give a [ __ ] i'm just saying that. person sounds like a loon. not because they're trans because they sound. like a loon um so yeah i don't know i guess. you can be trans. and like women if you were born. a guy it's just all sorts. of weird also what about women. dude women are like man. i've been a woman all my life. and it's [ __ ] hard and i gotta deal with this [ __ ] and get periods and all that now you're just gonna come along and be the best woman. of all time like remember when caitlyn. jenner was on the cover. of the thing women of the year. it's like dude if i was a woman. i'd be so [ __ ] mad then again who gave a moment of the year time or who gives a [ __ ] you know i don't think it's a [ __ ] about anything is what it is here's another thing about look at this this is the best i've seen this too about this guy this guy is so so so funny he's also probably trolling i don't know maybe not but so funny come on dude internet's not good oh is that it's that black dude who's bald who has a really like dyed beard the thing when he was talking about uh he was talking about it with uh who's the one who used to. date kanye west that big. uh asked girl amber rose uh when he was like when she was like i'm a [ __ ] and he and he she was like it's okay to. be a [ __ ] and he was like it's amazing. that you think that way. this is great why won't this. play i'm pissed i'm gonna here we go. do you regret not getting. married no children. or anything no do you regret. you're married having children. now that you're older. well and i'm gay you're gay. yeah you don't look gay. oh you know you come in all. shapes and sizes brother so you okay oh wow. i didn't know you were gay. yeah i mean i just told you how did you become gay. one doesn't become gay one. is born that way does. god know you're gay i believe so you know wow. this guy can you make you that. way it makes you that way. my opinion you think that. god made you gay i have no you know. i i don't know the i'm not going to. be presumed to. uh why would this. guy go on this. guy's show you know you know. what's gonna happen plumb the depths. of the of the most high but yes i've i've been gay. as long as i can remember and so have you been with men. of course like sexually yes really yeah. all right [laughter] this. guy knows gay people exist. you know this is mindblowing. for you yeah is that because i never expected. a priest and a father of epiphany church. to be gay that you're you know. sounds like you're coming from the assumption. what what's look gay. man you know a switch. in and soft looking really wow. what do you call. stereotyping oh but it's called uh that's like if i were to. say to you well you're black where's your fried. chicken dude well he says [ __ ] i don't say at the house. i can't wait to. get home to eat it. really that's what you call. stereotyping oh but it's called uh that's like if i were to. say to you well you're black where's your fried. chicken i was at the house. i can't wait to. get home to eat it. that's funny bro so you know that's amazing. are you does you do. your congregation know that you're exactly. they do that is my blog and so you think that god. made mistakes ah this guy's unbelievable. dude this guy really is unbelievable. um that's a big question. um wow that is good talking. about everything that is that is involved. at the not only at the bottom of this. universe but whatever ever what other uh whatever. other inner universes exist. so i would say that. um how do you know. i don't think actually that force that. we call god makes mistakes. no dude how about this. is hilarious okay let me. tell you why no children. or anything no so this priest is gay. this guy can't believe he's gay. they're they're he's like i guess. it sounds like he's judgmental right. you know he sounds honestly. just simple but they're both. talking about god and it's like okay. but we can go further. and just not talk about this. because probably there's no god. do you know what i mean. probably there's no god because of how honestly because for real. because of the kardashians are here. and i don't want to. that's not a god really. put them there on this. planet to test me. and that's an egotistical thing. to say but this guy's brain. broke because of that that's hilarious. you know what the guy's probably. gay right this guy i want. to look at more videos. of this guy it's called the fallen. state is what it is um i've seen this. guy the fallen state uh uh uh amber. rose video here we go. here we go and it's like well. if going out on a date. with a guy makes me a [ __ ] then that's just what i'm gonna be i don't think going out on a date. mate you're slow having sex with different. men makes you makes you a [ __ ] how does it make you if you have sex with different women a [ __ ] maker oh wow isn't that amazing no it's bad but men shouldn't do that either though it's not i know that a lot of women think that he says isn't that amazing like like like like when he says it it's fact you know once i made you slow you sleep with a lot of women and then and then what's that make you see a lot of women a [ __ ] maker and she said oh wow is it isn't that amazing honestly that's how calvin talks hold on. that men get away. with that right but they really don't a man. should not be having sex. with different women oh okay. why not it's not it. doesn't show respect to. the woman who wants it. and then he should correct her. because the woman doesn't want sex. with different men but what's the difference. between a man. and a woman besides a private. parts was it different would you say what's really the difference. right what is the difference. we're both human right. so if i want to. have sex i should be able. to happen i want to. have sex and i shouldn't be labeled. as anything because i'm a human. being how would you define us. personally define [ __ ] how do you there we go i i define it as a derogatory word that men and women use against other women to. put us down for our sexuality. and so you want to. take the shame out of that. word so that when women. do these things they won't feel embarrassed. by it but it's not about them. doing these things that's where you. you that's where the mistake. comes in right so this. guy just doesn't give a [ __ ] okay right because it's really what people think about you it doesn't matter actually what you do right so like if you're in high school. and a boy goes and makes a rumor about you that you did this that in the third. it doesn't mean you actually. did it it's what people think. that's true so now you're the school. [ __ ] that's true so that is true. regardless that's what i mean. you can be called a [ __ ] and not actually be a [ __ ] it's just a derogatory word. that people use to. bully women to put them. down for what they either. think they did or what. they actually did preach. um who is that guy. do you even know what his name. is n't that amazing. that's so funny dude. we gotta watch that part. again isn't that amazing. then that's just what i'm gonna. be i don't think going out on a date. mate you a [ __ ] but having sex with different. men makes you made you a [ __ ] well what does it make you if you have sex with different women a [ __ ] maker a [ __ ] maker oh wow isn't that amazing but men shouldn't do that either though it's not i know that a lot of women think that jesse lee what man is a that men get away with that right dude this guy savage moments are you a christian i am not you're not a christian now and where do you put yourself as concerned a religion maybe i'm multireligious if that makes sense no i did no is great this guy suffers no [ __ ] i am a person who believes in faith and goodness holistically amazing i've noticed that women today not all not all but most of the liberal women they seem to. be they pretend to. be tough but yeah when you see. these type of movements they are. saying that they're weak. you know they need laws and they accuse men if that's though. they don't know how or have the strength. to say no to. a man or to. walk away whereas when i was growing. up women were stronger and if if they didn't want. to do anything with you you. knew it you said okay. fine you know i have a lot. of friends i think um you know. trump has has do you think that trump. sells lies blatant lies. do you see that the president. is more transparent than any president. or administration in recent history no. absolutely not absolutely how is he. not transparent well why. the video own. up to the stormy daniels. story if he's transparent that's a dumb. man don't go there i mean. give me something that's a question. that's a personal thing give me something. and it's based in truth. somewhere and he just owned. the truth of it. that's shallow i'm not going there. with you that's shallow give me something. but it speaks about his character. though what does that have to. do with the president. when he when his character. is in question how is he these characters not in question. i'm questioning his character. the piece of questions and he hasn't answered. and the reason you're doing that. because you are a member of the family. of the children. of the lie are you christians uh i believe. in god yeah that said we're specifically what he wants. us to be i don't think he wants. to be called a christian. or jewish or buddhist. or anything he just he's not supposed. to believe in him. are you a christian uh i believe in god yeah i didn't ask. that i asked are you. a christian i believe in god you're not going to. answer that question well i don't know what. how i don't know. what a christian is i grew. up in christian church. i'll tell you that but let me ask are. you a christian so god. dude a dog with a bone. no you i identify like uh she's done. a lot of harm. patrick are you are you a christian. are you a christian i don't think so you can't. answer yes or no i i'm not sure. that's for me and god. to figure out once i mean. god we'll figure that out. this is insane you realize you sound insane. right now right no absolutely. not absolutely not i told you i grew up. in a christian church. i know exactly what christianity is. how do you know. how do you know. what christianity is when you don't. know if you're one or not well. i'll tell then you would know if you want or not so it. doesn't make sense i i then i'm not i'll say. i'm not you're not a christian. why is that so hard. to say well because the reason. i say that i'm not is because i don't think i live. up to the parameters. of what a really good christian. when you see i should know if you're one. or not the answer okay. okay well he got to. the bottom of it uh that's amazing. dude holy [ __ ] this guy's amazing. for some reason i think he went viral. again because everyone's hitting me up. saying you got to. talk about this guy uh are you a christian. i christian i don't know i cr so david i christian. he is so [ __ ] over every everyone just just sma saying so good uh god i would hang out with that guy um let's look at here we go um let's look at some some tenders okay oh oh god a woman says to. another no to someone come get that. assate respectfully mine respectfully would rather. eat your ass oh sweet. little man i can take care. of you love and then i say i'm not sure. you want to. i'm a hairy man she says i want. to enter the jungle. oh okay well it's also all it takes. all sorts right takes all sorts. of all sorts well. end of the jungle god that.
