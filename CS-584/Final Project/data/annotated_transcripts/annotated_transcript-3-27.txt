[ __ ] whole room smelled like a goddamn pomegranate and it's okay my baby's dude it's all good. man he wakes up and he smells pomegranates right. under his nose because of the trulies. and it's all good dude. he's got that crisp breeze and the sadness. behind the [ __ ] happiness and he smells a goddamn pomegranate in the middle. of [ __ ] peoria and it's all good my babies calvin. came with me kristen. came with me uh calvin's. absolutely killing it he's getting. tall and uh man you know. it's one good thing one good thing. about like traveling like this. is you know calvin's. growing up in los angeles. i guess i guess i mean. we're building a house like i said and we're gonna be [ __ ] moving a little bit out. 30 minutes out but you know calvin grows up in uh los angeles. and um it's hell on earth. or whatever you know because like you can just drive. a few blocks right. until you see something dodgy right. you could drive you could. go a few blocks before. you see something dodgy now. let's face facts so we're moving. and it's all good but i don't know. about calvin growing up. in proper la right. now we're gonna go to. the [ __ ] san bernardino valley. uh whatever it's in bernardino. valley you know in the 1980s. and 90s san bernardino. valley was the murder capital. of california uh and i know that. because i was watching [ __ ] city. youtube videos of cities so and to. dad and it's all good. but i was watching that. and then i was watching uh uh i'll get to. that later but yeah so we're you know. calvin's growing up in um los angeles. and it's uh you know it's a bit. of a [ __ ] thing because the second anyone is like okay. but what are your pronouns. to him like when he's [ __ ] he hasn't thrown. a football yet or some [ __ ] or have it. hasn't even thought of any real. life issue oh your boy's gonna go. ballistic and it's all good. well i don't want to. miss gen the second someone says i don't want. to misgender you and my and my son. has only taken about 350. 000 steps and that's it. i'm gonna go ballistic. if you're asking someone their pronouns at [ __ ] 150 000 steps your boy goes. ballistic and if it's blood he goes even more ballistic. so um yeah if you do that. to my son so we're moving out. to uh a little bit of a different. area and um but anyway that that i digress. because i was talking about it's nice to. go on tour with calvin because he gets to. see like [ __ ] trees with red leaves. on him you know. los angeles two kinds of trees. trees and then [ __ ] trees with no leaves okay there's just trees with some leaves and trees with no leaves but if you go to. [ __ ] back when the white woman originally said do you feel that red trees orange. you got bright yellow. shits right right before all the the fall turns. and all the treat the leaves. go down and hit the pile where some kids hiding and they get creamed by [ __ ] garbage trucks right that's what used to. happen when we were in you always heard that. urban legend about like don't. lay in the leaves. a garbage truck could come cream ya. and um so we so so yeah. so he's out in like rockford illinois. now of course bang. bang shoot him up he might get his wig. pushed back but it's a small. wig he's small so the bullets. probably won't hit him. okay they'll probably honestly hit me. anyway we were hanging out near. the [ __ ] uh lake or river. ravine or i don't know what you call. it because i'm a city. boy but um yeah so and i was like of course there's bodies in that wherever that body. of water is but he was looking at the geese. not the bodies and so but he was playing and he was like he went out. for a it was a beautiful. lesson i learned because he was running. to this uh well i guess it was an abandoned parking. lot it looked like a [ __ ] state pin but uh he starts running. towards it and gets smaller and it's already small. but he's getting smaller and smaller. or not like calvin and he turns. around i say come here. and he runs back towards me. a little bit and then stops and then kristen's like let him. go explore it's good for him. you know and i was like yeah. you're right don't say come. here just follow him and i was like you're right. so he went all the way. over to that [ __ ] abandoned parking structure and i ran. and i walked after him. i was like following him. following him like i'm a [ __ ] jaguar. or some [ __ ] like it's the movie beast. and he's idris elba and i'm just i'm just like tracking. him like i'm bear grylls and he's a trout and so um and it was kind of nice. though man i was just watching him. and i saw him get so far. into the distance and then he just [ __ ] came back and i was like were you exploring it and he goes yes i was cute. as [ __ ] man um so yeah so that's so it's nice to. be able to. travel and go to. these places because i'm gonna go to. i'm gonna hit some cold. places dude i mean i'm gonna be in chicago. and new york in february okay. and if you thought that was it. i'm gonna be in providence. rhode island in february okay. gotta get the cold days. because cove had [ __ ] everything up and it's hard to. get a saturday to. perform in because everyone everyone not only just you. know uh comedians also singers. and musicians and also magicians are getting. all all the [ __ ] venues so you know there's a lot of theater. acts now nowadays so um it is what it. is you know uh but yeah man. i'm really grateful and uh we'll be loving. it we'd be clubbing. um we'll be clubbing remember. that song from ice cube. we be clubbing don't. visit nothing wrong. get your club home he he honestly. i wanna i think rappers are. the ultimate when they finally get to. the like they start selling. like a white dad. you know like if if ice cube. rap that song we be clubbing. and he was a white dad. just like [ __ ] with just a tshirt. and like some jeans. on everyone will be like this. is the whitest song of all. time you know we just give these rappers passes. just because they came out of straight. out of compton he went hard. with that [ __ ] we'd be clubbing. dude thank you you. know what i'm saying somebody needs. to get [ __ ] kanye west some help. dude i mean i know i feel like i talk about this. guy every [ __ ] podcast but it's just like they kicked him off of instagram and it's like well because he's [ __ ] being antisemitic. and i get it you know. i think they should kick everyone off. into i think they should kick everyone off of every platform and just have splintered. platforms of like like what was that one um parlor like let them. just be there they want it. they want that let them. have that let them let the people who want. the freest as [ __ ] dude. not everybody wants free speech. on twitter people think they want free. speech until a [ __ ] comes after them you know like i what i don't get is kanye knows. the rules he knows. the rules he knows. if you're antisemitic can get kicked. off did he get kicked. off to twitter by. the way you got kicked off. of twitter too no no. not twitter okay so he says how are you gonna kick me. off of instagram you used. to be my nword and then he tweeted. this picture of him. and mark zuckerberg and mark zuckerberg has the microphone. you know and uh but it's sad. because uh he needs help. right how about that. that's all that's where it stops when you need somebody. when someone needs help. just get them help. kick them off everything. get him help did he get kicked. off of twitter too no. he did but now he's back. on they just they let you they give you a timeout for a little bit. they give them a they give them. a timeout for a little bit. they go what'd you. say about you because you can't. [ __ ] with did you don't [ __ ] with the jews. like the fact that i'm even talking about. it right now this podcast i'll probably be shadow band. yeah jews are killing it. we love the jews. um we love the jews. and we love blacks. and we love whites. we love them. all um and we love you. know what i mean we love we love [ __ ] trans. people and people who are short. and tall and all sorts of [ __ ] [ __ ] [music] now a word from our sponsor. betterhelp guys i love better. help all right um i struggle. with uh solving problems. within myself i struggle with solving. problems day to day and it can be tough to. train your brain to. stay in problem solving mode. you know when faced with a challenge in life. a lot of times the thoughts. become little by little and then it's like a big avalanche. of thought and you just need to. sit down and for me. it's hard for me to. do my day because of these thoughts. but when you learn how to. find your own solutions there's. no better feeling a therapist can help. you become a better problem. solver making it easier to. accomplish your goals no matter. how big or small. and i use therapy and because of that this struggle. has been greatly diminished. it is a beautiful thing. and i am such a proponent of therapy. and better help is the perfect. way to do this. um if you're thinking of giving therapy a try yeah. better help is a great. option it's convenient it's accessible. affordable and it's also entirely. online so you don't have to. battle traffic um or even leave your house. which is amazing you get matched. with a therapist after filling out a brief survey. and uh the cool thing. is you can switch therapists at. any time uh it's very easy so when you want to. be a better problem. solver therapy can get you there. visit betterhelp dot com. congratulations today to. get 10 off your first month. it's a deal for my listeners. go to betterhelp dot com. congratulations thanks [music] saw that i saw the new hellraiser. which is like um i saw the new hell rate. dude i [ __ ] did it you know me. and my ocd dude. me and my [ __ ] obsessive [ __ ] i watched the new hellraiser. and then what did i do. if you know me and you're a real fan. what did i do dude. if this is a crystalia game. show i saw the new hellraiser. and then what did crystalia do. a start watching all of them. from the beginning or b went. to bed if you guessed. hey yay dude i started watching the first. one and i just go man. it's like because i've watched the [ __ ] end the new one. on hulu okay i've never seen. a hellraiser before and uh well i used to. love that tupac song mama is a hellraiser. so i watched the hellraisers. uh new one and i'm like okay. all right right all right. okay so these guys can't tell the difference between pleasure. and pain okay and he thought. he wanted to [ __ ] he thought he wanted to. you know he thought he wanted. to have what happens. is when you [ __ ] move the block. around in the right direction you. get to pick what you. want to be your ultimate. fantasy and you can be pat. it could be power. love resurrection or sensation or two. other ones it's there's six choices. i don't know and they call them. like leviathan [ __ ] leviticus and all the shits. i don't know what it is. but begin with alan. the guy picked sensations and yeah [ __ ] like a clock went in the middle of his chest and it started making him feel sensations and he didn't realize that to. these cenobites who are [ __ ] jesus. i sound like a [ __ ] dork what he didn't realize is to. the cenobites okay okay uh pleasure. and pain is actually. the same thing and sensation. you know they can't tell the difference between pleasure. and pain so it. just makes me laugh so the guy. thought he was going. to have like complete orgasms. but it just makes him. laughs because instead you know they just put a bunch of strings. and um and like [ __ ] this contraption in his chest and they would pull on it and we're gonna make him feel pain. every few minutes and this makes me laugh. he thought he's going to. be [ __ ] absolutely busting um so anyway i watched it and i was like okay okay okay all right. i'll watch the [ __ ] for okay it ended and i go like this fine. dude i'll watch the original oh what okay. you got me dude. s m blood and guts and gore. all right you win the universe. i'll stay seated and go all the way. to the beginning so i turned on the original. hellraiser all right now before. i did that what did. he do did he a make popcorn. or b google the ins. and outs of every hellraiser. movie and also uh find out. which hellraiser movies were the best. and people explaining the movie hellraiser. in depth and reading a bunch of different. articles about that if you guess. b yeah hey dude chris doesn't make popcorn. because it takes time. and he wants to. eat stuff immediately so we need stuff. like pretzels and ice cream that's already. premade yay yay dude when he's really hungry. he gets [ __ ] pissed off because he has to. make a sandwich yay dude he'd rather just [ __ ] eat something. that's premade yay yay b the entrance. b worst cake joe of all time. so you god crest and so um wow imagine if you had it. i should have that game. show so anyway the answer was b. and so [ __ ] on our show today the answer. went a and then b and then so i read everything. and then i watched it. i was like all right. all right you really wet my appetite. articles you really i went. miami really you're really wetting my fangoria. appetite articles so um so i did it. so i watched the [ __ ] i started watching the beginning. i watched 25 minutes her eyelids. got heavy so what did. he do dude how well do you know. crystallia did he a go. directly to bed or b. watch another thing that wasn't so [ __ ] demonic so he could clear. it and then get into. a better mood and then go to. bed if you guess me you get it. you god crest worst game. show so so i did i turned on a little thing. and i went to. bed and then i woke up and i [ __ ] finished it dude. now finishing a movie like hellraiser. in the morning [ __ ] up your day. nice to meet you day. okay we're [ __ ] up good. catch you later now i watched it. dude now granted you. got to understand in the 80s. the graphics and the [ __ ] uh special effects they're gonna be worse some of them are going to. be better because they're actually physically. there and it's not cgi. but when they do [ __ ] like they gotta put lightning in or something or like the box. illuminates and they don't use actual light. and they just get some guy in there. to draw with a crayon. it's gonna look terrible. so granted take that. aside because that was just what the technology. was up to in 1987. the movie. was completely different than the remake. all right and i don't even know if it was technically. a remake but the movie. was completely different number one. and number two um it really put clive barker on the map. like clive barker put hellraiser. out and then became he was i guess an author. and then made hellraiser and then became a [ __ ] filmmaker. and uh it was way. more about snm and kinky. [ __ ] and also gore and it was way. different and i guess i i it's one of those movies i can't even tell if i liked or not because i'm not in 1987. you know i guess these movies. are okay right like if you go back. and watch freddy krueger now in the first. one or like jason. voorhees or any of these they're all. just so bad it's so hard. it's like watching [ __ ] laurel and hardy and trying to. get a cackle it's like yeah. then pushing the piano up. the stairs was funny in 1902. or if you're [ __ ] two and a half. you know calvin laughs at the big. wide oneword purple people eater. but i'm like i'm 42 dude. i don't know man i suggest. you watch it on hulu. and then maybe go watch it. with me man i should do these watch parties. on twitch is what i should do. honestly but whatever man i'm taking my pure spectrum. gummies my cbd shits right now. dude with you because i respect you. got a yellow one. dude i love these and uh you can go if you're a cbg guy. click on the show description and then type in congrats. you get 10 off of your gummies. i eat them and i just go. oh and um it's good. calvin has diarrhea speaking of the cabin. has diarrhea dude and he [ __ ] himself. four times and we cleaned it. up and it's all good. he rose with the punches man. imagine just having imagine just like isn't. it crazy like babies. just [ __ ] all the time from jump in their diapers and they don't really question it and then one day you gotta tell them like yo you gotta use the potty and they're like but this is a part of me you know what are you doing holding me over the toilet. and letting me release some of myself. into it then what do we do flush it. no that's terrifying that's basically. how razor in the toilet. i can't do that and i get it. dude but he's just [ __ ] himself. every day we [ __ ] ourselves every day for [ __ ] years all of us. and then and then we just use potties i guess. it's gross because it smells [ __ ] bad but imagine like finally starting to. question that as a twoyearold. you're like hey wait a sec. where's all this [ __ ] coming from you don't know it's food. and then knowing and then thinking like wow. a greater like something. greater than myself has really kind of fooled. me a diaper is a bit of a [ __ ] invention to. be honest like it's 2022. hey huggies. get it together you know. huggies been huggies for decades. hey pampers get it. together you're still [ __ ] all over like get a [ __ ] thing where a pill you could take where the you know what i mean where it just evaporates if you have a [ __ ] kidney stone you they shoot sonic waves into. your kidney and it disperses the [ __ ] kidney stone why can't they do that. with [ __ ] instead you just and huggies is like yo. we figured there man. talking to kristen the other day. and she's watching a makeup. tutorial and she's [ __ ] painting watching a makeup tutorial and i'm like you're 30. you've been doing makeup for over a decade. don't you know how to. do it why do you watch your tutorials as well. and she says because new stuff's always coming. out and i said what do you mean. new techniques and she says yes. but also new makeup and i said is it. makeup makeup and she was like well no because sometimes it's different. i'm like the technology. and the makeup and she's like yeah. and then you have to. reapply it in different [ __ ] and i'm like if they're doing that with makeup i can't huggies do it. you still got [ __ ] threeyearolds [ __ ] themselves give me a pill i don't want to. change a diaper i don't want to. change a diaper i'm tired of shooting in my pants. make it disperse please i just wanna. toot and fart every time. calvin too it's did you toot. no did you toot yes. every time dude why no first
