to. but man once every few months. if that really some restaurants. do this thing where they'll be like hi. how are you doing can i take your can. i take your drink order. and you're like i'm not yeah i'll have a you know. whatever club soda cocacola. wine beer whatever the [ __ ] and they'll be like okay i'll come right. back to take your order. and then you come back. and i'm like hi would you like to. take your order i would like to. take your order yeah i get the [ __ ] squash ravioli and the [ __ ] salmon or whatever the [ __ ] and i'm like okay now would you like to. order dessert because the desert takes 35 minutes to. make and if you want the desert. you can order it. later but it'll take 35 minutes to. make so if you know you want the desert. now in order to. the desert now

instagram see if i got some [ __ ] instagram [ __ ] and do i have wack chua. lee you know what i wow. i just remembered what happened. was [ __ ] ben affleck's back. tattoo you saw that dude. okay look i actually i like ben affleck. i think he's in cool. movie i [ __ ] i think he's good he's good director i i [ __ ] liked him as batman i know i think that's the unpopular opinion. but i thought he was cool. as [ __ ] as batman he looks the part. he's [ __ ] got cool gray. hairs that's how i think bruce wayne. should be i liked him. as batman okay go [ __ ] yourself but like and that back tattoo look who gives a [ __ ] if a back tattoo is what someone else likes you gotta like it fine. the funniest [ __ ] though was they were making fun. of it and he said no. it's just for a movie and then years. later they got a picture with him with the tattoo on i don't quite. get what is that part. on the bottom under the wing. that's not attached to. the phoenix also to. get yeah what is that. this is like a dildo. but why is it not connected. there's word breaks in it. yeah that is weird. but it's just odd that he got that. tattoo that's so big but maybe he did get it. for the movie and then just decided to. keep it but the fact. that he said it was just and that's that. was cool but the fact that it. dude i don't understand. this dude what's it for somebody to. say yo that back. tattoo sucks to me i go. i go i go in your face. i closed the distance. and i say bro. this back tattoo is the [ __ ] [ __ ] you don't know what you if that it dude guess what i happen. to think that back tattoo i happen. to think i don't i i think it's ugly. okay that's my opinion if if ben affleck. came out with a video that said hey you know i've been i've been hearing. about this [ __ ] about my back. tattoo i know a lot of you guys. don't like a back tattoo but i just got one thing. to say to. you guys [music] and then he takes his shirt. off in the vlog. turns around and does a [ __ ] and points down. to it with two thumbs. over his shoulders and then just [ __ ] and there's a little activation with his hips dude. and then he looks in the camera. it says guess what i have. [ __ ] some of your wives. probably and then he goes like and then he goes like this. and then goes good will. hunting and then [ __ ] it's over and then the next time you see him it's wrapped. around he got it [ __ ] more it wrapped. around his front no. [ __ ] ben affleck. right then would skyrocket my favorite. actor of all time talent wise. that's how hard i would like that. not just favorite actor talent. wise i'd be like he's the most. talented actor over daniel daylewis christian. bale [ __ ] the guy who played them in the movie. darkest hour gary oldman he's better. than all those [ __ ] dude i watched the darkest hour or i tried to. hey that's all i'll say. about that you figure out. if i liked it or not. buy this hey hey hey could we put more shades of brown. in that movie hey could you put more. bulbous noses in that movie oh could you just oh a could i make sure. could we make sure i can't hear a word. coming out of gary oldman's. mouth i get it good. acting and i dude. i it was he's good. gary oldman is honestly one. of the best actors of this. generation if you don't. think so [ __ ] you straight up but he is not better. than ben affleck if he gets a [ __ ] wrapped around phoenix tattoo all over his tummy. there's no way talentwise ben affleck. is better that's how it goes. um i mean i don't understand. why people don't see that's how trump that's how trump became president. you're damn right i'm gonna do that [ __ ] [ __ ] when it when we said you know what i knew he was gonna be president. when he said we're gonna build a wall. and you said everyone said no. you're not and he said oh yeah. as a matter of fact. i'm gonna get mexico. to pay for it. you know that i was that. meme of that [ __ ] of the dudes in the playground. that are like oh i was that. meme when he said that. one and i knew it. wasn't gonna happen it. doesn't matter it doesn't matter. when he did that [ __ ] dude when trump was like yeah. i'm and guess who's gonna pay. for it mexico and then the mexican. president was like no we're not and then and then trump girls. i guess oh that's funny. and then he should to. get a wall tattoo on his back. turned around and [ __ ] put his thumbs. up of his shoulders pointing to. the wall and [ __ ] wrapped that [ __ ] round his fat ass white tummy [ __ ] yo [ __ ] i'm donald trump head donald trump your orange obviously don't be orange why does anybody ever talk about anything about donald trump besides fact that he's [ __ ] orange i know that's a big thing out there we all know but why on earth does anybody ever talk about anything else besides the fact that our president. is a new race. oh it's cool but you're drawn by. matt groening you donald simpson dude. what a how [ __ ] is it to. fake tan as a guy. as a woman i get it. there's a [ __ ] whole industry for looking good with women. there is less of an industry for a minute. also the guys who do it. aren't even in that industry you're trying to. be a [ __ ] businessman you don't need to. fake tan what the [ __ ] he
