 yeah yeah and what you. do is you take it like it's a piece. of toilet paper that has [ __ ] on it and just like a bad experience you get [ __ ] over it you don't want to. hold on to. it because it's got [ __ ] on it and it's terrible and you put it in the toilet. when you're done with it. and guess what you do. you flush it and it goes bye. it goes bye bye poopy. experience [applause] [music]. [music] hello hello [music] voice exercises are coming. well don't say that i didn't uh. uh speaking of harry call it's cool. that gene hackman isn't. dead oh dude what's cooler. is on how much noise. our guest is making with this. and we just started we literally. just started we decided to. be like mr bean. and he's wearing a tin. foil and what does the. hat say i [ __ ] up oh it says hat says quiet. hey matt stop swearing if you could only fargo thing. realize who's had to. look at his own. fargo hat um oh like you've never done. it dude sang why the bad. word before the time. i know but then when i do it. i go oops and don't do it. again you did it twice. so i didn't feel proper like. guilt you got to. feel shame and like really really get down. on yourself okay okay remove that. i didn't do this dude. yes you this was here. i didn't do this yes you did. i sat down and that was there. i sat down it was here. no no no no no no no no no no no it was on. top of your thing that you. didn't use oh okay. fair enough fair enough you know. what i'm saying it's not my fault. can't believe you actually granted. me that i was right. well because you were i don't i don't like lies. you know um so wait uh he has hat that says quiet. but let's actually bypass that. yeah chris i know where you want. to go with this yeah go ahead. that oh he texted us he goes damn. gene hackman huh. did he die and he goes. yup he says yup. and then five minutes later. oh never mind he didn't die. so maybe we could learn start. that start the clock start. the clock so it's like and then we were like what happened. and he was like my friend told me. he died no you said well. we said what happened. he said he died. simple as that no i said he'd oh he died. yeah he said yeah yeah then he said 10. minutes five minutes later uh he didn't die. well only because i i was like i googled it. and there's gene hackman. and it's like the literally all the headlines. were like gene hackman looking. alive and well when he's like 93. and he looks doesn't even look. like gene hackman he looks like a character. in beetlejuice you know. and they're like he looks great. yeah yeah yeah so why. did you say that he died. so what we want to. know is why you said that. he died when he absolutely didn't. die what is it about. when people die people want. to tell everybody though i don't know that's pretty pretty morbid. huh i don't they might be the first. to tell you go out. of my way to. not do that sir. mixalock died because i don't know the person. and it doesn't really matter. because everyone dies all the time. people die everyone's always dying. a little bit more every day. or they're literally dead you know. what i'm saying sir. mix a lot died people. will mix a lot. died so i'm gonna text. you yesterday oh absolutely yeah. he was alive and well and then he just goes giddy up. you turn oh and died. what's up death what's up. wow um what's up heart. attack what's up did we ever learn. no why did you say gene hackman. died because my friend texted me. that gene hack why did why. did that friends say that. no no i'm gonna before. we even get into. that why did the friend. say it okay because they saw go. ahead they saw it before. we get into it. and he goes into. it but okay go ahead. well no no i don't want to. say it it's okay my friend texted me. whoa gene r.i.p gene hackman. okay and didn't look it. up and then i admittedly also did the same. thing i texted you guys without even looking. it up actually i texted you guys. and then i went on twitter. and i was like this. is weird nothing really what he did. so but i did it. faster and with more efficiency and with more. questions what i didn't do. right is spread misinformation right. so why did that person do it. this is what he didn't. even ask why that person. did it right well how am i supposed. to know that here we go. see that's what i knew. about it that's what i wanted. to get into i knew. you didn't ask your friend. hey why did you say that. what made you think of that. right well why would i say why. did you do that i know. my friends well we asked you. why but so wait. hold on that's crazy. somebody text me hey [ __ ] uh hugh jackman. died i go oh wow. and then look it up. it didn't happen i the first thing. i text is yo why. did you say g. or uh they obviously made a mistake. and so did i oh obviously the difference. is what that you would do. what you would vet it first. before passing it on after. i realized it didn't. happen i'd say what the hell. made you say oh oh i didn't even understand. that yeah that's what you're saying. you found out it was not. true and then didn't tell your friend and i knew that because i know my friends. oh i did you were not. being that clear i don't think he understood i didn't. understand why did your friend do it. uh when somebody makes a mistake. like that they say whoa. i [ __ ] up and i i don't say hey why did you do that. oh you didn't do it. so he didn't do it. he's like somebody just unbelievable. how many twists. this was like an m night shyamaha movie already. and it's been five minutes. i have one question it keeps getting answered. different ways so annoying. though but good yeah. i guarantee the answer here's why. i guarantee the answer is abundantly. clear it just hasn't been said by him. okay go go go go. go go did you ask the person. what made you say that. why did you think that no. no i knew that too. so why did you ask him. that's my point you don't know. that he i knew it. before he said you know. what i'm gonna do it. right when i woke up this. morning okay right now what okay. now it's 48. hours later i still want. to know the french litter are gonna. be like what i never did. that you know this is one. we're talking about one thing. if somebody were to. tell me hugh jackman. died and i said really then found out. he didn't the first thing i would ask that. person is what made you say. that yeah it's different. then what then saying why did you do that. the same thing it's the same. thing it's the same thing. it's getting at the same thing. it's like they saw a tweet okay. okay so you do know. i do know how do you know. well you told me here. we go here we go. what's happening right. now they told me. i mean i knew that was coming. right now they shared with me. what they saw that made them. do that for real i honestly. what is happening uh i'm gonna show. you what this tweet is i wish i could care. defend him better you know. what i mean but i can't. no he's it's indefensible yeah. this is the tweet okay. rip gene hackman your life. wasn't just an adventure it. was a poseidon adventure note. to self make sure gene hackman. is dead before you tweet. there's also another gene hackman. movie besides poseidon adventure very stupid. joke and anyone who read it would know. that gene hackman's not dead. yeah i would read that. and be like who's your friend. it's just i i would read that. and i go uh gene hackman. didn't die they yeah. me too obviously only read. the first part and then thought whoa. gene hopkins dead you know. what this is a testament. to how likely it is to. be [ __ ] when you hear something. third or fourth hand yeah. like how easy or rather. how easy it is to. like a total untruth get into. the slipstream and everyone's like did you know. you know john goodman died. me just me saying that. right now there's gonna be people like john goodman die. yeah yeah and that's i guarantee. you you know what i guarantee. is that this we're recording. this on wednesday. it comes out sunday gene hackman's. gonna die between wednesday. and sunday and so john. he's going to make it. even more confusing yeah yeah. yeah um should we even. release the episode all right yeah. well gene hackman is alive. john goodman is alive wednesday. this is by when wednesday. hugh jackman gene hackman. and john goodman are alive. it's wednesday do you ever think about. uh how hugh jackman's name is almost huge [ __ ] no you've never thought that it's actually not almost huge ass. it's about half the huge yeah. yeah soul yeah you're just out. of that soul it's actually twothirds of the way. there huge [ __ ] instead of hugh jack come. in so it's all good. though it's still true but if you drop two. syllables and just add soul. yeah huge [ __ ] yeah yeah you know yeah oh i know but oh you got too many iced. coffees yeah but they're off. camera nobody can see so you exposed me. okay well i'm happy so you've been exploded. so you've been exposed now explain. it's a really boring explanation. it is boring what the [ __ ] how could it be riveting there's two because who comes in like this. with two iced coffees. i didn't come in other than a maniac. one was here because chris ordered it. for me oh kind man. and one was here because i brought it. because i had it kind you're a kind man. that's good he's just surfing twitter right. now oh it was tam. okay tam i texted a huge group. chat about his death. then finished reading this tweet oh well yeah well at least. she came clean you know. thanks tim no. all right well that's cool. man thank god he's not dead. i guess i mean he is nice sent. me into a tailspin but at least she came clean what they what what age. do you think is a good. age to be like all right. life's done way before 93. which is how old gene ackman. is yeah i mean 93. i think he's 93 right. he was the oldest one out of that. wave of actors yeah from the 60s. and 70s uh like he was already in his 40s. when he did french connection. which is like right just exploded. which was 1925 so yeah. what is that yeah i mean. he's 90 something if that's the case. because that was in the 70s. yeah yeah yeah i s yeah. wow that's crazy man. wow but what why what do you think i mean. i think after 80. you're just like so slow but you probably don't want. to die so i don't know. yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i don't know. because like after 80. people start to get really like yeah. like you know like for sure. yeah yeah it's unavoidable. but and then there's was that there. was that guy who was that. guy lee haney that would lee. haney the bodybuilder no not lee. hayden oh wait who's that. i know who that is look. up jack lalanne jack lalane. uh wait was he like on an infomercial. or something

wasn't that. he lived to. be that old it was that. he could do so much. [ __ ] while he was like 90. like he did all that working out. stuff at the smiling pics. of him dude yep oh there. he was he would do like 50. pullups right there it was crazy. dude i mean i don't

right so let's do a video huh. hi guys need some advice. um my cat has been going next. door to my neighbor's. house who has a bird sanctuary. and scaring her birds. that neighbor came up. to my door this morning. she's a mid60s you know. typical karen and she said she opened with us do you know millions of birds. die every year oh my god i'm very confused. um she proceeds to. then tell me that. if my cat is found on her property. again she's going to. take her to. the pound oh so i guess. my advice would be it's how do you deal. with parents because oh god they're just the worst. yeah thank you bird is. their birds are caged i mean they're obviously not just no. it's a bird sanctuary. i think they're not well they're not but then they would just fly away. right no the bird sanctuary. is a place that they come. roost mcness so she just has a house. birds actually by where i live it's just open and it's a place. where birds okay so i understand. that but also it's our house. i mean i think it's her. yard i don't think it's inside. her house well it's not in her. house because then they would it's on her. property right it's on her. property of course they can fly away. but they come back is the point. okay so if they can fly away. then what's it matter. with the cat being there. more but what i really think you should do. is just to. like end it say if you do that. to my cat we're gonna have such an enormous. problem that you don't want and they can say well. why are you threatening me. you can say why are you threatening. me yeah you know. like i just don't do that. because we're gonna have an enormous. problem do it from the standpoint of like concern. though be like if you do that. to my cat there's going to. be a huge problem right. now there's a kind of a limited. problem that we can fix together. as two neighbors as people. start out by saying do you like limited. problems like jacly lane. yeah like an infomercial no. but for real like you don't want it. to be a bigger problem. either and you know she doesn't oh god so just be like look it's it's gonna become such an enormous. problem for you if you do that. that neither one of us. want that to happen so don't do. that just come and get me. and we'll figure it out. you're like oh [ __ ] man next time it happens i'm a little bit worried about this. big problem that you've just started it. sucks right it sucks between. me and you it just [ __ ] sucks you opened up pandora's box. now this is rough because i don't want i don't want this. problem and you've just kind of forced me. into it so now it's like you threaten. me no but so where do we go. from here you do it. what if you did that for real. it would be amazing. i mean amazing i would also recommend. that but it's hard. to pull that off you gotta be a good actor yeah. uh and i am okay. but yeah say i'm not i think if you do it. before the she does the bad. thing it's way better. you're operating from she already. did past tense no. she didn't get her cat and bring to. the pound no oh i i see. what you're saying yeah so it's like it's but the problem. is already created because she said hey she threatened her. no no but you as like the bigger. person before it happens. you can say let's snip this. in the butt because it's gonna become a huge problem. and i don't want that. well it's like the beginning. of the scene when the guy's like the karate. masters like being picked on by like 10 street hooligans and he's like just trust me you're going to. want to walk away. you know what i mean. please do do us all a favor. and just go when it comes. to cash and they slap you in the face. and then he kicks the [ __ ] when it comes to. cats and birds i'm a karate. master hey hey well you don't need to. go that walk away much. like the movie you know. lady walk away okay but you're missing the point. you're making it about karate. and i'm just saying you can take pointers from the movies. in this instance site what was that oh um dude. i think that uh you go you. say oh your birds can fly away. right and then she says yeah all good. catch you later spin move out. she didn't move out hey bro. wait hold on let me. google birds they can fly we're good. spin move you're out. ace ventura this part. yeah but it's true. though man other oh dude. cats [ __ ] well you know what dude okay i'm gonna fly so we're good dude but it's known. that cats kill birds. they do yeah [ __ ] ass birds. of all the fittest you want to. raise that's not a good argument sweetheart. you want to. raise weak birds my cat's doing you guys a favor. you get these strong birds. out there keeping them sharp. yeah like this oh dude. how about like uh um like uh what do. you call it uh play musical. theater kids like when you're in high school. they do [ __ ] like when they get married. what do you call. it you just describe yeah. whatever they call it. that's what you call. it you know in high school. and [ __ ] when they'd be mad they thought that was the thing. to do they'd be like you know. where did you go. to high school. cats at university absolutely crazy person. high school there was a girl when they get mad. go like this yeah there was one. girl that did it she would go. like you don't want to. piss me off you know and i'll be like oh [ __ ] man i i actually i mean so turned on no it felt so cringe. i was like oh jesus. i was in high school. yeah or college was it. like this big and had whiskers and a tail okay. yeah the cat it was. a cat oh cat yeah. okay uh i mean actually google. the birds fly yeah no no. uh 2.4 billion so [ __ ] many the united states alone outdoor cats. killer probably two wow that. killed 2.4 billion birds a year. how many birds would there. be if there were no. cats jesus christ though he birds. everywhere i mean that's such a good. population control thank you cats. dude bring up this. article the one the woman is over. at your place complaining and say look this. is nature this is how it's literally if it wasn't like this. the world will be overrun with birds. dude nobody wants that. yeah even crazy bird lady. yeah cats are oh cats. are crazy bro because they would they will kill. birds even if they're not hungry. they just kill them. they just go cats are just straight. up wild animals that can't. really kill humans so we use them. as pets like any. that's not true of most wild. animals most wild animals will kill us. that's why we don't have. them as pets cats. are just like small they can't. really really mess around. and they can but so but like cats. do not give a [ __ ] they'll kill. birds and like get it. almost dead and then just [ __ ] with it but way before like it's torturing it we need to. cancel cats cats are messed up. i mean i like cats. but like they're hardcore not. me wild animals no. it's the worst cats in musical. no i like cats the musical. no i saw it. it's bad okay i saw it. too it's good. so now what when did. you see it recently. when ever it was in l.a it. was at the pantages i went with him. i saw it then it was bad. it was bad no it wasn't dude. was it bad oh yeah yeah it wasn't like an amazing. production and also it's bad. all right next all right. yep dungeons and dragons. so um i'm a new dungeon. master and the dungeon master. is the guy who who runs. all the characters uh through the game of dungeons. and dragons and kind of controls what's going. on yeah so this requires me. to play a lot. of different uh characters that are in the world. of dungeons and dragons and um have. my players interact with with those. characters so uh my my request. is that you guys would hopefully be able. to give me some advice. on just voice acting in general. um and help me. be able to. potentially use my own voice to. create as many unique characters um as possible. and would love to. hear your guys's feedback on that. um second off uh this is a super nerdy. thing so if you guys could give me advice. on how to. not feel so selfconscious. about my wife um hearing. me in the next room uh that would be great. oh my god that might be my favorite. come here pretty you. know come in here foreign. [music] okay but i mean that might be my favorite submission. yeah ever because i started out i. was like damn what all right. so and then by the end i was like oh damn this. is good so complicated. yeah so dungeon master is what he's saying. right yeah so can you youtube. like dungeons and dragons. dungeon master like he's talking about doing different. voices for the characters you narrating. the game as dungeon master. okay and you're like in charge of tips. for dungeon masters holy [ __ ] but i've never heard of voices. being done i guess when you're in the role. of another character he wants to. embody them you know yeah. and uh that's cool. to be that committed. but like tips on how to. use your voice that is not. something i can uh help. you with uh but you know you're uh you're the man. of many voices you know. i got like six voices. here all right well what are they and how do you do them. so you got to. be like i well i don't know a dick. about dungeons and dragons. you just [ __ ] it's like we need a fantasy thing though but you it's like if you read a book right yeah you'd read most of it as action and narration be the quotes and then the horned devil. says yeah yeah exactly well you know. hello good good good good that's one. where is the princess here's the thing. though you gotta commit. yeah yeah right that's really good. i hope it doesn't find me. good job high voices. for girls uh the more evil. the person is the lower so here's the tip. that's true if you get to. a guy who you think is pretty. evil don't use your lowest. register there might be somebody more evil. later yeah that's good right. yeah but then when they're really evil. yeah that's that's right honestly. we gotta cut i gotta go. to the bathroom and i can't and i can't wait okay. okay all right we're back. and we're back yeah you gotta commit. to it though you got to. commit to it otherwise it's like you'll it's so the kind of thing. that if you don't commit. property all the time. it's like it's gonna seem like insecure. or like you that you suck. at it like don't bother. doing any voices unless you're going. to commit to it. 100 that's what that's that's what. i'll say the other thing. i'll say is dude here's the thing. it's hard to. find something for anyone during. their life that they love. so if you love to. play dungeons and dragons. don't feel like whatever like nerd. the nerd label is. gonna be on that. game forever it won't matter like but just embrace it. and say like who like who really cares. a nerd nerds are. popular now anyway like who cares. dude yeah dude there's a lot. of nerds yeah and uh find your nerd friends. yeah just be a nerd with like. no no shame there's no shame. in it even if what's in it. is dungeons and dragons right. dungeon master of dungeons i saw a little bit of that. movie that came out with chris pine you. know it's not bad oh wow. okay is this the movie critics. corner session of the show yeah. i guess so really really animated. welcome and really delved it. you really delved into. your opinion welcome to. movie corner okay yeah i just feel uh yeah. i don't yeah your wife already. you already she married. you married her you're good. bro you got the chick. well he's obviously understandably con. i mean it's a valid. concern just because they're married. doesn't it's not like 1910. she can she can leave the marriage. yeah but she's not gonna do that. because you're gonna be like yo i like dungeons and dragons. when she says something about it. be like park it i like dungeons and dragons. or don't be mean and say park. it or just be like be like yeah i like it. yeah it's really fun or be like this. yes i love it my pretty. yeah or that like i said there. you go whatever it is you're doing. you got to commit. to it and if that's the lane. you choose to go. down then do that too but yeah dude. you gotta look it. just is what it is. you love it oh and people love. it it's not it's a thing. to love just be one of the people. who loves this game yeah. who cares all right next. one this is about like i eat something. spicy dude what's up so my best. friend's video on this. because she's a legend. quick question that i feel like most people are thinking. but haven't wanted to. ask and it's really been driving. me crazy i love lifeline. i love watching it thank you. and i'm a big fan. and sometimes it's okay you know. to say life rips and as we all. do but i've noticed why. am i getting tearyeyed right. now i've noticed when people send in videos. they like you know when you watch someone so much you take on their manners. yeah yeah and so many people have done. that with you and i just need to. know you chris no and sometimes. matt i need to. know does that bother. you or am i a bad. person for being bothered by people i understand. people getting bothered by that. things or is it. like cool because because yeah i do know. the revolution of talking like you. but no us dude. let me be clear sure. but we created that. it's not just me okay. it just it got puddled on. my podcast obviously yeah so um uh yeah i i i does. it bother me oh a lot. of if it's bad a lot. of times people do it. bad then it's like but also it's it. doesn't bother me because it makes them. happy and i love making people. happy and when they do it. if they think they're funny. doing it which sometimes they are sometimes. they aren't but like i i have heard people fans. say that about other fans. uh and is it it's it's only bad. if it's bad if it's but isn't it all maybe i misunderstanding what's happening. but isn't it all in honor. of being a fan of yes. yes i i mean because what she's saying. she's if she's talking about fans. and i think that's probably what it. is i for me. it's an experience of people who know. me yeah will come on to. the way that but here's what it. is it's not just that. like it's not that like the way. of talking that either one. of us does is like people. want to like necessarily do. it it's just that i have come. to believe that some people talk. in very specific ways yeah and those people tend. to be like one or two. per group right. and people in that group. if they're gonna end up talking like anybody. they're gonna end up talking like the one. who's got a really specific strong. style yeah and and you know. look i'm very influential. and it's just you know. but i do understand. that and that's like when i hear people. say like you know other comedian. friends of mine that do this. like callan we sounded. like sometimes we're like oh he's trying. to bite you it's like dude. no we're friends like like jerry seinfeld. and and what's and uh larry. david they sound alike a lot. okay oh only one's more you know. swear wordy and one's not. but um yeah uh you know. i you know i don't know that's just like i think people talk. like i think what you're describing. with you and your fans. is just like an expansion of what. naturally happens in circles and groups yeah yeah this is just happens to. be a big group where the people. don't necessarily know each other yeah. so i think it's probably more pronounced when somebody speaks like you because it's like you don't have a right. or whatever i also think that when they're sending. in a video they're like i want. to do this that 100 so it. comes across a little more. inauthentic than you would in a friend. group but if you were just hanging out. with this person i don't think they'd be doing it. all the time you know. oh what i was gonna say. is when people call. in with videos they they do. it because they think it. not only that you'll like it. yeah as like uh oh compliment. yeah but like i think that they also want. to it's a it's a signal that. they are aware of you. and are a fan of yours. yeah yeah it's not just them. trying to be like funny like you yeah. if you look at it. that way it's less uh it's like a way. of commit uh communicating information. yeah but i do i you know. i understand there's there's there's uh people that want to. be a part of you know. the log cabin and [ __ ] and uh they want to. prove it that they want to. be part of the log cabin. and um you know a politician carpenters. we have carpenters we have chris. delia we have gardeners log cabin. we have uh uh people that are in responsible. for zoning wow and uh we will increase. expenses when it comes. to uh certain things of of that. nature so thank you uh very much um and it will. happen i i hear you. but it will happen. um just give it some time. thank you very much because excuse. me wow we're gonna go the whole rest. of the hour you know. all right cool so they think that it'll help. them get on the show really and it doesn't so oh wow. wow wow wow doesn't let me tell you one. thing it doesn't gonna fight. um but yeah there's there's different levels. of fans and i appreciate them. all and we appreciate them. all politicians uh really there's nothing nothing wrong. about it thank you. very much well nothing wrong. about it you know. uh what if there was a position. that at the end of every speech he said and there's nothing wrong. with any of the things i said thank you. very much excuse me i mean. coming no that's i know what you were. trying to do okay. who comes up but you went. like this i mean i don't know all right. next one right next one. hey y'all so i am currently. 36 weeks pregnant wow and my husband and i aren't finding out the gender of her. baby so i slide. the baby out and so with that we have to. have at least one boy name and one girl name picked out when we go. to the hospital or just like kelly. um with that picking a name has been all difficult. and i was wondering if y'all. think that there is any difference between naming. a dog and naming. a human yeah because there's some names. sound a little too funky. that i don't think should be put on a human. but then it would be really cool. to have that kind of name. like a funky name but i don't. want them to be made fun. of and say like you know. have some weird [ __ ] name yeah so they all think that there is any difference between human names. and dog names fido. and spot you know i i you know. like meatball you know. you don't go name a child. meatball unless you're really. famous you know what i mean. there is meatloaf so like yeah. but he came into. meatloaf there's parents weren't like and and good night. to little meatloaf you know. what i mean he came into. my man was like that's a meatloaf guy. um yeah i i i think that uh you there. are i don't you know. it's fine to. name your dog a human. name i think like that that way. of course is fine. but if you're asking if it's okay to. name people with butters things that people name. dogs i think the answer is absolutely no. no because here's the thing if you want a funky. name guess what else you can. use what a funky right. right right right right right. right like what like firestorm like well. no that's more just the now. that's a transformer it's a noun. oh oh it's a neighbor. transformer yeah i guess then firestorm or like uh blaze that's funky. blaze that's a terrible. name but yeah i mean blaze is sick. dude blaze is rad. it's also spelled blaise if you oh if you want. but if you want to. get funky you see blazzz. oh god blahs you know blaze blaze hey i'm bloss. blasdalia my name is blas yeah. are you supposed to. be blaze but they put three c's at the end. look like it just fell asleep. dude for real name. your kid blauze but threes and then forever. play him this clip. so that if it's a boy. named blas if it's a girl. named blasa blas is the worst. name i get blaza blasa. dude yeah yeah um remember that. song blase blase who made yeah songs about her. songs um yeah dude. don't name your son. spot or fido name your kid. blas don't he or she will. always have this to. look back on as such a warm. memory of how war memory. selected your video of millions. and millions of videos. and now we get to. name you go with god we love you. i think you should wait. till this uh baby. comes out look at the baby. and then solidify the name. like i we wanted to. name him calvin and then he came out. and we were like yes. okay calvin yes mike. that makes sense with william. he came out first we had a few names. in mind and we were like ah the day. like a day went by and we're like i think he's a william. you know you got to. let it speak to. you you gotta let the baby. speak to you you know. or you can do like hey kelly. morgan we don't know if it's a boy. or girl he comes out. she comes out it's gonna be that name right. kelly morgan whatever you wanna morgan what other name kelly morgan name your child kelly. morgan thanks what other names. are there kelly what do you mean. that are oh oh geez. uh kelly morgan kelly and morgan uh robin robin robin robin batman. chris tina christina no chris. or christina right yeah but christina for men. too christina is kind of a weird. name it makes me think of like it. was just a guy's name and then they just changed it. to a girl's name. i don't like that i like that. the most really yeah like bruce bruce ella. well no not all of them. but the ones that exist. are like george and georgia or georgia. and jordan georgina those are cool. names you know hey my name is hi. my name is bruce ella. you know wow um most the most annoying. voice that you just did when you were brucella. that is the single most hi. my name is bruce ella. it's like why i don't know. it's just like encompasses all men. all annoying male and female yeah. i'm a good one okay. well that's not what i was saying. okay let's do the next. one blast name of blast. so blind i have a question. blind i got invited to. it could have started the video. more blind so i have a question. and advice how come i can't. see i got invited to. a french bachelor party. and obviously definitely a good friend. but i'm running out of vacation. days i've already spent a bunch. of money this year i'm going. to a new york. giants game in arizona and just an overall expensive. year right and his bachelor. party is in september. i don't want to. go oh there you go. it's gonna be another 1500 weekend. yeah it's crazy and i've ran. out of vacation days is it. like a dick to. not go or is it. more dick to. make up an excuse why i can't go. or do i just be honest. and say listen man. i'm gonna have to. sit this one out just want to. know what you guys think. love what you do and let's see some advice. thanks guys perfect. use of this a dick. without being it being cringy. okay yeah i'm talking about. reference to the earlier questions. yeah reference to the earlier. question just came out just did. it is this a dick. or is it nuts. a dick all right. well here's here's the deal. and i mean this from the bottom of my heart. and i want everybody to. listen to this piece of advice. because it applies to. so many people so many different times i'm trans. and it's okay he's asking if it's okay to. not essentially he's asking if it's okay. to not do something right. and here's the answer for every question. like that okay yes it is completely. okay to not do. the thing whatever that is yeah. and this guy yeah size case. it's a bachelor party guess what. he doesn't want to. go he doesn't go yeah and everything. everything for everyone yeah right. vote for matt okay. the meters on the screen dude. i i couldn't agree more. man you know you don't need to. go to bachelor parties you don't need to. go to weddings. you don't need to. go to anything especially if it costs. [ __ ] racks you know what i mean it doesn't make a difference for me. but i get it dude. fifteen hundred dollars are racks. you know that's a rack and a half you. know what i mean and it's too much. money dude absolutely so disrespectful. to ask your friend to. come to the bachelor. party to get some freaking racks. you know wow you know to. spend rocks i spent rocks. i know you're going to. i know you're going to. uh the giants and new york. game and spend a lot of money. but you know hey by the way. could you spin a rock and a half. just because i want to. go get hitched and i want to. [ __ ] play poker somewhere dude. no this is why don't go. that's why i didn't want. to get into the specifics. yeah dude there's poker and all that. stuff at a bachelor party. but it applies to. anything yeah dude stop throwing the stuff. because here's the thing even if the person. asking you yeah to. do it even if they don't like it. guess what they respect it because they wish they could do. what you just did in their own. life time and time and time. and time and time again. they respect it okay. where's the baby give me. a baby to. kill the polls dude i feel like that is uh great. advice tell them do not make an excuse be like yo dude. i'm already spending that's an excuse. but that's an experience and then it literally said don't make an excuse. and then gave said say an excuse. no no i i meant don't make something up. don't be like oh don't lie. don't lie sorry yeah yeah right. correct yeah but be like yo. you know i i don't i can't. go i don't have the money. and also it's just not gonna be my thing. in september is a rough time. for me to do. it just [ __ ] can't go yeah can't go text back or on the email. chain reply all can't. go i mean then you're a dick. see then if you do it like that. you actually are a dick. but just simply saying the actual truth. yeah not only will feel good. and you won't feel like you're lying. which is obviously great but you will. be respected for it. all thank you very much. at the i'll see you at the polls. reply all on the computer. do entrepreneur on phone can't go in parentheses sniff send no can't go in parentheses don't wanna. yeah all right well that's the advice. for the ages we should just close. shop the show's over that's enough. is it's just i don't you know. even dinners sometimes it's like asking. your friends to go to. dinners where it's gonna be like [ __ ] 600. it's like don't do that. dude or pay for it. i mean totally pay for it. like yeah yeah that makes a difference for me. but it's like rocks you know just wanted to. say racks again no but it's fine. before i got a diving board on my pockets. right but it doesn't matter. dude because my pockets but if you feel so uncomfortable. to have the diving board in your pocket. just always in pain little people bouncing. off that diving board going. into the thing like ducktales. all right arnold all right. next one dude also bachelor party. sucker what's up chris what's up. matt what about this podcast. on the tube right. here used to. think it was congratulations. but uh the brotherly. banter just puts. this one over the edge. loving it um so my dilemma here. i just got back from an italy. trip this trip was planned. about five months ago. with one of my best friends. who's a girl um and two of my other best. friends a couple and we played it. five months ago. and then the last leg. of the trip um the friend and i the girl we were staying in the same. bedroom right um fast forward. to now i've been seeing a very special. girl for about three months. and um i had told her that we were staying in separate. rooms the whole time uh last night. of the trip literally the night before. i came back um nothing. all the whole time i was gone. just excited to. see each other um the girl in my bed. sneezes and the girl hears it while we're on the phone. and she goes who was that and i go. oh it was me terrible. call bad decision um really messed that. one up obviously uh but i said it. was me we kind of blew. it over i wake up. in the morning to. a text uh breaking up. with me basically uh we've been going. back and forth um she keeps saying she needs space. then she ends it. again and i'm just wondering what i can do. there nothing happened with me and the girl. nothing's ever happened with me. and that girl um i don't know. how to explain to. her i don't know if i've just completely lost. trust um she's a super special girl. girl in my dreams really so um if you guys. got any advice for me. to um help the situation get her. back smooth it over did. i just blow it uh let me. know appreciate you guys thanks. again for all the advice. and keep it up with the pod. don't hang out with allergic [ __ ] okay so moving on to. mine um it was a joke. i think so that it. was a joke i don't. even say that word i here's this. way man but it was wow okay. it was a joke. everybody we know she wasn't allergic. um but also what happened. what he was talking to. her and the chick and then the girl stays in the background. yeah and it was a chick. that he wasn't hooking. up with what the [ __ ] do you do on this. show i a little bit stopped paying attention. why it's an hour. dude it's a [ __ ] hour you can pay attention for like the 12 minutes. total of the video what happened. was ah i [ __ ] [ __ ] i checked out. for about five seconds and it was during. a very important part. of the video and i was lost. i got the rest of it. but it didn't all. right well he's good friends. with this girl yeah oh been friends. with her for a really long time. uh they never dated or anything. they never told the late the new girl. that he was gonna go. with the girl he did but he specifically didn't say. we were going to. be sleeping in the same bed. because he i don't know i guess. he knew she i don't know the same. thing oh yeah okay. so of course it did. is it better now yes okay. so here's the thing that's pretty weird. you i know what happened. now are dumb yeah. that was a dumb. for doing that right but i don't here's the thing. the problem is is that you didn't tell her. in the first place you can't. say well why don't you trust. me because you broke. the trust so now you're kind of in you're gonna. have to be playing defense. and you're kind of [ __ ] already but i think that look if she just outright doesn't believe you doesn't want to. talk to you yeah and that's that. you got to kiss a goodbye you can't. you can't do anything about it. for you you got to. say bye but if she's just like if she's willing to. talk to the girl who sneezed uh. anyone else who might attest. to your actual relationship. and hear it out. then you know maybe it'll be some kind of patching. up some sort of understanding. it's the girl your dreams. you want to. try to obviously make it. work but that's not always possible. and when it's not possible. you have to. let it go let's not let's not. negate how annoying it. is that that girl sneezed you know. what i'm talking about i get it. what he did was wrong. but oh my [ __ ] god do the thing where you do like this so in all of this. experience dramatic the the woman. who sneezed i'm not mad. at her but come on dude. but what about the guys. you [ __ ] lied and messed up. the situation for himself. in the first he was wrong. but also like this yeah yeah yeah i chew. you couldn't uh what no it's me. i put the phone away. and i just let me ask everybody's. high pictures ever been a time. where you couldn't not sneeze. in your life no are you you're lying. you know that's cool. but you're lying it's my body is. it bodysuit i'm never here. you are lying i've never heard more than once. i've never hiccuped more than once. that wasn't my question. even a little bit how the [ __ ] could you answer with that. i mean donald trump. you know i do not do what. i don't want to. do with my body okay. okay what do you mean. if i don't want to. see these i won't sneeze. so what if somebody took a big big yes sharp knife. yep cut you like this. what would happen i would bleed. because you wanted to. uh no that's different okay. well then continue to. explain cause and effect. you can't stop that but you can. stop sneezing because that's my body. i go like this that really is just a different. kind of cause and effect. their nose hairs got tickled and there's there. she blows dude like this. hms pinafore but i've never heard more than once. i've never taken more than once. i don't give a [ __ ] i bet. you do that how many times you've hiccups. it is interesting that i've done. that i'm talking about that. though what about the sneeze. but what i'm saying is if i go i go. like this i think about how it's my body okay. krishna murti in the meantime. twice don't know who that is but that's so [ __ ] dorky. you said that christian. mrt krishna murti okay our clothing designer. anybody who knows anything a clothing. designer outside of their own. little [ __ ] wool cuffs with big cuffs and gold like swirlies not exactly christian amarti not exactly all right um so it is annoying and that person who sneezed needs to. be held accountable a little ah. you idiot dude so sneezed huh. i've never wanted to. just pummel you maybe in my life. i want to. pumble you right now how wrong you are. to focus it on that. no it's just so simple. it's annoying that he was he was wrong. i'm not saying he was wrong. what i do is i look. at you're not saying you're wrong. i say he was wrong. but i look at the different. parts and the different angles. okay i look at the different. things every that person sneeze. that's very annoying as [ __ ] it is annoying as [ __ ] that that person sneeze. you can't fight me on that. annoying i mean unfortunate i would i would i would use the word. unfortunately would you not be annoyed. you would be annoyed. you wouldn't find yourself in that. situation i would be an annoyed. about this situation that i put myself in yeah. in the moment in like the very that. exactly what i want to. know is is that guy. like hey don't say anything. i'm gonna be talking about the [ __ ] thing you know. that's what i mean once. you lie you got to. be a liar that's bad. yeah the reason you don't lie. is because you gotta be a liar. you can't just lie once. you got to keep lying. yay matt wait you're saying. lie what you're saying lie. keep lying no no. no no oh yeah yay delia says lie. yeah um uh all right no. yeah you just you you put yourself. in a hole so if she's just gone. you gotta let it go and that's it. don't pester don't annoy you you triggered some trigger. that it was not okay. with her and that's fair. and you gotta let her remember her. mom when she was younger. died by his knees. all you can do is. learn the lesson of don't lie. about little [ __ ] that you're actually being faithful. about anyway yeah i know really the worst. [ __ ] it wasn't even a necessary. lie i know if you're not doing the horizontal. mamba with that with that other woman. why are you lying. about it why are you lying. yeah you just want her to. like you want her to. be okay and i get it. yeah i get it too and i get it. get it too but not everybody. i know everybody can't have everything. that they want to. admit that you yourself are not every single thing. that a person wants yeah. that's exactly right and i get it. more than that so next one. yeah okay [ __ ] we've had him so yeah what's up. matt and chris return caller here. i was inspired by the piano. guy from northern california with a veneer. teeth who had questions about hair. my quick advice is to. him hey dude grow your hair. out you don't have to. color it your hair looks great. you just make it longer. oh yeah and then maybe people will call you liu kang. for the rest of your life. thanks a lot anyway i have an update. about my whole situation. with crossroads the thrift store. right you can take my fear of god and kanye. west related related stuff because of him. not being a nice guy. yeah um that day. i'd gotten so frustrated. i did a bunch of research on the web. found crossroads corporate headquarters found some. contacts on linkedin contacted a lady. she ended up calling me. we had a fairly long conversation. about morals and values in society. etc and um she took some sort of managerial actions. um on the employees that. i interfaced with at the location. that i went to. so it overall was just a weird. thing it was a weird. feeling and i mean i don't i hope. that person like didn't lose. their job or anything. yeah and i don't want to. be in trouble for yeah. whatever it is that connie is up. to really quick before. i go i did have a quick. question about something that i could use some advices. on do you guys ever. find yourself throughout the day. measuring everything like the the the time. that it takes to. do stuff i find myself. doing that and my therapist says it's a form. of anxiety assuredly it is but it's one of those things. i'm just like how do i not do that. how do i just relax. and say it might take me. an hour to get here it. might take me two hours. to get here um it might take me. two minutes to. brush my teeth it might take me 30. seconds but who cares. you know how do i just live. my life that's it. really before i go though. sorry i lied. matt thank you for making me. that little birthday video. my sister convinced you last year. it was absolutely hilarious she. made me a whole compilation. and you were the cherry on top. so anyways guys thank you so much. love what you do curious. to hear your feedback. that's amazing so yeah. uh this guy overthinks a lot. of [ __ ] clearly yeah because that was one of his questions. how do i stop overthinking and just enjoy yeah. but but even the thing. that where he had to. call the person and they talked a long time. here's the thing that you didn't even. realize he was snitching. but he was just talking too. much but here's what happens. when you ask too many. questions you get somebody else in trouble. yeah get somebody else in trouble. you ask too many. questions that's true just let it go. he can't let stuff go. as his problem you gotta let stuff. go i know guys like that you gotta let stuff. go and let it you know. like toilet paper you wipe your ass. with it that it's got [ __ ] all over it so instead of holding on to. it guess what you do. you flush it down the toilet eat it. oh that's what we should do. with experiences right. we have good and bad experiences. but when we have a bad one. yeah it was a bad one. that i don't want to. think about anymore guess. what right it's got [ __ ] on it where's the toilet. first analogy put it in the toilet. bowl flush it hey where'd the memory go it's gone. uh we got only happy. ones oh i don't know who wants only. happy memories and experiences me. too what you do. is yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and what. you do is you take it. like it's a piece of toilet. paper that has [ __ ] on it and just like a bad experience you get [ __ ] all over it you don't want to. hold on to. it because it's got [ __ ] on it and it's terrible and you put it in the toilet. when you're done with it. and guess what you do. you flush it and it goes bye. it goes bye bye oh no. poopy go byebye oh god. poopy experience and go bang. bang this dude yeah i think that honestly. you think too much relax. breathe [ __ ] don't even have a watch that watch is one of the things i noticed take that watch throw it out the [ __ ] window put up your ass wow cut your hair do all sorts of stuff. that doesn't matter i'm gonna be in tucson. coming up chrisley dot com. wow oh you got it just literally you know. if you're in colorado you can come see me. krista dot com but dude. you just gotta go do. oh my god just relax dude. like easier said than done. you have some in my throat. yeah no you do yeah okay. uh i think that you know. i just what i think is that. whatever man life's just happening [ __ ] chill out no man i mean it like the guy needs to. chill out dude yeah. like you're clearly a good dude. and you mean well but like you might have gotten somebody fired. you're a good dude if you got someone fired. that sucks dude and you're a snitch. but you didn't mean to. you're right but like that that's something. to be careful. of but if you don't let your mind. set a little bit you're gonna. get somebody you don't want to. be an accidental snitch. yeah dude that's oh whoops. oh he got fired oh no. yeah i hate this. term from when to. when i hate this. term but you accidentally were a karen. that's what that is yeah. you know yeah it's an accidental. nobody wants to be a karen. so that should be enough. reason to tone it. down but it's okay though. ain't a mistake you're still young. yeah yeah you're gonna be a [ __ ] accidental snitch. again i like accidental snitch. over or karen because he didn't mean. to yeah he didn't mean. to uh well karen knows what. she's doing kind of you know. accidental karen all right that's why i said accidental karen. man i didn't say he was a karen. okay i also don't use that. term i take all of that. back i don't say karen. okay well you say it's an accidental. snitch then i don't a sit i don't say ass. uh all right cool tour. tickets
