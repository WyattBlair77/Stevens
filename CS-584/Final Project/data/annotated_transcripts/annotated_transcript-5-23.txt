[ __ ] [ __ ] that we have in this there's no furniture in my house except for this studio and one fire we don't have the internet and when i said to. one fire hey i don't have internet. he said okay and got here and then when we got here. he did the quintessential hey guess what i thought. you meant when you didn't have internet. you didn't have internet in your new place. now why the [ __ ] would i tell him that i didn't have internet. in my new place when we were going. to be recording him. our place now that's very interesting. to me however we're gonna let it slide. and so right now we don't have internet. and we don't even have a chair. for him so he went outside. and brought in a [ __ ] rocking chair so he's sitting there like a goddamn grandma. and i'm doing my podcast. in episode 19 my babies. and he's sitting there like a goddamn grandma. and it's all good my babies it's free. can't you can sit in whatever. the [ __ ] you want to. but he's rocking could. you sit in a rocking chair. and not rock i don't think i don't think that not not. really everyone feels them. fills themselves enough to. sit when they sit in a rocking. chair to rock it. back and forth that's how you do. it yeah so anyway big. changes coming to the log cabin. big changes coming. to the [ __ ] actual life of me. and you know it's whatever we dohe. not only do we have not an internet. internet we have we don't have a cell. service so this is like a real log cabin. in the [ __ ] this is the real log cabin that we're in not having [ __ ] cell service not having what do you call it internet. so that's what's up anyway. i'm feeling okay today dude. i went to. [ __ ] therapy talked about a little bit about my anger. issues sometimes i don't really didn't really think i had anger. issues until recently when in the past. two three years started blaming everybody. else for everything that is my fault. so it's all good let's skip. over that and not get to. series too quickly but yeah i [ __ ] didn't even really write [ __ ] down for this episode i'm like this is gonna be the let's just talk about one thing do it i forget. what i was talking about. this with but i was talking about it. with somebody was talking about instagram. and this was it one. of my buddies somewhere was talking about how he's done. with instagram meeting girls off. instagram because they just don't look like they do. in person and it's like all and it's a lie. we were talking about how it's a lie. it's a straightup lie if you're a girl. and you look one. way on instagram i guess. guys do it too but like but probably not. because it's not makeup. there's not that guys don't really give a [ __ ] that much. about the angles. unless that's their thing they're models which every girl. thinks they're a model. though on instagram so it doesn't really matter. but like these girls will post. a picture that is just not them. straight up it's like they might as well. be in a [ __ ] kabuki. mask and then they and then they and then they and then you i guess you meet them and they look like somebody else and that's crazy. how that's like a straight up. [ __ ] liz i you know it's a straight up [ __ ] lie they're saying i'm like oh there was a whole thing what was it called black fishing or whatever the the the model that was like a white girl but she used bronze makeup and she like tried to. get the full lips. and a big booty that's the you. know the quoteunquote you know. i guess ethnic look. or whatever and then people who were like you. know women who were like black or you know. latina were like hey this. is our look you're trying. to [ __ ] you know up you're appropriating our look and [ __ ] like that and and then the girl is like this is just i got a tan what do you want me to. [ __ ] do and i got blood implants i can't take them out. you know anyway my point is is if you're a girl. and you are posting pictures where you don't. look like you and you know what those. goddamn pictures are then that's like saying that's like meeting. a guy and saying i own. a casino and you don't own. a casino and when you're found out. and when someone says you're dating a guy. and you're like yeah what do. you do oh you know i [ __ ] own. a casino it's all good. i got a lot of money. cuz this casinos community i make a lot of money. off the casino and then and then you find out. the the ladies like oh you don't but you don't own. a casino and why do you work. at a [ __ ] bank of america. as a teller instead. of going to the casino everyday. and then as a guy you say well. i don't know what you're talking. about i own a goddamn casino and sticking with that. that's your online presence. as a man telling someone you own. a goddamn casino and sticking with it even though. you know and they know you don't own. a goddamn casino that's what it. is that's what it's like ladies. when you post a picture where you look. like a [ __ ] mannequin and then you show up and you look like a troglodyte chu doin dude. you're lying so i own a casino and i make millions and millions. and millions and millions and billions. of dollars off of the casino and morongo dude. my opener has a miami dolphins hat. that he wears and it has an m and it looks like it's a [ __ ] morongo hat. and every time he sees. it i say all cool.

italian it's like yeah okay you're american. you [ __ ] piece of [ __ ] um but what also what was the [ __ ] i was i was listening to. this thing on what the [ __ ] was it some podcast some [ __ ] ass podcast listen is actually good oh the ted radio hour dude. the guy who does the [ __ ] ted radio hour. this is another thing i would play. if i had it but i don't have it. but the but the guy they were talking about fortune. cookies this guy's voice is the guy. they always bring it to. the most dramatic [ __ ] [ __ ] like this lady was talking about how chinese food american chinese. food is way different than chinese. chinese food like there's no fortune. cookies if you give a fortune. cookie to somebody in. beijing they're like why the [ __ ] is there paper in this fortune cookie that's an american thing at general tso's chicken is an american thing because if you bring up general chow his name in china they're like oh yeah the [ __ ] famous general that killed 20 million people but here we know him is chicken so they are talking about that and then they always bring this [ __ ] [ __ ] sometimes they really try to. fit it in they're like like what. does he say at the end. of this it's really funny. actually here in the united states. if you're chinese too often to. be fruit wait so when you go. to a chinese restaurant. there's kind of a wink and somebody will give you fruit. if i go it's like we cannot it's just understood it's like a like a whole. different parallel we don't know. so they'll do this [ __ ] and then at the end they'll say the guy will say so they're gonna always try to. bring around to. something grand or point. and it often isn't a grand point. they're just like trying he'll be like so maybe it's not. important that chinese food is different. whatever continent you're on maybe it's the fact. that life hands like what. but you can get hypnotized and be like oh oh yeah no you can get hypnotized into. the guys the guy's voice is so like so let me get this. straight if you're in baking and you give chinese. you give a fortune cookie to. somebody in beijing they'll look you weird. and she'll be like yeah i've done. it i did it for 20. years there's always somebody who's like did. some study for way. too long that's the most boring. a study so we're talking to. a woman that went to. beijing and and handed out fortune cookies for 25. years all in the name of science. and now let me ask you. linda how how many how many times did a chinese person. from china actually eat the fortune. cookie and understand that it. was what americans thought. or chinese did um none so let me. ask you a question. then do we all die. i guess yeah and then you're you're supposed. to be like this when you listen. to it oh somebody's got us. that's changing it's the weather. they sound so smug. it's not bad it's it's good. a lot of it is really good. but we're gonna take you back. to a time where the dinosaurs. were on the earth. nope with a dinosaurs. or were they just versions of us. i don't want to. be on that and i want to. just be like they were [ __ ] dinosaurs are you angry. or is it simply us. that are angry what i'm you. you're me wrong sort of connected. he and he ends their everything. with a [ __ ] question even if it's not maybe it's the fact that we're all connected see this way if he's wrong he could be like being wrong it's about being right. the wrong way yeah okay. man [ __ ] off welcome to. ted radio hour where it's not ted talk. but it's another thing it's called ted radio hour. this way we can have two. different podcasts

cuz i'm disrespectful yeah man i watched this [ __ ] thing last night and i don't know i was told to. watch the [ __ ] darren brown by the way you know this guy's like the mentalist. or whatever darren is the most british. [ __ ] [ __ ] name it name it and his name is darren but darren you know and every time you google darren brown it. says did you mean. darren brown and i want to. be like no google i meant. darren brown and he should change his name. but i watched the [ __ ] thing now he's like this mentalist that'll be like it's so i don't he did. i talked about it a long. time ago it was the push it was called. push on netflix and he gets a guy to. [ __ ] kill somebody which is like ridiculous. but he like basically just plays on. there he selects the right. people first of all he weeds. out the non bitchmade betas and then he picks up. the bitchmade betas and then he's like i'm going. to merely suggest a bunch of little things. to this man and eventually. he's going to end. up you know impairing himself. on a sword just to. find out if it's even possible. like so fought you know. so this one is called. the ss and i was told to. watch it and because it was amazing. and i watched it and it's basically about a guy. who's you know it's darren brown. here he comes and he's like the guy who killed robert. kennedy was it was said. he said sirhan sirhan was does his name. and he was said he said that. he was hypnotized to. kill somebody now the whole thing. about him does a hypnotized asian is. that you can't you supposedly not be able. to hypnotize somebody into. doing something that they wouldn't. normally do right so you can hypnotize. someone and be like hey go [ __ ] take a [ __ ] in the bathroom. right now and you be like okay. gotta go take a [ __ ] and you go take a [ __ ] in the bathroom. but maybe you wouldn't believe minute. eyes and be like hey go take a [ __ ] in the middle. of starbucks because you wouldn't necessarily normally. do that now if your [ __ ] made beta which a lot of the guys that darren brown. weeds out these guys apparently darren brown. is saying you could make somebody possibly. go take a [ __ ] in the middle of starbucks. but also more importantly you can make hypnotize. somebody to go kill. somebody because that's what sirhan sirhan. says has no memory of it. and he still to. this day says he was hypnotized or whatever. the [ __ ] right so he made this thing to. see if it would he if it was even possible. and so he goes to. he gets this guy and he gets this. guy to do a bunch of [ __ ] that he wouldn't normally. do like not feel cold if he's in a ice. and ice bucket and then he snaps. his fingers and the guy's like huh. it's freezing and he's like and i made you feel. like it's not cold and he's like well how'd you do. that oh my god and he's just [ __ ] this empty [ __ ] ass that will do anything anyone else says right cuz there's levels of people like imagine imagine here's the thing imagine me being hypnotized that's not gonna work cuz you know i'm gonna be like the [ __ ] he talkin about imagine joe rogan being hypnotized it's not gonna work right but if you imagine a bitchass [ __ ] that's like wait where do i go like that kind of guy he gets [ __ ] for sure hypnotized but darren brown does [ __ ] like hey let me let me see your hand let me shake your hand and then he'll touch his for it'll be like no sleep now what he did was and the guy will just [ __ ] fall down and fall asleep and i'm like that's [ __ ] horseshit right i'll look at my girl i'll be like that's horseshit right and she's like yeah that's horseshit. but then i'm like watching the [ __ ] thing and it seems real like these people don't seem like actors so he falls and falls asleep. and the guys out cold. and just sleeping cuz he touched. his head and darren brown's. like so what i did. was we took a normal activity. where he shook my hand. and then i interrupted that and when you interrupt something. in a normal activity it. checks the body up and then when i touch the their head. it interrupts it even more and then what happens. is i'm so confident that they fall. asleep and which is like okay. okay so okay so uh i don't know anybody in my life. that that would happen to. but okay alright so now he spends the whole show. trying to hypnotize this. guy uh to. kill somebody so he shows. him the polka dot these polka. dot wallpaper shits and he's like. yeah if you ever see this. you're gonna [ __ ] go into. a trance and then kill someone so he has a go to. a [ __ ] auditorium where a guy speaking stephen fry by the way who i've worked with it's just a funny [ __ ] comedian from britain and he's talking and this lady in the polkadot dress comes and sits in front of the [ __ ] [ __ ] as beta. and the guy goes like must kill. you know and then just [ __ ] pulls a gun out and that that he was given to. by darren brown and for some reason. this guy was like hey i'll hold the gun. for you and just didn't understand. what's going on and then literally lapsed in memory and just shot stephen. fry with blanks obviously and then stephen friend stephen fry. fell on the ground and then later. on when the kid when the [ __ ] has beta snaps out of it. darren brown's like so what happened he's like i just watched stephen fry do a lecture he's like okay anything else happened and he was like no now and darren brown i was like what if i told you that you can't you shot stir fry and the guy's like oh what what and he's like you shot him stephen fry was like you shot me and he's like well and they show him video of it and he's like that's not me i did that i it's just so like hey man who are you man he no memory of it so i guess my question for the babies is do you believe in that or not have you ever been hypnotized cuz i wouldn't even [ __ ] say okay hypnotize me cuz i'd be like yo no cuz it's not gonna work so you have to. be suggestible is that the word. i don't know but like i wanted him. to be like hey here's the thing. that would i would here's the thing. that would sell me on hypnotize. him franchising someone will be worth it. would be would be true. like i even killing someone. i don't believe that i believe okay. maybe secretly he wanted to. do it to. get away with it and then blame it. on hypnotizing i believe you hypnotizing. works if you hypnotize someone. to suck a guy's dick. and they're not gay that's i believe then then i'll believe it. works so darren brown. your next special i want you. to be like i am getting. a roomful of hardcore straight. homophobic men and what we're doing is. we are going to. try and get them to. suck each other off and then they're like now. when you see polka dots. remember i want you to. get horny for another. man and i want you to. i want you to. become gay and i want you to. suck that guy's dick. and then when they see the polka dot thing. they're gonna the guy oh go. like must suck and then gets on his [ __ ] knees. and then just start but they have to. make sure the other guy. also or no you know. what it should be a gay. guy it should be a gay. guy that's like yeah that's right. yeah do it then i would believe it. suck him off to. completion when you see polka dots. you're going to want. to suck a guy off. to complete here you go. and then a guy walks in with a polka dot dress. and he's just like must sock. off gets on his knees. and then afterwards are like so just come all. over his face what happened. and he's like i don't know what happened. did i eat a glazed. doughnut no and other guys. there with just no pants. on and he's just all spent and he's just like what did. what just what does happen. he's like i don't know i was just in a room. full of guys who were just chilling. no what if i told you you sucked. a guy off well i had no. way i'm not gay [ __ ] that well here's video and it's just a [ __ ] [ __ ] video just gotta floss oh and everybody's like now and for the face and you hear his voice all right so it's off volf in just some [ __ ] fat guy in a polkadot dress just fall off and the guys like yeah okay cool yeah yeah kind of in my mouth and he's like well i didn't do that congratulations you're gay no no yeah i've watched gay with turned round and on that nothing on it don't there here's a tower man on it here's this for him to. eat the rest then on it. no man on there. how about the porns where they do. that do it it's like you know. what sex is degrading enough. if you're a guy who gets off on. being degrading you know during sex. it's degrading enough do you know. why you're mounting someone so you don't need to. go the whole nine and come on someone's face and then give them a spoon. for the rest of it you ever. see that porn i guess i have because i'm a sexual. deviant but i'm not but they'll. be like here i saw one. where a guy [ __ ] spurred it into. a [ __ ] glass and it was like drink it like what hey he got probs what if i told you you had a guy come into. a gus and then you drank it well i didn't do it. oh no his video of it. oh floss floss nope nope. brown maybe it's not. about being gay maybe it's about being hypnotized [ __ ] idiot maybe we're all gay maybe it's a sliding. scale maybe it's like what. kinsey said it's on a scale from one to. six maybe most of us fall somewhere between. and it's very rare that we're a six heterosexual or a one. homosexual maybe

later this [ __ ] guy dude one fire man we don't have the internet so it's hard for us to. [ __ ] do this [ __ ] i'm doing the ads all in the get in the wrong place but it is what it is hey what you want to. know something that's so annoying. when your straw breaks and you got to. suck it up like all. right it's like and it's [ __ ] shooting on your shirt and all that [ __ ] it's annoying i have a hard life uh i'm a double keep doubling it to. a kill me uh what else. happened this week though. yeah you do even know. guys i like how ump slyke what. about this individual one. thing i love how it trump's. like totally cleared. wasn't me and then they're like you're individual. one and he's like nah. someone else how does he even get away. with that actually dude he's got his thirty. percent that just will believe him. trump could come out and be like hey i'm a frog. i know people will be like yeah he probably is actually. if you think about it this. way he's always hopping around. different areas one days talking. in phoenix and another days in washington it's big leap. but if you use any animal would be a frog. yeah i don't know i'm not. very political i don't know. much about it what i do. know is nothing that's what i do. i don't know what's that. [ __ ] mark twain quote where he's like i was so smart when i was 16 but i [ __ ] don't know dude i you know i don't give a [ __ ] this whole. thing's burning down. and you're with me oh. that's what i should talk about the knavish patel. is that his name the guy. who are certain island life. is him his nami tell who is who told a joke. on stage about how at a college. and they unplugged his microphone. and how they were like he was like doing a joke. standup that was like he said something. about being gay is obviously a choice. because there are black gay. guys i'm paraphrasing but he said why. would you choose to. have two things that people could you know. be hateful against you about right. the crowd didn't respond i. didn't like it and then i guess. a few minutes later. they came up on stage. and pulled his microphone. and we're like hey we're deciding to. go a different way with the rest of the show. you've been relieved and so you know. it's it's obviously that the the colleges. choice to do that and i get it. and free speech doesn't mean. that they can't [ __ ] take unplug his microphone. because it's a college and they can do. it if the [ __ ] they want and if they don't want to. hire somebody that does that then they can. fire them on the spot. i get it i'm not like they [ __ ] solid to. them or whatever that's what. american no it's very american to. do that if you want to. however it is not it. does not benefit you to. not hear what people have. to say for instance one. time i told a joke. on stage where i said. something about how i'm i just gonna sound [ __ ] but i said something about how i'm gross. or something i'm not a i'm not if something like i'm unattractive. or something like that and a a girl in the audience. goes oh shut up stop no you're not or something. and i couldn't tell the rest of the joke. which was a joke. on the joke where i was going. to explain why i wasn't gross. or why i was more attractive. or some [ __ ] stupid joke. i was doing i can't remember but because she did. that she didn't listen to. the rest of the jokes. is you didn't understand what i was trying. to [ __ ] say she just heard the first part. of it that's obviously not a problem. because who cares it's about nothing. but this guy possibly. the rest of the joke. could have been something else that would have been illuminating for this. college or you just my point. is listen to. the whole thing and then decide you silencing. somebody or deciding somebody can't. speak is only hurting you because then you don't you. don't get to. hear the whole thing and then make a decision. i mean it's not [ __ ] easy it's that basic. if you don't get to. hear the whole thing you have. to let people you hate talk. because if you don't do that. then you won't know what the [ __ ] they think you won't know how to. argue against it i mean there's so much wrong with it. if we say hey white supremacists no. don't say this don't say that. you can't do this you can't. do that then they're going. to get more mad and mobilize. even more by the way. oh they're out to. silence us let them [ __ ] exhaust themselves we'll learn more about it and decide maybe how the [ __ ] do these guys get this way and then maybe we'll be able to. [ __ ] you know diminish it as much as we can because that's what you know should be done. i'm doing a very bad. job of explaining this but my point. is you have to. let everybody talk free speech is free. speech because i think that maybe the young. generation doesn't believe in free. speech and even though that's what america. we fought so hard. to get free speech. i mean it's been so many so many so many so many so many so many years. to get to this point. i mean now we're here we're gonna [ __ ] it up a big time we haven't even had it for that. long you know you got to. be able to. say what you want you. got to be able. to joke how you want you. got to be able. to say what you want. i mean for it. to be a crime to. say something that's where we're headed. you know i don't know if we will get there. but if the youth is that way. then next thing you know. the adults will be that way. because they grow mmm i know. it's all cyclical i guess but it's just a weird. thing to think about i. don't know when i go and i play these colleges. i get [ __ ] sometimes when if they groan which is you know if you go in with a different attitude. i don't know i'm like a little bit of a more aggressive. louder comic i feel like that happens. less to people like that because you know we seem confident. you know i don't know anything. about i don't know anything. about animation beetles act i mean. i'm sure he's hilarious. the joke seemed funny to. me but i just feel like they don't i'm waiting. for the college's to do that. [ __ ] i'm waiting for them. to do that i'm waiting for them. to be offended. can't wait because also it's not all. of them that think that like there. are definitely our people in the colleges. that are like oh no he should be able. to say what he wanted. [ __ ] that why did you end the show but the problem is a shame because then those people can be shamed would be like oh yeah but that's the wrong. way to think and like yeah. and then you ruin the [ __ ] guy's career. you're on the guy's [ __ ] social life. because they think a certain way. it's just man i don't know. this isn't very funny but this is how it is i guess. because what was that thing in like spain. where a comedian said something. political and then wound up. in prison wasn't in spain. camera can look it up. he's one of the internet. but uh yeah it was like jailed or something. because of what he said politically. and that's the next few steps if we don't [ __ ] stop bitching and moaning about what people are saying. whatever do it i'm able. to have this podcast. i could say whatever. i want right now so i guess. i'm happy and i'm maria. i'm already 38 so. you know my life is in full. swing but dude if i have a kid and he's gonna be like we can't draw pictures of jesus or whatever the [ __ ] you know it's against the law imagine hey what are you here for oh i [ __ ] i raped and killed people what are you in here for well i drew a picture of jesus holding a penis whatever you know i don't [ __ ] know anymore. i'm just excited to. get the [ __ ] new studio going dude. did you get your wouldn't. make wouldn't make a dent shirts. they shift them out finally. so if you didn't get them now you'll get them soon. i don't have mine of course. but brendan schaub and my dad have theirs. so i don't know how the [ __ ] that happened. but i created the goddamn shirts. don't have them all. good one fire but cool um at least. i'm [ __ ] dripping with sauce in this. undefeated get right now [ __ ] bowl of pasta ask.
