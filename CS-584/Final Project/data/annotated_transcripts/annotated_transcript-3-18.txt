has i don't know it. feels more full it feel feels you know is it. my beard that makes it that acc accents. it no it's your hair. yeah but i i just your hair. that looks better so it's your hair. that's doing it no i know. but sometimes you add stuff. and it makes other stuff. look better like if you put on a watch you look. more complete disagree some people think that you put on a tie. it makes a suit look. better okay yeah okay okay okay so it's like maybe it's the beard. that i think the beard. in my hair the beard's. framing the hair frame it might be i don't know i i just my hair has been good but here's the deal. though then i'll like i'll wash it. and then like the next few. days it'll just look bad. or i'll uh or i'll see a picture i'll be. like i gotta get a cut yeah washing hair. is the end how often do i understand. end of it looking good. yeah uh i wash my hair. once every few weeks. oh really yeah oh wow. how come you're gonna watch it. more you hate doing it. i hate washing my hair. i hate the way. my hair feels after it's washed. uh now what's gonna happen. is people are gonna dm me. and say it's because you're doing it. like this and if you do it. like that it won't and i will tell you all. right now yes it will. even if i do it the way. you suggest so please don't. suggested thank you there. you go thank you and you should know. because you're you and you're 38. yeah me. i i i i've lived many. years as you know as only me and i know how the hairs on my head. works and hairs on my head. work and you know that's that and i'm just wondering about how like is my [ __ ] getting more full like i should be losing like i i feel like i love i i love i did lose. i lost some hair. i think in my or like when i was like 36. and then i kind of stopped losing some hair. sick and now i'm just kind of like is it. is it like am i regenerating i don't think you. were ever losing your hair. i think that was i think that was a myth. you made up i did make i do make up. some myths sometimes yeah um but yeah so anyway that looks good i'm happy. about that and it's getting. colder out right it is getting colder today was the first gray. day fully gray day. of the year and i was looking forward. to it all year. and it depressed. me so i'm looking forward. to it that's just how life's. like it was just so [ __ ] hot there was no in between room and we love it and i love that i want. it to be hot. only and i want it. to be hot all the time. yeah i i mean i like it. when it's warm i don't like it. when it's 100 degrees. though which it was like i want to. be 100 degrees why why. do you even live here. then move to. vegas i mean where it's [ __ ] terrible i don't want to. go to vegas because it's vegas. no i like 100 degrees. i wouldn't want every day. to be 100 degrees. obviously i want every day. to be like you know. 76 i would think that would be awesome. for me that isn't hot. though that's perfect i'll tell you what 76. outside is not hot 76. inside is hot people think. that yeah why is it. that's a conspiracy so. my my point is that's why. i have my air always at 76. inside because i know. secretly that's the right because if people say. oh if you say what is the best. temperature outside a lot of people will. be like well definitely not room. temperature probably more i know why why because they're outside there's breezes foreign playing a guitar. and like shade and like elements. you know so it's not just this. stagnant 76. indoors it's a stagnant. 76 and a stagnant 76. doesn't feel very good yeah. i don't know i think that it. should be 76. degrees always no matter what i'm holding your. doggy okay we're doing a show you. know adam sandler um you know. what i don't like how everyone always says adam. sandler he dresses so dope and that's the fit and he just wears basketball shorts. all the time who says that. it's on like people say adam's on. her dress as well yeah like like he's like yeah. this is the level i want to. be at and it's like no. i don't want to. be that lover i mean. i know he's so rich. and he's just wearing basketball shorts. because who gives a [ __ ] yeah but always i want. to be wearing pants. yeah i never want to. be wearing shorts wearing shorts. is my the very last straw. it's for me speaking of uh you know. outfits your outfit on halloween was really. great oh yeah yeah you were an american. cowboy i was american. i was the american cowboy. so i made up a character. uh we can get a pick. up there uh uh boat for. you guys but i was basically i had american. cowboy hat with red white. and blue and i had an american. jacket with red white and blue. stitched into it and i was wearing a sheriff's badge. so you know the priests. yeah so okay so you're the american. cowboy and also you you upheld the law. over yeah and you were trickortreating. and calvin i was basically the sheriff. and so therefore freeze basically um you were and uh also calvin. was a purple people eater. and you were there. and you were helping him. trickortreating it was really cute. oh dude he was so cute. huh yeah he's so focused. he did it like it's his job. yeah he was going. to trickortreat like it was his job. and then afterwards and he wasn't really saying. much and then afterwards. just talking so much it's because he had 7 000 grams. of sugar though yeah but he was saying. it before he even ate it. he was like i got so many candies. i got so many k. on the drive home i got so many. candies and we were like okay. okay i got so many candies. i mean it was unbelievable. and he got like 25. candies i mean i guess. that's a lot but to. him it's a lot. too i remember dude. i remember looking at his hall. the other day and i was like that. ain't [ __ ] yeah my haul's back in the day [ __ ] 70 pieces are bust 70 pieces or get out. of my [ __ ] way yeah i was coming up on 125 pieces just like pouring it out. [ __ ] mom and dad downstairs being like stop the other rocket because there was so much [ __ ] candy on the floor in their ceiling we're brothers i would have been there but um yeah speaking of outfits though i did not like we just were talking about this i don't like heidi klum's outfit as the worm and you liked it yes you said it was good and i want you to. expound on that what is good about it. what's good about it. is that it's cool to. look at it it's cool. to look at it. okay that's the reason i liked it. make a picture i'll look. at it but but i didn't see. her walk around and that seems like it. might tip this special the other way. like did she she should have just rolled around. wow so here's the thing i don't like about that. guy it's like she's outdone herself. she keeps out doing herself. she's gonna have to. what is she gonna be then you know. what i mean she next year. she's got it can't. be as good so i don't like it. because also it's it's so in the way. dude these costumes that are bigger. than you are make the costume. how big you are. right it's like you're going. to a party people are [ __ ] bumping into. her tripping and [ __ ] and like are you in line. like in the bathroom she can't get in because it's too. tall yeah and then what if she has to. go to the bathroom. i don't know she must have had. a bag on her yeah. maybe she put in a catheter. for the night yeah yeah colostomy bag disgusting. [ __ ] [ __ ] and pissing it oh my god yeah ew dude heidi klum you're gross. yeah you shouldn't pissed in your costume. so you were an american. cowboy she was a worm i was a dracula. and calvin was a purple. people eater and kristen was a witch. um and uh that's it we were that's what we had yeah. yeah apparently i was [ __ ] pissed though because last year. nobody came by my house so i didn't get candy. oh right and this year. people came by my house. really and the reason i didn't get candies. because they didn't come the year. before i was like i'm a way. up on a hill. they're not gonna combine yeah i got [ __ ] cold busted dude. twice but just turn all your lights. out i did i froze. no i mean but keep your so oh so they were were your lights. were out no the lights. are on oh yeah turn the lights. out i froze all right. you don't have to. actually freeze i don't want to. make my floorboards are creaky so i just went okay. but you can do basically just have your lights. out and then just but then i'm home. in the dark and it's [ __ ] sucks you know it's like hiding from two people in your american. cowboy outfit i will not be held. hostage by my fears okay. well this uh uh okay so i'm gonna be in boston coming. up in on a november. 12th the first show sold out. the second show where there are still. tickets left i got lakeland. florida and uh what another florida. uh lakeland another florida you know jacksonville. and then i've got uh san diego. and the new york new york. february 18th we added a show. at the beacon theater. uh the first one is almost sold out. and then i'll be at the chicago. theater so uh portland and seattle. seattle's almost done so go. to chrisley dot com. and get tickets and uh that's what's up. but what so did you want to. go in right into. it uh sure anything else about halloween. do you like halloween i don't uh i like how we know that. i'm a dad uh because this was the first. time that um calvin was uh uh aware. like a where aware. yeah right right yeah like he saw a big. skeleton he was just like a big. skeleton and then i was like you want to. go get more candy and he says yes and he runs. up there so he got a lot. of candies he was how did he know. he wanted to be a purple. people he said um he said that. he he likes the song. so our friend played this. song purple people eater i actually don't know no no no kristen played purple people eater okay that stupid song from the 1940s you know and uh he was playing it and then he liked it and then we said we wanted for halloween and he said people leader and we were like nobody has a purple people eater yeah how do you even know so she made it christian's crafty and she made it of course she did and she was and he was so basically we got the boo character. from monsters inc which is. purple it's the only purple. monster because i don't have a purple. people eater thing yeah you. know a costume and so she got the boo outfit and then she took one of the eyes. off because it's one eye. and then got a horn. put it on and then you know. change the costume a. little bit and people whenever someone was like hey it's boo i would get secretly pissed off. yeah you should get because it's good. people eater and if you knew booboo has two eyes. and no horns so you should ask. if you don't if you don't know what it. is you asked right. well they thought they knew but they were just dead. wronged yeah they were dead. wrong and they almost ruined. the entire uh night and i obviously. condone kyle's costume because it's all purple. and i'm all purple. all the time but oh hey june has. a [ __ ] purple color on baby. baby and booyah and so also uh calvin. was uh would they say oh boo. and then he thought people are saying boo. because of halloween and then he kept drawing. on the drive back he gave. she said boo she said. boo so it all kind of worked. out really right because it did work out. yeah um all right let's go. into lifeline in the news. here we go oh kanye. west continues to. selfimmolate by mentioning bad dealings with people he can't talk about and then mentions jewish. people which has led to. gap balenciaga and adidas to. cut ties with them. advice for kind of yeah. here's my advice for kanye shut. the [ __ ] up dude you can't open your mouth. without saying something super shitty. and [ __ ] offensive like shut the [ __ ] up dude right you can't dig yourself out you've said every possible [ __ ] shitty stereotype about jews. out loud in front of microphones. and in front of cameras shut the [ __ ] up. what i don't understand. is like is he does. he feel like he's on a crusade like why doesn't he just stop talking. i know like why do you have to. talk this is the thing about hate it's so weird. because you first of all i think he's he's mentally. not well but like why don't you just not. talk about that like you don't have. to talk about all the things. all the time pick other. things to talk about even if you do hate jews. or whatever the [ __ ] shut up don't talk. about it shut up. about it talk about other things. like your music or your [ __ ] fashion. they wanna you know. what i mean it's like that's the thing. i don't get so my advice. for kanye is spend time thinking about other. things besides jews yeah nip it in the butt. yeah boy he can't do that. now it's a fullbloom right. right right right right now and apparently he has apologized. and stuff and done stuff. like that but the media. is not covering it. which sucks he's [ __ ] the media. but [ __ ] but [ __ ] him but he'll apologize and be like but that's because like he's one of the 12. tribes of judah he says i'm not jewish. i'm jew uh and he's like trying. to circle encircle the whole thing. by saying how can i be antisemitic. when i'm black and that means i'm a jew. hey man that's not. what it means everything. you say is not true. also about that how about that everything. he says is not right. also if he's a jew then like he's talking about how he doesn't like jews. i know shut up yeah. you're then you're just you're contradicting yourself. because he's saying they've persecuted him. but he also he's part. of it say yeah. think about other things and i love how he says it. like it's some kind of [ __ ] new idea that nobody knows about hey man this is the same. [ __ ] dumbass conspiracy theory since 2000 years ago yeah yeah and we stopped and we try we should have stopped it basically a long time ago but also after the 40s definitely should have stopped because we saw what happened so yeah okay yeah seriously kanye next shut the [ __ ] up oh here we go another shot i don't know i pretty much know nothing about him except he's prolife so here's a big shut the [ __ ] up okay read. this and then okay so herschel walker. has an extremely prolife stance. on abortion despite having paid. for several of them in his past. relationships what's the advice for herschel. okay here's the advice rehearsal. be real yeah i know just be honest. man just say you can say. i you even if you want to. say i used to. be and i've been saved. since like just be [ __ ] real be honest. dude several women have come forth. and like they got receipts. receipts texts and literal receipts. in of payment for abortions. yes and he's saying i didn't do it. yes yeah and even his his other. children of which he's got like children. from like seven or eight. different women uh these children. that he acknowledges are his even those children. are like you're a [ __ ] [ __ ] like you've you've come i think he's accused of committing sexual assault as well like crazy [ __ ] he claims to. have been diagnosed with multiple personality. disorder and cured it himself. oh wow okay so don't vote. for him yeah but he's dude. he's running neck and neck. with [ __ ] raphael warnock and which is insane. it just goes to. show up entrench people off the candidate. doesn't matter the party matters. that's it right right right. which is so stupid wait. that's so [ __ ] crazy that uh also you know what i had a poster. of him when i was in my when i was a kid. dude he was the [ __ ] he was like the mo. it looks such an insane athlete. he was so good uh but you know. a lot of people just like [ __ ] actors just like politicians athletes they're [ __ ] they're heroes when you don't know anything about him. then they're [ __ ] absolutely idiot [ __ ] when you learn a few times he has concussions for sure so what what's the deal with does he say. that so he says i didn't that. didn't happen and people are just like okay. you think if he said it. did happen and i've changed and i think that the error. in my ways you think he would he'll probably [ __ ] take a dip no dude. that's the whole christian thing if he made it i mean he's an outwardly christian that's the whole. christian scene where born sinners we're born. [ __ ] terrible in the eyes. of god and all we can do. is ask for ask. for uh acceptance and then admit. that word [ __ ] just these pieces of [ __ ] you know uh john 6 14. we are all admit. that we are pieces. of [ __ ] yeah i mean basically that's the whole. bible admit you're a piece of [ __ ] admit. you're a piece of [ __ ] step your piece. of [ __ ] except one exodus step one meet your piece of [ __ ] yeah more or less and he won't admit. it the piece of [ __ ] adam met the piece of [ __ ] eaten i mean in the piece of [ __ ] garden and took a piece of [ __ ] bite out of an apple um snake came up said don't do it all right let's do it all right next well the advice for him is stop yeah be real stop poking be without a hat on but also beyond that be real be honest yeah it's a whole. christian way dude what the [ __ ] i want it well i mean look [ __ ] it it's no uh he was a football player in the 80s. he was definitely sporting with no. hat on i mean without so we know. even more than the receipts yeah. we know fact even football player. in the 80s support with no hat. on so absolutely you should. have more kids also he he also [ __ ] is like has like impersonated cops. he's done like a ton of illegal. [ __ ] what he's he's he's of course he has football player. domestic abuse like everything. football player in the 80s. there you go yeah that's the way. the department no hat on. and pretending you're a cop. there was like a checklist for football. players in the 80s yeah. put on this badge okay. and go around and try to. rescue all right great. thanks joe montana hit her. and then supporting her with no. hat on okay great. okay jerry rice your next. okay here we go. hey chris hey matt it's trista. from calgary alberta just wanted. to ask how would you react. when a girl makes the first move. i'm sure both of you. have had experience in that. oh he's three years old. so i'm pretty young and actually this. is kind of the first year. that of my life that i've felt it. happening and noticed it. um because you're so sexy. and every time i do notice. it i get flattered. and all but i freeze up. i feel like maybe i'm still supposed. to put in a bunch of effort. or i don't know this. girl so i have to. really try but uh i don't really know. what to do i get stunned. practically because it just seems awkward. it seems different and i know. it shouldn't be and i really wish that i had a little bit. of a voice in my head. telling me just to. go for it stick with what's going. on and stick with the situation. but i always kind of mess. it up and run. away or or push them away. so if you guys have any advice about that that'd be. awesome to hear thanks. i got some great. advice for that what stop running. away when a girl tries. to kiss you hey what's your name nobody gonna try. to kiss him he said first move. we don't know if that. means to kiss or if it's flirting. okay just like first step. one just [ __ ] relax like he sounds like such a spaz i always run away. or pushing her away like relax. dude yeah like the most relaxed possible. the girl likes you you like the girl. all she's doing is showing you. signs that she likes you this. is a good thing this. is a good thing take a deep. breath of this to happen. although i will say it does kind of throw me. off like if you know i don't know it's different. uh it's different honestly. being uh well okay look i don't like being famous. is different because obviously it. happens all the time but like but like to. be somebody that's just at a power. party and a girl starts. hitting on you like that. to me that's like uh is she just am i gonna wind up. dead is this a spy. this is so weird. yeah it's so weird. not to me probably because it's happened. to me so many times okay. if you're at a party and you're not on you know. people know who you are if you're at a party. and this isn't what you do. you're just some guy at a party. and some girl comes up. to you and says hey what's up. wow nice sweater. you look great what's your thing. we should get you i should get your number. all the middays work. for you yeah you don't think huh. i don't know i don't think anything bad. i think oh that was great. this saved me so much. work right but it's definitely odd but it stands. out to me in a good way. just turn it turn your perspective. dude yeah it's like eliminating so much so many like things. hoops you might have to. jump through she's being clear. she's being forward this is what we want. people to be yeah i think but yeah i guess. so i've heard people talk about how like they as the men. like to be the one. leading you away but like [ __ ] give that up and if that is the thing that you feel then just when when a girl says hi how you doing what are you doing here and then once you ask for your number and then she's like we should go out sometime you just go like this no no no no no no sweetheart. that's not how this works. right [laughter] i'll take it. from here i'll take it. from here dame nice. scams and walk away yeah. uh i just think you need to. take a deep breath man. it sounds like you panic. when a girl shows interest in you uh but speaking from vast. experience yeah you know let it happen. how many times have you been hit on. i can't count yeah many. many times period though that's what. he means um yeah so happens. to be all the time. too so it's fine. not happy to be more. okay well so that's all good. i don't know yeah next that's it. for this guys this one happens. to me all good hey man. chris matt you're hot hit me. up what did i tell. you right on cue um i need some advice. i've been dating this guy. for about six months he's a private. pilot which is cool. i guess but it's not what i like about. him um it's now six months. in and it's still the only thing. he talks about uh it's always like a blue jeff. foxworthy i flew um rod stewart. this is how propellers work. engines whatever i don't care. that's washington i try to. change the subjects and he has this incredible. ability to just turn it. right back into easy. piloting flying [ __ ] um i've made it really obvious that it's annoying to. me he's not getting the hints at this. point do i just tell him to. shut the [ __ ] up i don't want to. be an [ __ ] like do i do the spin move out. of there like it's really. really annoying and i don't know. what to do so help. that sounds bad yeah it is a good. one what do you what do. you uh have to. say here's the thing people don't this. guy's got a problem i used to. think people like me because i'm a comedian. but like that's not why. people like me people like you because you're you you. know and they don't like you because you're you and if she likes you it's because you're you this. is the thing i wish we had him. on for the advice right. yeah but like what she's got to. do is just be like yo i don't give a f. i like you because you're you i don't care. how high up you are. i don't give a [ __ ] how close to. the cloud you are i don't care. that you're in a metal tube. 30 000 feet in the sky. i only care you're you and right. now the you you're being is. braggadocious about something that i don't. even like you because of yeah. right now yes i got that. one i nailed it right. now you are being hella [ __ ] annoying yeah hella hella [ __ ] annoying dude she looks like she was from north north they're in california no she's definitely not she's from chicago. or philadelphia oh okay well so sorry. look sorry sorry i ever said something. yeah uh but um yeah i don't uh yeah. it's i don't i don't know. i i think it's so annoying. when people talk about what they do. all the time i mean. you see you see it happen. with with dad because he's like a producer. and a director right and then people will who are actors they just want to. talk business with them and you know dad's like i would just rather. talk about the dodgers. he doesn't want to. talk about work ever and that's how i feel too. yeah i mean i kind of like talking. about comedy sometimes but i i just mostly like joking. around the thing for me. is that i think and talk enough. about movies about what i do. enough if if i have the option to. talk to somebody about movies. or something else almost always i'll choose. something else so i'm the exact opposite. of this guy why does he want. to talk about all the people he's how many times can he bring up. that he flew rod. stewart around right well he's probably insecure. about how he he wants. her to like him. because of the [ __ ] famous people that he cards around. but also that's like bragging about being online. next to [ __ ] paul giamatti which i was for tacos. in santa barbara thank you. oh really i do like that about you. i think that what uh yeah. basically all you do is [ __ ] you're a chauffeur in the sky yeah dude. exactly yeah it's not good. yeah oh it's like you're an uber driver. uber driver that happened. to pick up rod stewart. yeah he cares born who cares. okay so i better have better. [ __ ] going on about you but we're again we're veering into. giving advice to the guy. for you i think i mean. maybe bring it up what's the best. way to bring that up. be like hey man like you talk about flying. a lot uh that's cool. i think it's awesome. you're a pilot but i also don't that's not what i like about. you yeah you talk about it. a lot and i wonder why if you're trying. to impress me but what's the tone. to take with that because you don't want. to get him like just say how i said it. that's so like that's that's i don't know. that's too i'm aggressive yeah accusatory or something. yeah christian says i have a tone okay. well i don't okay okay well you do but i think if you come. at it yeah i guess. if you come at it like from a question. perspective like why do you do do. you think i like don't like you already. i do like you don't have. to constantly tell me. about this stuff try. to impress me i'm already. impressed by who you are. yeah you could also say whenever he starts. bringing up somebody like i i flew around. jeff foxworld to be like oh [ __ ] and then get your pad out and then write down and he says what you're doing well. i keep track on uh who you uh fly. around because i think it's so [ __ ] awesome right. right i think he'll get to. him right or you could do. the same thing yeah take a pad out. write something down and he says what are you. running and she can say i just like to. make lists of the most [ __ ] boring dumb. things i've ever been told yeah. and that is absolutely near. the top yeah you say that. too yeah yeah which would which would definitely get him. that's good that's good that's good. both of those are good that. might even be better that would. definitely get a stop sooner. yeah you wouldn't have thought about it. if i did what i did. but it's fine all right. so let's go to. the next one but uh yeah. that's a tough that's tough but it. maybe i don't know but maybe maybe the sex. is good i have a dog. on my lap madison matt. big fan of the pod. my question for y'all today is. um i love going to. the gym it's my thing. i've been going for years now. and i lately can't seem to. get through a workout without somebody trying. to talk to. me she's bad or asking me. out what are we going to. do i feel like i have bother. me written on my forehead and i just don't understand. what's happening lately. it makes me really uncomfortable. because i'm generally a really shy. person and i don't like um so much attention. and i also feel really bad rejecting. people because i know it. takes a lot of courage. to ask somebody out. so i guess my question is how do i reject someone. nicely and also maybe how do i make myself. less approachable is that weird i don't. yeah no no it's not weird. yeah but you know. what my advice says don't be. so bad okay how did she do how does she like lower her. badness well first of all i mean i hate you know people are always like well you should wear whatever you want [ __ ] these dudes but like if you're working out some of these outfits that these these women who wear at the gym yeah they accentuate the badness. right but i mean they have they have [ __ ] like uh uh like lululemon shits. that like curve under the under the butt. right and like it makes it look like it's like and that's like okay. if you're trying to. [ __ ] make people not talk to. you don't accentuate them well. let's assume she's not doing. that because i'm just saying so let's let's start with that if you are doing that. don't accentuate the badness. wear a [ __ ] you know it's really annoying here's what i think you could wear different [ __ ] but if you want it okay go go ahead but you're at the gym how come most guys i know are like oh my god i when i say something like the worst place to. hit on a woman is at the gym. that is very true. so why does every guy. agree with me and yet. every woman has this can play who the [ __ ] are these guys that don't know. this i'll tell you why. because i do know this. but they also are at the gym. and the girls go to. the gym and they're there. all the time and they see them. all the time so in a guy's head. they're like oh i've seen. her a bunch are you using that. oh cool oh my by the way this and that you're gonna [ __ ] end up talking and flirting just because you're looking bad. you feel bad you're a dude. and you feel bad because you're putting up. two plates right so you feel bad and you think well this is the baddest i've been i'm the baddest i am at the gym. and this chick's got the [ __ ] that scoops her under right. and it the lululemon shits. that keep her the the [ __ ] apple up. and nice and so he's like she's bad. i'm bad i'm being bad we're both. bad michael jordan michael jackson michael jackson hey we see. the i'm bad you ain't. nothing and we see each other. all the time and so it's like let's just [ __ ] see what's up. dude are you using that. nice bam oh you come. here a lot oh bam. if you're there at the gym. if you're there at the gym. and i'm there at the gym. i don't give a [ __ ] because i'm not attracted to. you but if you're attracted to. badness like a lot of these dudes and a lot of the dudes that work out i hate to. say it and this is going. to come across a prejudice but they're persian. and you know persians when they see chicks. i have to say. something though so the the guys. that are doing it are persian. and the guy i'm not i don't talk. to many persian guys but you're saying they're my favorite. people are persians so i guess sam a good friend. of ours is persian. but that might be the only one. that i speak to. sam at the gym sim. doesn't go to the gym. but if he went to. the gym he couldn't help. himself he's like hey hey what's up. you're going to be using that. oh see this is a thing. i don't know yeah uh because i don't know. many person man that must be why all the men. who agree with me. yeah i think that uh you know. what you can do is first. of all what's this. earphone airpods okay you're fine. they might not come up. so don't accentuate the battle. oh you're saying she should wear them. and then you can pretend you don't. hear anything yeah here's what will be great. here's what would be great. you don't have to. come across as being a dick. a dick but you guys. go hey what's up yeah and you let him. do the whole thing and go like this. what yeah the state of what rude. like implying that you definitely don't want. even to take them. out and be out of breath right. what right yeah oh never mind. right you're still being a person. even though i said that. i mean persian they hit on. a lot first of all i think even if you're wearing lululelemons that. is my brother would say. shape your apple in the right make the apple right. make it look like it's in the back. of your back uh you could wear whatever. you want but just do the headphones. thing yeah and then it'll it'll it'll be like she you know. just how she wipes her. ass with the little image what's that. because the ass is so high up. oh oh oh oh god that's disgusting. okay something about people wiping their ass. in general you know what i mean. there's nothing more disgusting. than wiping an ass you're like oh. oh you have bad breath. but like no i farted. because it came out here all right. okay okay why is it. up here i farted. i'm wearing a little lemon. why is it up here. yeah yeah like like farts only smell. down by that um yeah so don't be so bad number one. that's your own problem go go. to your mom and be like mom what the [ __ ] yeah you made me so bad yeah i'm at the gym. i can't get these persians. away right right right god damn it. i'm going to the bathroom. yeah you know mom why'd you have. to make me so bad. i put on lululemon's and it's crazy. dude it's dude it's a [ __ ] la fitness right. i mean i guess yeah yeah just do the headphones. thing you're all good hey guys. i want to. take a break and talk to. you about surf shark. look sure surf shark. is a vpn which keeps your online. activity private but there are a bunch of reasons to. have a vpn and it's honestly. one of those things that's just growing. and growing it's better. it's it's cooler and cooler. to have it and it's uh more and more necessary. uh you can access your bank. safely even on public. wifi stuff like this. get the best deals. with online shopping it uh they don't let websites show. you prices based on your location. or device turn on your surf shark. vpn and get the best deals. when shopping online or buying. your next flight ticket. uh i actually was in london. um and couldn't sign into. my hbo account went. and i used surf shark. because you know they don't let you do. it through the um different countries. went through my surf shark. and guess what i'm watching. house of dragons right. that's what happens so i uh i use surf shark. myself to watch blacked. out baseball games that i want to. see oh it's great for sports. yes exactly that they don't show. necessarily uh where you are staying yes. exactly uh in your life. in your state uh one subscription. unlimited devices yes you could even. share one account with all your friends. and pay less than a piece. of gum for a more secure. and private online life it's just worth it. man it's one of those things. everybody's gonna have soon you should you have to. have this you should have this. the link is in the description below. to get 83 off. and three extra months. for free that's surf shark. so go in the description below. and get the link and i've got a question. about career mentality so. i work for a fortune 500. company and dragon we are known. to not necessarily pay as well. as some of the other companies in our industry right. and don't get me wrong. i am a 26. year old homeowner and i do very well for myself. i don't necessarily feel like i'm getting compensated for the value. that they say i am putting forward yeah. okay um you know they've given me. an exceptional performance rating over. the past two years and i have gotten pay. bumps but i could be making more at another company so how do i navigate that kind of conversation with my manager or continue to. put forth that 110 effort if i don't feel like i'm being compensated for the the value. that they say i'm putting forth. and you know the work that. i'm doing um i really appreciate the podcast. and everything that you guys do so any advice. would help thank you thanks. bro yeah thanks i think there's just a way. to say it real plain. without sounding like you like it's the it's interesting. i feel like there's a tone of voice. thing where you can sound. like you're asking for something. because you think you deserve. it i don't have a tone. but yeah and you and you're asking for something. because you you like want to. open a conversation and i think if you do the latter. even if you do feel the first way. you will get as long. as you're not like a pushover you will. get you're more likely to. get what you want yeah. you know especially if you start. comparing like what other places. pay for the same kind. of work it's like you don't want you. don't want to. say pay me more or else i'm gonna go somewhere else but you can be like you know i've noticed just in my years. here like uh other companies i think they pay. more like and i'm just trying to. get a sense of like what the longterm. plan is because i'd like to. be here for a long. time yeah what's the upward mobility like for me. because i really want to. like move up and up. and up at this company yes. okay but let's not forget. when i went yes on the first one. i had good advice so okay. um but yeah i don't know. he could be you know. i think the advice the the the tone. you use is that like look. i'm kind of stuck between a rock. and a hard place. here because if i don't say. anything then i don't get you. know the money and if don't say it. this way but like but if i if i it's like i know how much i could be making with other companies and like i love. to work hard for you. guys and it's just like i don't i don't. want to leave i love this. company but also uh i wanna i wanna. be able to. make sure that i can live the best. life i can monetarily and so i'd love to. open up a dialogue about. how possibly like if there's something. i could be doing or or something. i'm not doing that you think that maybe i could [ __ ] i could start making some more. money or something like that. yeah i think what i said. well i mean i pretty much said what. you did but i think what i said. is a little bit better. right so rewind it depends on what the company. rewind this go back. to exactly what i said if it's a weed. company do how i did it. okay yeah sure um yeah uh that's that's uh weird. that they try they're just trying. to i don't know man. they're just trying to. take advantage of you but here's the thing. and here's really what what's deeper. in three two one you can't. uh expect people to. do anything but take advantage. of you and you cannot be. surprised and you certainly cannot take it. personally when they do it takes it everybody. would take advantage of dude. people take advantage of their [ __ ] mom if i meant 10. more grand a year you know like people will take advantage. of [ __ ] anyone under any circumstance. if they think they'll benefit themselves. don't take it personally. though because guess what you'd probably do the same. so just don't be don't take anything. personal because if you do that'll come out. in the way your voice. sounds when you approach this. [ __ ] yeah so just [ __ ] recognize that this is not personal this. is just somebody trying to. take advantage of somebody else by. paying them not up to. snuff in terms of what people. at that position usually. get yeah you don't want to. give away your money they don't want to. give away their money yeah exactly yeah yeah okay cool next one hey matt and chris daniel from cleveland ohio here um i was raised mennonite and as a mennonite you're not allowed. to wear jewelry but i have. left them in the nights. a while back now and i do enjoy wearing jewelry. but only if it means something i don't like wearing jewelry. if it doesn't mean anything. i feel like a douchebag and i think subtlety is sexy. it's the sexiest thing okay. um so how much jewelry. should guys wear and should you wear jewelry. as a guy if it really doesn't mean. anything if it's just for decoration. um second question is what's a cool. thing to pass. down to uh you know. my son i have a sevenyearold son what's it the cool. thing to pass. down to him. like a watch or something. like that obviously i'm not. getting an inheritance from my. dad that's a deeper. so i want to. pass something down to. my son when he gets married. or graduates college something like that. so yeah let me know. what you think um side. note i laid carpet at. hilarities comedy club in cleveland. so oh that's for you. chris that's cool i love that. club hilarities in cleveland. um uh he doesn't wear julie but investing. to pass down i think is a watch. because it doesn't lose. its investment doesn't lose his value. it doesn't lose his value. yeah it increases in value. it can yeah really i don't. wear watches i hate the way. they feel my wrist. uh well but i've never really given one. a shot i know people say. like keep it on for a couple. yeah why do i do that. if you don't want yeah exactly. um yeah that that's a good. thing to do there. are a lot of do how much what do. you what do you got change. i've got this this this and i have a chastity. belathon would uh calvin. give a [ __ ] about any of that. stuff that's so bad when i get a boner. well not now because well now yeah because it's fun. he would hold it you. know this he would love to. take and whip it. around but i mean when he's an adult. well i don't know i mean. he would it's you know. was there anything you think about that. you would one day hand down to. him yeah this yeah i would i would hand down this. until what is it the same christopher i've had forever. how long this is actually brand. new but this one's like since i was a teenager. it's like 18 maybe oh wow. um yeah it's cool. to pass stuff down. um you know that's a saint helps. with your travel right. i mean this is yeah this. yeah you know if you want to. if you believe in that. stuff which is cool what. is it gonna keep me. safe or something yeah yeah whatever it is i mean. so [ __ ] dismissive st christopher is keep us. safe travel yeah yeah keep us safe. okay keep us safe keep us. safe at while we travel yeah. his thing though is three words just keep us. safe oh it is okay. cool i think it i think it. was uh make america great again. but no i don't think so someone. else um he so yeah. i i you know he doesn't wear i mean. subtlety is the most sexy thing. he said i personally me. i think it's [ __ ] long legs. and tits but yeah i think i think it's like um a beautiful. face and like heavy duty. attraction that it you know. gives me bars subtlety doesn't. just like make my penis. erect in a vacuum i don't. know man you see how subtle. that was yeah i mean. you ever see the movie. uh what's that movie. that's real subtle i don't. know oh wow whatever yeah do the joke. at home what's that movie. um yeah uh i i um yeah i think that subtlety is. you know it's like you i get what. he's saying he doesn't want to. be so hey look at me. ostentatious yeah he wants to. be comfortable in his own. skin that is sexy right. yeah that is sexy yeah but also he likes. a little bit of jewelry. but also the reason why he likes probably a little bit of jewelry. is because his parents said you can't. wear jewelry so let's not let them. get all in your [ __ ] you know main frame and absolutely take over and over compensate. because let's not do that. right right right yeah okay uh yeah i just think [ __ ] ah how do you answer. this thing is cool it's like you you. want to get jewelry. just to pass. it down like i'm confused. it has to. mean something you're you're right. in saying it should mean. something but if it doesn't mean anything. you can't buy it and you can't. buy it it's like looking for love. you can't look for it. it just hits you over the side. yeah when it happens. yeah so if you see a thing. that you like cool. but also you're gonna have to. wear it for a long time. you can't just give your son. something because oh hey i found this necklace and i wore it. for a week and then here i'm passing. it on to. you i know what should happen. okay what let's get his wife. huh tell her buy him. a piece of jewelry so. then it'll have inherent meaning and then he'll have something. to pass on. to uh uh his son. right yeah so hey that guy's wife. i know you're watching buy him. some [ __ ] also that's his son seven so you don't need to. pass anything down to. him for the next 40. years but you wanted to. have some weight on it you want to. have some years like you said you don't want. to be just some necklace he's wearing for a week. you know well right but if he just buys himself. a necklace and wears it for 40. years then let's get some meaning. yeah i guess right. i bought this after i i get the guys from lifeline. gave me advice no but here's the thing. 40 years later this is why. it's a puzzle he doesn't want to. buy something that feels arbitrary. he wants it to. have meaning to. begin with okay get your wife. or your girl whoever i don't know if he's married. or not but uh leave notes. around the house that hint at what you. want yeah but don't say it. because if you say it it'll lose. it to me just walk up. to your wife and be like huh. it'd be crazy to. have something to. pass on to. my son wants that jewelry. exactly yeah i know i met. a night but it doesn't matter. i i don't remember the thing. about being a mennonite is you know. we don't believe in jewelry. but me i'm not a mennonite anymore. and i'm very happy my son. is in a minute anymore. and i feel like there's maybe a good way. to symbolize that yeah yeah visavis. jewelry i mean i don't know. though i don't know better hurry. up though because like um you know. i need to start. wearing something to. make it mean something yeah yeah that's crazy. all right cool all right. next one hey chris and matt. love your podcast i'm a huge fan. me and my boyfriend both. are um so i have a quick. question it might be a silly. question southern but my boyfriend. does not like when i bring up. my exes their names. or anything about them whatsoever good. don't know yeah i know that's probably normal. to dislike that but he gets really mad. if i ever bring up. a name good don't next. shut up so my question. is is he going a little overboard. or like can i like i can't. even share my life experiences. with him good don't know. from my past because the majority. of my past experiences involve accents. and like i want to. be able to. share things with him yeah. um nope so just let me. know if i'm being too because i want to. respect him and stuff but oh just let me know. um i'm ali i'm from south. carolina my girlfriend's philip and we love your podcast. uh we love lifeline. we love congratulations and we were gonna come see. you guys uh or see you chris. but we're gonna hopefully get to. it next time thanks um very cool. uh you're already trying not. to say anything that's all you can do. if you [ __ ] mess up every once in a while he should understand. you're making a serious effort 100. you're trying to compromise. he should meet you [ __ ] halfway. come on man yeah. she's sweet and and and and and he's doing. too much it sounds like like dude. it's gonna happen i don't like hearing. about x's and [ __ ] yeah i never really cared. yeah me either but like um i i don't i mean. i don't you know. what i mean the thing. about action you know what for me. i didn't care about if it was like relationships. where you loved somebody and like you actually. gained experience from it but like if i wanna. like hearing about exit like yeah. i met this guy at [ __ ] you know moose. mcgillicuddies and just sucked him. up in an alleyway behind a dumpster where they [ __ ] shot uh mulholland drive i don't. wanna i mean i don't. want to hear that. [ __ ] so it depends what you're saying it depends what you're saying. if you're like well you know my you remember dave. eve we went out for three. years and i learned a lot through. that that's fine but if she's like you. know it's funny man at one. time at waffle house you know. i met a waiter and he was just so. hot i waited till he got off and then i made sure i got him. off in the back of my chevelle. i sucked them up. good he hit the back. of my throat and it was nuts. well why are you getting. so mad phillip it's not like he didn't eat. my [ __ ] [ __ ] dude he wasn't just using me he lit. me up real nice outside. the [ __ ] cracker barrel at 3pm okay so so it's like i mean it depends on what you're saying because that literally if we talk to. philip he was like well i just wish you know. okay well i think it's i'm assuming. it's sort of like a given that that's not. what she's doing she's talking about her. life experiences yeah and how she was with someone. at the time the story has to. include that person yeah but at the same. at the same time it doesn't really have. to include that one. time i met a dude. outside of video shagging. i i sat on a sybian for. him for nine hours. never saw him again. got a bought a vcr. sat on a sybian for nine. hours it's it's sweet. of you and you're going above. and beyond to try. to not mention any of your exes. he needs to. [ __ ] cut you some slack. for that in the first place. he just googled sibia and that's why he's laughing. is that right no he knows. what a [ __ ] is he's an adult. man okay all right well if you don't know what a sybian is. google it everybody knows what obsidian. is you sit on it. all right i'll give you a hint you. said on it and it vibrates all right. but why by the way. sybians are weird i'll just get a dildo. no the sybian is like yeah. but it's like such a [ __ ] cumbersome device. you know you have to. put in a basement and [ __ ] sybians are like uh what like i feel like gymnasts their bar. like it's so space it's like you. have to go somewhere else to. get on a sybian yeah. there's a [ __ ] sybian uh it's like batting cages [laughter] uh let me get yeah let me get an hour [laughter] what speed in cage is just oh yeah oh yeah waiting like this [laughter] phillips why we have to. come here it reminds me. of [ __ ] gary i only got 15. minutes um hold the picture. of gary in front of me. sybians look like they're not. fun do you know. what i'm saying yeah [ __ ] violent. and really shake you up. like after you get off. a simian you're like still shaking you know. yeah yeah oh but that you're too. excited about that yeah. i watched those videos one. time and then i was like man. it's too much that's what i'm saying. so i'm saying it's just weird. to be like a [ __ ] like if you want really like exploring your body is fine and and it's fine to. bring a few things but like the second you got and you need help. bringing something in to. explore your body yeah it's like too much. yeah it's like it's like it's like [ __ ] hang gliding. like just get in a [ __ ] plane. or or bungee jump. you know what i mean. okay hang gliding you got to. learn kind of how to. do it and [ __ ] and then that first time you do it you gotta run off the cliff. and just kind of hope for the best. you know that's so scary. the first time yeah you're like here. we go okay i hope. it works and then somebody's like some people are like here we go. i hope it works how it works. you know what i mean. like literally that's that happened. you practice so much for hang gliding. and then you're just like here we go. here we go here we go. you know and you die. you spend what months [ __ ] practicing that's basically what a sybian. is he said you don't. die on the city. no you probably there have been sibians. how many sibian deaths do you think there's been ever. in history even if there's one i had more than one because if there's one that would be more. than one but that would be so shitty. if you were known as the [ __ ] sybian dad. i bet there's six sybian related. deaths in history oh i think i say a year no just ever. all right well fine one more all right. this guy sent in three separate. videos okay well that's not except back. to back oh okay wow wow okay. so be patient here. we go what's going. on chris i'm matt sorry. i gotta talk really fast. but you guys won't
