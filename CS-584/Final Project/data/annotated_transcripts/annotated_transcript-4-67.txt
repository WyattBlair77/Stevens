[ __ ] snake chain on dude if you're watching i have a sneaking but i'm wearing it on the inside just to. let you know that under it. all i'm still a little bit. dmx dude i i don't really. know where to start. this podcast to be honest. it's cuz yesterday was. the day that i don't want to. start with on too much. of a down downer but like [ __ ] i found out. you know kobe bryant died. like a noon yesterday. when i was waking up. bright and early at noon. and i just couldn't believe it. man i couldn't i couldn't believe it. it's so [ __ ] weird that he died. and the way he did i gotta say first. of all i cried like all day. which i'm not trying to. make it about me. but it's so [ __ ] weird that i cried. all day because i didn't really i don't care. about basketball i don't i don't know. much about kobe except for you. know he you know he played basketball. he's one of the greatest. of all time and and i just don't i don't. know if i i didn't know i cared. that much and then when i found that out about how he's 41. in a helicopter crash i don't i also like i'd never witnessed somebody. a turn the air off. it's bugging me i never noticed about i never noticed. how much like there. was so in my life. somebody dying like prematurely or like even the robin. williams thing or the michael jackson i was 29 when michael jackson died. and robin williams when he died. was like six years ago. and robin williams was in like in my circle. in my life like like we talked about him. all the time i'm a comedian. he was a comedian i met. robin williams once and talked with him. for a little bit and just that. was rough but for some reason. the kobe bryant thing really. [ __ ] hit me hard. like i mean maybe it's because we're the same. age maybe it's because i'm gonna be a dad or some [ __ ] and his daughter. was in the helicopter and it just really [ __ ] and it [ __ ] me up the whole. day and i had a show in irvine. and i wasn't sure if i was gonna be able. to do it the way. i do i mean i knew i'd be able. to go on stage. and you know i'm a professional i'll be. able to get on stage. and do this [ __ ] but i wasn't sure if i was gonna you know give be able to. do it a hundred percent. now you know i was able. to i got on stage. and it was all good. it was fine which i don't know. maybe but i just like was crying. for i four or five times i just like people. would send me videos. of what of him. and then an hour. before showtime i was like all right. you guys you got to. stop man like i can't i'm gonna be like [ __ ] upset. on stage i just didn't know. i'm surprised how big of a [ __ ] deal he was. to the world like there's nobody who didn't know who kobe bryant was. everybody knows who kobe bryant is. edit your [ __ ] seven years. old you know who kobe bryant is. and he only retired. like three years ago. which i didn't even realize three. four years ago. it's still fun it kind of felt like he played. basketball in a way and then the thing the other night like then take ten. hours before lebron passed him. and in scoring or whatever. it was and and then kobe was. in the news the night. before and then in the news. for being celebrated and then in the news. for being so in such a tragedy. it was just so [ __ ] awful man i just my heart goes out to. his family and and any i mean. dude i was watching some of the clips. like people were just talking about how like he put la he made la. cool again he made la. it's just i don't realize like you. know i make fun of my opener a lot. because he likes sports. and he's [ __ ] 35 and he like he doesn't pull he's a comedian. i'm like bro just hang it up. you know like stop shooting a basketball. at the ymca you're [ __ ] 35 have a child you know namine work on your jokes. the guy's so competitive it's like he's like you don't think i can. [ __ ] jump further than you i'm like bro. i don't give a [ __ ] mm 39 you know. if you're not getting paid to. do anything with a ball give it up. when you're 24 but my opener is just like let's go. let's go let's [ __ ] play you don't think i could do it. i'm like i don't not only do i not even. think or not think i don't. care but the point. is is basketball when there's somebody like that that transcends it. it's about an idea it's about it's not even. him which is it is him. because you know he's a real. person i don't want to. take that away from him you know. you you you make these people out to. be bigger than they really. are and and you think about how they don't have you know. you don't think of them. as like real people but he was a very real person. but like it becomes about it. becomes an idea you know. like kobe bryant was an idea. and he was helping women's. basketball he you know the way. he was with his daughter. and she wanted to. be in the [ __ ] wnba. and that's just beautiful i mean. there's this clip on i think it's jimmy. kimmel talking about how kobe was. just like you know he's talked about his daughter. and they were saying about how like oh yeah don't you feel. bad that you don't have any. sons you know you need someone to. carry on your legacy and his daughter will cut him. off and be like wow that's me. i'm the legacy and then how he was like yeah. you're right you are the legacy. and that's just so awesome. that he had his daughters. [ __ ] back like that you know i mean look it's hard. enough for [ __ ] women in in certain ways and just the fact that he was like an al and ally for his daughters. and like it was just [ __ ] so awesome. and it's it's it's like people need that. and now that he died. in such a weird [ __ ] way. it's about the idea it's about the idea. that died too and but yeah but but here's the thing. the idea didn't die because you still have. that idea you know it's it's it. still lives on he's bigger. than the person he was which is [ __ ] man. i mean you know it's more. than 99.9% of people can say and that's a beautiful. [ __ ] thing and it's so tragic. the way he died. and it's so tragic. the way his you know. how it how it happened. but i mean no but it's tragic. however there is also the idea that lives on and that is just it's so special. men you know i don't get too. serious on this podcast. too much because we like to. have a silly goose time. and you know that's my idea that. i want to. [ __ ] get out there but when there's a you know and that's [ __ ] but there's a real idea behind kobe kobe bryant and and it's just you know it's really touching man for a guy like me for a guy like for a guy like me who doesn't even [ __ ] watch basketball you know there were kids out there was nine year olds out there that were that were like mourning the the loss of kobe bryant and and 50 year olds out there that were at the staples center that was they were like you know and and and you know it's always a shame when somebody like that dies because they're not able to. witness the love for them. and and the and the togetherness that it. you know it brings us all together. afterwards and they're not able to. see it like even my buddy. brody stevens who who was a victim. of suicide like he who you know he killed himself. and like to see that. guy was always insecure about. people liking him he thought. people didn't like him he thought you know and he was one. of the funniest guys i've [ __ ] ever met in my life. and i would see him all the time. at the comedy store and he was a friend. of mine and he killed himself. and and and just the rallying that the the people. the community that the comedians and then the people outside of people. working mean it just fans. that just got behind the idea. of brody stephens it's it's a beautiful. it's a sad but beautiful. thing and it's also a shame that. that person can never see. it because he would have loved to. see it and you know i don't know it. just make makes me think you know. people say like grab your loved ones. and let them know you love. them and and i suppose. that's very important but my heart. goes out man and that sucks and it's just a tragedy. and hopefully in a few weeks. or months or however. a year however long it. takes you to. grieve like you can just start. celebrating the idea that kobe bryant was. and and that's that you know. i mean i think about tupac. all the time i know. i make jokes about how [ __ ] you know. i got i got this [ __ ] on a loop. here you know and that's not really. the idea that tupac was behind [ __ ] someone's [ __ ] but it was the you know to. me to park [ __ ] transcend hiphop and transcended his rap. music like i [ __ ] he got me through [ __ ] certain times in you know as silly as it is it suburban white kid but like high school and college and [ __ ] like that and now whenever some [ __ ] goes down in the back of my head a little bit [ __ ] you beat and it helps but you know love or whatever out there to. all the all the people that are affected. by this god i can't believe how many people i've never witnessed something. even the michael jackson thing i know it. was i know michael jackson was probably. bigger than kobe but i've never seen. something like like this. on for a celebrity that. died anyway that's that's the real [ __ ] and now we'll try to. have a silly goose time. i mean i'm not i don't ever. promise you anything it is what. it is and we fly by. the seat of our pants. my babies and it's all good. but it's cool it's also cool to. me that someone can like like lebrons. like this like that someone can [ __ ] be so in the spotlight i mean and and under a microscope. and just i mean lebron just take lebron like dude. where's his scandal how is lebron just basically you know. jesus like i don't want to. [ __ ] get the catholics mad even though who cares but like even though who [ __ ] cares right cuz it doesn't matter right i don't want to. piss off the catholics but on one hand i don't want to. piss out the catholics but on the other hand cares. right couldn't care a rat's. ass you know i'm talking. about so why is lebron so perfect how come nobody's like yeah. lebron [ __ ] got mad and choked me like bro who is that one chris webber was that the guy who's the guy that choked the dude that guy wasn't even [ __ ] lebron and he was like i'm gonna choke someone how the [ __ ] do you get everything lebron the guy has got the greatest family great you know he's got planes and houses he listens to. music on instagram and makes this face that's his scandal. that's it him turning it up. on instagram that guy is. there a dm out there. that can expose him. you know the guy's [ __ ] unreal. and just but my point. is how does he like if someone [ __ ] with lebron i feel like ron. will be like nah that's not worth. my time i'm bigger than that. i want to. be the bigger person bro. how do you have everything. and also be the bigger person. if i had everything i'm gonna be a small person. if i had [ __ ] more than two pools i'm getting smaller dude i swear to. god if i get a [ __ ] on like if i if you ever see me if i ever get a plane if i ever get a plane i get for real someone's gonna have to. throw me in because i'm gonna be that's a bit i swear. to god ladder they'll be like i with other. nighter that ladder down dude. are you kidding me. probably put me up. to chuck me in there. mm small person now anytime some [ __ ] goes down mm patty any time some [ __ ] goes down somebody could be like you know i'll do it i'm petty now bro i have to. force myself to. not clap back on. these trolls in [ __ ] twitter dude. i have to force myself. not to it when someone talks.

the [ __ ] truth. newscaster bring it when the newscaster said the la. lakers remember when she said that did you guys see this i mean it went viral. the other day but the lady. basically was it's talking about kobe bryant wait. no which don't michael bryan. yeah she was and it was the la. lakers and she was gonna say knicks and she said la makers and it did not sound like makers and also nakos even sounds bad so she said it and and it was so and it was so like what the [ __ ] because she said it quick and there were people that actually thought that it was an outrage that she said the nword which is absolutely [ __ ] insane to. me like imagine being so racist. and insane but also you were able. to climb the ladder. at as a newscaster to. get to the point. where you're like no matter. what here it goes. this is the moment i've been waiting. for when one of the most beloved. athletes of all time dies. prematurely i've got it i've got my chance. on the worldwide stage to. slip in the nword and let everybody. know like there are people that actually think she said that. and she's racist which is. so [ __ ] insane she obviously made a [ __ ] goof but people are going to. want people are trying to. cancel this lady the fact that this lady. even has to apologize for na. for saying nay kurz is ludicrous but here it is and it does sound. bad i mean and said it dude. took a break and said the nword took a break. took a breath and was just like let her rip my babies. i'm racist and i can't. help it anymore you know what [ __ ] it here we go i know i know it's taboo. but gotta say it also the worst. time you know it couldn't have. been a worse time. literally literally couldn't be in a worse. time one of the most famous. beloved black people of all time died and she couldn't have said it at a worse time. died fresh one hour before that and she had to. slip in the nword hilarious. anyway she obviously didn't [ __ ] do that so lay off. her case it was a mistake. she meant to say [ __ ] nix i think she said which is crazy. as it is because nix have nothing. to do with it but that's what her. explain explanation was i guess. she kind of does kind of owe. an explanation because it really does. sound like the n word still a there. be great if she just said [ __ ] the like a gay slur like the one that began. with f and we were like i'm so sorry. i meant to say fire. hydrant and maggots like wait what that. really i just hate gays but that's just i just hate. gays i couldn't help it. couldn't help it um i i just think it's how about [ __ ] ari shaffir dude. this guy is a troll it's the weirdest. thing about ari man. let me play this or you want. to bring it up. it's the weirdest thing about ari. it's like i know ari. and he's always been the [ __ ] nicest guy to. me like just all like i don't judge people. i try not to. judge people unless like until i've met. them and the guys like legitimately one. of the nicest guy he's so nice. every now and then he texas. i haven't talked him in maybe over a year but like every now and then he texts. me and he's also done. no [ __ ] like he he texted me. once that comics weren't getting. paid enough and he was like i'm trying. to sign this position. petition for comics to. get paid and i was like that's really sweet. and then he [ __ ] dosed bert kreischer it. with his family and and did this [ __ ] and it's just so but he just i understand. he's a troll but he wrote kobe. bryant died 20 years. too late today he got away. with rape because all hollywood rule ibrahim adiy enjoy rooting for lakers but play the [ __ ] in the video that rappaport tweeted. it if you look on his and it's also probably all over. youtube but but yeah like he just did. this thing and here's the thing. here's the weird thing about let me let me actually. play it and then and then i'll get to. it i mean all day. rappaport's been [ __ ] it was such a sports. fan i mean couldn't be posting more kobe [ __ ]. i love michael rapaport he's such a [ __ ] nice dude. but no it's not understand. on instagram he took it down no. so i get pissed right. because one fire is. taking too long and i could have. found it already but i get pissed. so he linked it. up to put it on his computer. and play the audio. on his computer but no i pissed. off because the first thing you do when you pipe. in a literally comes up. ari shaffir kobe video and he. just went too far and put ari shaffir and then clicked on only only ari. shaffir and that's when i get pissed. off now it's fine. because i'm trying to. be an idea and i don't want to. be petty but here it is. play it pain in the world. it's always a bunch of terrible. stories every once in a while there's a good story good. story comes out the guy who got away. with rape got his today hopi bryan. is i'm gone i'm here at charlotte. the homewood team that originally. drafted him maybe wouldn't break. that chick in denver if he'd been maybe it stayed in charlotte. with the hornets anyway. is that it um it's so weird. that he did that i know. he's a troll and here's other thing. too people are like you know. it's calm some people who are defending. him are like it's comedy. it's comedy which yeah and they're like well. where's the joke and i think look re is playing a character. that and and he obviously. gets off on trolling people. like it's what he wants. and okay and it's insane. to me like it's [ __ ] utterly insane. that he wants people to. [ __ ] hate him like he's a heel i get it. okay if this was the wwf he would. be [ __ ] hollywood hogan or whatever. but bro people are not gonna know you're joking. and also there's not really a joke. in there he's just kind of like trying. to get people eight people on and also here's the other thing. dude you're gonna get your ass. kicked like you're a comedian. people always know where you are. this when they my jaw. dropped when he did this. and i guess the whole idea is he wants. people to talk about it. and [ __ ] like that but [ __ ] man i mean it's bad to. do that it's just i don't know man. and the other thing too is. like he he's like jojo. like a lot of you'll know he is from. joe rogan and so people are tagging joe. rogan come get your boy. like you got to. think about like that dude. like oh god i don't understand. when people like wannabe so i don't understand. i don't even know i don't even. get it like i just don't get how it isn't the idea. as a community to. put butts in seats. like people are just gonna boycott you i guess. he's trying to find the [ __ ] real dregs of the earth. that are just like me. and [ __ ] yeah that's a weird fanbase though. man i mean people even comedians are so many cuz that's the thing. it's kind of bad for comedy. to do [ __ ] like that because people are like oh well he's gonna here we go hide them. behind [ __ ] like it's a joke. and you're gonna just say it's a joke. right and comedians just can say. anything without repercussions and it's like yeah. well we're supposed to. be able to. but also make it funnier. than that dude make it a little bit. i don't know wink or something. so you don't get killed. it's a it's a weird thing for me. to see do it. cuz like i said our has always been super nice. to me and to. see him just do that. is just so [ __ ] weird what a lunatic. what a lunatic dude i always think it's weird. this is not you know. i don't know if ari does. this or not i'm talking. about some house. now but like i was think it's weird. that when like somebody dies. or whatever the [ __ ] something happens kid gets molested it gets exposed like comedians just raced to. twitter and like are like i let me come up. with the best joke. so it'll pop off and it's just like dude. give it time man. or like what about the families. i guess you know i honestly. felt weird posting i haven't posted since kobe died. because i felt weird because i don't really post. about serious [ __ ] you know i've kind of made it a point. to not post about serious. [ __ ] because i don't you know it's comedy. i want to. do comedy mostly the 95%. of the time um i probably owe more. than 95% of the time. but so serious posts always kind of make me feel weird. to do as a comedian. and i'm not saying i never do. it or i sure you should never do. it if you are a comedian. but um [ __ ] i'd totally lost my train. of thought but yeah i just i just feel like it's weird. to even post about anything. besides kobe right now because everybody knows about it. and it would just be weird. to be like here's a funny. video i made uh i guess out of respect. i don't know morning. i don't know uh not sure. really i don't know what to. say about that or anything. man that was [ __ ] crazy and here's the other thing too like people are like i want to. [ __ ] him up i want to. [ __ ] beat the [ __ ] out of him that's not the answer either i mean i know there's a bit that i don't want to. ruin the bit but what's his name. chris de stefano mate was. doing this funny bit about how very generally like people. people i love chris. de stefano man love. this dude and it was he was talking about how people need to. get people on twitter say. anything because they're behind the keyboard. and they need to. get punched in the mouth. though like you need to. get punched in the mouth. people like that need to. get punch about and that's a reason. why they're behind of keyboards. because they need to. get punched in the mouth. whatever it's [ __ ] hilarious obviously what i said wasn't just funny. because it's not my bit and i just [ __ ] was explaining it. but and i don't want to. say the funny part because it's his material. you should go see him. but he you know if punched in the mouth. is one thing but like people are like tweeting. addresses their tweet like that [ __ ] is [ __ ] crazy bro. these people need to. get get check punched in the mouth. is one thing but do it. don't incite a [ __ ] mob that is insane. all right liz your address. this is a person's address. this is everyone's address. go ahead like that's i don't. know i don't think that's the answer. man i don't think that's the answer. i know some people have done some bad. [ __ ] but you got to. let the [ __ ] whatever it is the authorities or the people that are the powers that be i don't know man. all right i got to. do these [ __ ] ads here here we go kaptara if you

cuda. to not do something that you like because other people say. you shouldn't for example liking. a shirt certain show or reading. comics or things like that. glue argument good argument i think people i think it's more. about the hive mind. like people don't think for themselves. being a cuda distilled that's a term if you're if you're new to. the congratulations podcast you're a cuda. it comes from being a barracuda. barracudas just see shiny objects and gravitate towards them. you cuda right like coachella. is cuda because maybe you don't even. like the band's plane but you're like gotta go. cuz everyone else is going. right so like a comic or like certain show. watching it it just just watching it. isn't cuda like if you're at home. and you're like let me see what. this [ __ ] watchman is all about because people are talking about it that's not cuda but if you don't get it. and you're like i still got to. watch it and then somebody talks about how good it. is and you don't think it's good. and you're like oh no. yeah it's great it. code but just doing it you know. things become popular and and they're popular for a reason. but you know it's always a fine. line man and we all have a little bit. of cuda in us and i always say this. you know you have to. have a little bit of cuda. it's cuz if you don't you're dead. you're not [ __ ] you're a cold body but yeah so i can't really answer that. question be harder but ya. know i know the answer is no. it's not cuda just to. do something that other people. like because you have to. learn what you like anyway anyway.
