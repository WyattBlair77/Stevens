[ __ ] i mean here's that here's how i know i'm an old guy iiii don't know about this. i didn't know about asmr. until recently now a lot of you. guys who listen to. my podcast i'm not gonna know it. as some are as i know. because a lot of you guys. are adults and a lot. of you guys are younger. and do know what a asmr. is okay i didn't know what it. was but it's this. [ __ ] thing where they youtube. these these people youtube is usually like young. girls that do it which it's which definitely it's definitely this. first okay asmr is like well okay. here's the definition autonomous sensory meridian. response is an experience characterized by a static like or tingling sensation. on the skin that typically. begins on the scalp and moves. down the back the neck. and the upper spine. i mean [ __ ] who wrote this trina it has been compared with auditory tactical sin. i mean sis. sin nastia oh yeah [ __ ] this [ __ ] [ __ ] these words anyway lowgrade euphoria a combination of positive positive feelings and a distinct static like tingling sensation on the skin alright look so people will make these video you these youtubes and they'll just like be like redhead that's getting me and all this is like [ __ ] nine years old and she's like and then a car will drive by in the background it should be like and she tries to. make her lips like so. it's gross as [ __ ] to. be honest like i don't to. hear that i'll just spit. in your mouth they're just like and then they'll eat the gummies. and rigo like and people like jizz. to it or something. but they'll be like they call them. triggers what's their scalp. to tingle they'll be like and and then he'll be like this. and then they'll just scratch. they'll be like this and then a car will drive. by oh should be like and then they'll be like like don't like what what are. the popular is some are triggers though. one of them is like [ __ ] now there was a bob was watching a video of it. the other day and it was like but like it's here's the thing. it's [ __ ] definitely there's that top10 triggers for a samar that's the one i was looking at know. the by the fourth one. like the fifth one. or whatever and it's like the tapping listen. to this [ __ ] i got a i got a [ __ ] play some of this actually on this youtube it's weird and here's the thing this is the thing that i want i want it to. bring it up this. is the thing i wanted to. bring up by the way. is that if you're listening to. this and you're [ __ ] you're a guy it's you can't fool. us that it's not sexual you. perv okay don't watch these [ __ ] look at this. yet what they say. here we go here i just don't. understand old guy but these asmr closeup ear. to ear positive affirmations for anxiety. and sleep like this she's fluttering. her hands you hear all the spit. in her mouth no you're not you're whispering she's talking. about dude she's talking about like helping people. and like making sure that they're like in good. not i guess not depressed. or some [ __ ] and like take care of yourself. in your wellbeing but and she's doing the whisper. thing the whole time. she's like hey say it louder hey is it. important say it louder look at how how many views. i mean i'm the [ __ ] wrong one here like five hundred and seventy seven thousand. views ah oh how many of those. are old dudes getting [ __ ] boners for real straightup. you're getting boners bro you can't. fool me that it's about making the top. of your scalp tingle it's about making your boner. go up you know it's it's [ __ ] weird to. me i get uncomfortable when i watch asmr. [ __ ] man makes me uncomfortable i don't give a [ __ ] obviously but there is a [ __ ] fan base for everything like the internet like take take the mm and mgk dish now there's way too many people being like nm is the best don't [ __ ] with him and in his way too many people be like mgk came as [ __ ] fire though and then after and then a bunch of people be like mgk oh that was ridiculous that was horrible and then hey remember when like things used to. be like unanimously good remember like in like the 90s. u2 was just amazing. you know and now people are like the internet. brought the haters out dude. it's amazing dude it's really amazing. because like here's the thing when we're talking about. like everyone complaining and [ __ ] about everything most people aren't happy. with what they have that's just how it is. okay so therefore most of those. people not everyone but most of those people are going. to complain okay so that's a lot. of people who are just complaining now. the internet is now very big everyone. has it so most of what you're going. to hear is complaining therefore we have no. choice but to. become a world full of hating. [ __ ] that's what's up now. i'm joking about this. asmr [ __ ] like if you like it you like it fine but like and i'm turning to. this this is turned into. a different point and then it is kind of devolved. as this podcast usually. does just devolve into. [ __ ] nothing but yeah it that it's just that's that's that's that's what is [ __ ] up about this world and the internet and we're all going to. become a bunch of huge [ __ ] and we haven't even seen the beginning. of it yet we are going. to become huge [ __ ] and then something else has to. happen and i don't know. what it is yet. i don't know what it is. yet maybe we're going to. be what do you call. it a bunch of we're gonna be a bunch of them. what do you call. it uh it's gonna be a pulse and pocketable. get up explode the world's gonna [ __ ] kill. it we're all gonna kill. us others gonna be [ __ ] a third of the population left. as you me like one. of those [ __ ] netflix movies that extinction. movie we're all gonna [ __ ] die. and there's only gonna be a few left. and it's all gonna be because the [ __ ] mgk eminem and asmr. and [ __ ] like that and people hating on the internet. mmhmm i don't know that. barely makes any sense. but this is what you get you. know let's talk about why. the [ __ ] every time every time i see [ __ ] i follow mark wahlberg on instagram every time i see mark wahlberg on instagram it's a [ __ ] new video about how he woke up earlier every single time i have [ __ ] it started that like you know you know you don't want to. burn daylight right you got it. you can't pretend like right. you got to wake up. i'll wake up at 7:00 a.m. and i get working. out i wake up at 7:00. m/m a.m. and i carry kettlebells. i carry kettlebells from one. end to the other of the of my gym. and i got a [ __ ] workout got buddy. and he makes me carry my kettlebells. from one end to. the other and then [ __ ] the next like three days a ders i kind of wake up. at 6:00 a.m. gotta wake up. at 6:00 a.m. and you gotta push this.
