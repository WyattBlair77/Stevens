ready to go but she says com you know maybe this is going to be a good she's got this new saying that is like an old saying that's like good news bad news who knows bad news good news who knows and they're like sometimes bad news is good news you just have no [ __ ] idea and i'm like okay fair enough you know so uh i go up and do the guy couldn't have been nicer and i kept it cool and it couldn't have been nicer the guy at jetblue it's called jetblue y or some [ __ ] [ __ ] why why it's called like jetblue it's like a station of jetblue that they have where you go and everything's [ __ ] up it's not called like you like uh customer service they call it some [ __ ] like why did this happen or something jetblue how come i don't even know what it's called jetblue oops it's called [ __ ] i don't know what it is but we went to the desk and this lady did the thing where even though i was first you cut a line and it was fine whatever because everyone's all [ __ ]. and i was like what are we gonna do. dude and we had a layover in jfk. and instead dude they gave us. a [ __ ] straight shot dude they made up for it straight. shot baby so we did. it got to. london in the airport dude. i was in the airport. and i was like i'm gonna go get some water. and i go to. get a [ __ ] i could get that smart. water you know so the guy. at the thing he was like this. dude that was making so many. jokes to. people and he says to. me i get there and he says now. has anyone told you and i go here. we go here we go. and it's all good this is. the life that i lead here. we go and he says has anyone told you something. you don't know before and i said it. was one of those sentence. that it felt like oh oh okay. so this is not okay. somebody whoops somebody stole my brain. i i'm just what's going. on i'm looking for my brain. because here's the thing that sentence. is one of those things. that like when you you know. when you look at those paintings with the artist. and they do like they do paintings. of like somebody with two sets of eyes. and you're like are there you know. is there one or what if it's just it's like a thing. like if you look up a artist. who puts two sets of eyes. like one right on top. of each other it's like a [ __ ] some artist. does that and you look. at him and you're just like is it. and you know there's four eyes. but you're still like there's two wait. it's my mind is just or like they'll. have like does this shape. fit in this thing or this. thing and you're like well that. one's way smaller but it. fits in both and you're like but how does what is it. and it's like an optical illusion. but for four words he did. it he didn't this. [ __ ] did an optical illusion. with words dude he says has anyone told you something. you don't know before and at first. i think well uh yeah because all that. would be is like hey you know. flounders have two eyes on only one side. of their body and no eyes. on the other oh that's something. i didn't know before somebody told me. that or i read. it so yes but then i think but the only answer to. that is yes because no matter who you are. somebody's told you something you don't know. before so it can't be what he means. right unless somebody stole my brain. and i just can't figure it out. so instead i feel like i i realize the only thing that i can possibly. say to this man. is what because then surely he'll. clear it up so he says to. me has anyone told you something you don't know. before and then i quickly assess the situation with the brain. that is still in my head. and i hit him with what. and then he says has anyone told you something. you don't know before so now. i'm [ __ ] because he doubled down this is what he meant. but surely he's behind a counter. so he deals. with people and deals. with things and situations. so he's capable i guess and i'm just holding the [ __ ] smart. water and so i say well. what do you mean. and he says you really resemble keanu. reeves and i say oh yeah well i have heard that before and he says yeah and i said well that's not so bad he's cool and he says yeah hey guy just tell me i look like keanu reeves has anyone told you something that's when my friend walked up to. this [ __ ] chick and he and he meant to. say like hey have we met. before or something or whatever. instead he wrote he walked up. to her and said do you know. who i am right. now dude and we never forgot. it man do you know. who i am right. [laughter] now jake but also i'm always jake um. dude i went into. the pool the other day. i feel like here's the thing. dude i have an assistant and some and she uses our pool sometimes. which is [ __ ] radical i love it. because the pool gets used and uh she told me. that the [ __ ] uh pool guy was like oh there's a shortage on chlorine and like whatever. dude there there's always a shortage on everything. now ever since covid. and they making it up. half the time you know. they're making it up they'll be like there's a shortage on [ __ ] there's actually a shortage on cocacola or [ __ ] water. you know and you're like really yeah there's a shortage on cardboard boxes. ever since got it you can't get anything. if you want to. get so there's a shortage on chlorine. so i just got to. take it because i don't know what am. i going to pretend. i know more about pools. than this [ __ ] so i'm like okay well when when can we get it he's like probably a month or two i said can we swim in our pool and he says sure it's fine it's not a big deal. and it's gonna have like a big party. and just don't [ __ ] in it then i say well you know about the anus. thing like sometimes just with your anuses. if you got a little diarrhea. in it on your ankle. sometimes the anus has [ __ ] pebbles on it. you can't help it. and then it's just in the pool. what if it's in there and it goes well. it's fine you know. just don't be [ __ ] in the pool. so i'm like all right. cool we won't get in the pool. but i have a twoyearold. i gotta make sure he's not sitting in the pool. and we get [ __ ] you know we all get [ __ ] up but i get in the pool and i get to. pull with calvin the next. day boom i wake up. my uvula is swollen yes dude yes my uvula. is swollen now does that. sound for those of you that don't know what a uvula. is does it sound like something. that resides in a course it. does is it no. it's the back thing in the [ __ ] that hangs out. from the back of your [ __ ] okay in the mouth when you all the cartoons when they go ah and the camera looks in it you see that you have your dangling that. little [ __ ] that that [ __ ] uh what do you call it the the the boxing [ __ ] the speed bag. that little speed bag in the back. your mouth that's called the uvula. it doesn't reside in a put resides in. your mouth the only time it resides in. a put i guess is when someone's being bored. because they have a uv layer. in their mouth but anyway too far but anyway. so um well this is gonna be restricted. this video but it's all good. my babies share it with somebody share it with somebody but that was also medical. and science and this. is a uvula and they do. reside where i said before. if they didn't catch me the first time. but they resided where they said before. uh where i said before. so i get out of the pool. the next day i wake up. swelling you of your life. yes dude [ __ ] yeah man whoa and i say to. my assistant great i got a [ __ ] thing from the algae in my pool and she's like she laughs you know because she knows me she's like he didn't get the [ __ ] thing from that algae in your pool and i was like okay well i'm just saying dude they got a chlorine shortage and the [ __ ] pool guy's being lazy and he can't hook us up with the chlorine [ __ ] it's like it's crack cocaine we gotta find a new guy a new dealer. and we can't get it. in the pool and uh she's like it's fine. so okay so a few weeks. go by i get in the pool. again dude the day. before we go to. london i wake up. [ __ ] yeah dude got a speed bag in the back. of my mouth again swollen uvula time. baby swollen [ __ ] uvula time. dude this time it's fat as [ __ ] dude. this time i can lay it. flat on the back of my tongue. it looks like jabba the hut. okay your boy's got a swollen uvula. it's disgusting but i go. okay last time it lasted a day. let's hope it only lasts. a day because then i'm going. to be nervous about bringing covert. to [ __ ] to all the people who [ __ ] you know because your boy went to. london i got [ __ ] covered. i'm spreading covered all. around different angles. of [ __ ] big pen you know i don't want that. right the next day i wake up. youvel is gone so she says and all of a sudden. my assistant just says it's not the pool. i said well it's just a coincidence that. it happened two times and she said look if it happens. four times then it maybe is your pull and i was like what. what the [ __ ] you just making some [ __ ] up willy nilly she's like four times means that so i'll let you know next two times if i got a [ __ ] speed back that's just relaxing on the back of my tongue dude like jabba the hut after i get out the pool because chlorine there's a chlorine shortage i don't know it's like has anyone told you something that you don't know before so uh that's what's been happening in my life and then i get to. the [ __ ] thing and there's a flight delay. dude and i'm at the flight. delay and dude check this. out they got to. do we got the straight shot but so i had a first the first leg. of my [ __ ] was the guy was so helpful dude. he was super helpful the first leg. of my [ __ ] was la to. jfk and then the second and that. was jetblue mint we. sit back we relax we have a good. time we go we go. horizontal if i can't go horizontal. in a flight i ain't. going all right yeah it costs. bags but dude okay there's a difference between being uncomfortable. when you arrive and [ __ ] being super spry. and cool and keeping it nice. and in a good mood. because you laid horizontal. right um so we get a all the way. to jfk we land. and then we gotta board. an american airlines flight from jfk. to heathrow ally okay. now we all the american. airlines did something happen with their computer. and like overnight they canceled. 12 000 flights in june or july. 12 000 flights in july. they just canceled them. got all [ __ ] up we all have to. rebook so i go to. the [ __ ] jet blue whoopsie. daisy or whatever the [ __ ] the thing is called did you look it up what it's called jet blue how come jet blue oops jet blue wow that's what the sign says ginkgo oops um so uh i get to. i get to the thing. and he's like um okay so the flight's canceled. canceled we're gonna miss our connection. so so what do we do and i'm ready. for him so this is your fault. so what do we do and he says oh god. and i go great and he says we don't have another. flight to. london for another two. days and i say well at that point. we'll just have to. come back around immediately. so what are we gonna do. and he says let me look you. know what i can do. you know what it's a connecting. flight let me actually see if i can call them. to in jfk to. hold the flight until you land. and i say what and he says so in some cases i i'm able. to call and have them hold up. a plane if you're not going to. make a connection or something like that and i'm like is this a famous. thing or [music] he says sometimes. we can do it and i say and it's like legal. and you guys can actually do this. you've done it before. and he says oh yeah and i'm like oh airlines. are full of [ __ ] sorry we can't open the door. you're late oh no you're full of [ __ ] i just found out. dude because some really nice gay. man behind the [ __ ] jet blue oopsy daisy station told me that you can hold up a [ __ ] flight just cause oh sorry we closed the door oh no no no no have you ever been to. jetblue oopsy daisy in lax in terminal. five no you haven't talked. to the very nice gay. man probably and ask him. to hold up the plane. open the door i don't know. if you know that they can do. that but they can do. that dude and then i came back and asked my assistant about it. because she used to. be a flight attendant and she said. yes they can do that. and i go where's everyone hiding this. information dude it's [ __ ] so i got on the plane. straight shot he got us. a straight shot so now we're on the plane. ten and a half hours i watch movies. bro i'm so excited to. watch movies and just do nothing lay horizontal. and watch [ __ ] movies i watch bad movies good i

that. movie was terrible dude they phoned it. in dude they should honestly. make a liam neeson movie. called phone in the phonein and he's just like he's just running. after bad guys and you don't even. know what they did because basically that's where they're at. already you don't even know. where they did and like like like they honestly. they should kidnap the bad. guy should kidnap somebody and then he should be like i've got to. get the girl and then halfway through i think you should switch. to calling them bank robbers even. though they didn't rob a bank and like just be like we got to. get the money back. and then the girl disappears you're not in it. anymore and then at the end he gets all the money. back and like keep some for the wife. that's dying like slides her. off some

didn't read the script. really sure that's the la most. of the lines are sure. let's get him um and uh so i watched. eternals and it was [ __ ] you know the one of the better. marvel movies and then um i watched. the green knight dude. sup hey i watched that. movie that hollywood loved the green. knight hey wow didn't even. mean to hey didn't even. mean to hit the button hey. i watched the green night. that the [ __ ] academy lauded. hey sup [laughter] i saw the green. knight with that guy dev patel. or whatever from hereditary and they [ __ ] put him in it the guy's [ __ ] he's playing a white guy he's indian. dude whatever got no. problem with that one equal opportunity for everyone. but saw the movie and got one quest. sup that movie man. did you see it oh. man i was halfway. through getting mighty pissed. off just like sup. sup i'm watching the movie. sup dude sup i'm watching. a movie i'm like [ __ ] nicholas cajun that one scene that he had definitely adlibbed in in the [ __ ] movie that was remade. by uh the one that used to. be a harvard guy. tell bad lieutenant or whatever and now he remade it and it's nicholas cage he walks into. the guy and he keeps saying sup. sup something i was trying. to do his lines. nicholas cage is like sup dude. that's me watching green night. cause hollywood shop dude. i i i mean in the in the movie. dude all right so look i'm watching a movie. and i'm gonna get to. the london trip i'll get to. it dude because boy do i have some good [ __ ] about that and this podcast might be extra long but dude. i'll get to it but so i'm watching. the green knight dude. and in the beginning dude. it's king arthur who's white and then he's got a nephew that's indian. for some reason or whatever it is don't mean. to be racist but i just said i like kamel so it's all. good dude sup. now i'm watching the [ __ ] green knight. and dev patel or whatever his [ __ ] name is um that sounds like a color. in a crayola box his name oh can you get me. the dev patel please. the burnt dev patel. and so uh so so i get the [ __ ] uh i'm watching the movie and dev patel's there. and king arthur is like dying. he's playing somebody who definitely played. a james bond bill and no question. dude no question this. guy played a james bond villain. whoever the king arthur guy is and all he does. is talk miles because he's dying or whatever. a british and uh dev patel. comes and there's christmas. and they're all making merry which is. a phrase that [ __ ] went out. which we got to. bring back dude and um while they're eating. making murray um they're in a circular. table and then this [ __ ] green tree giant knight comes in on a [ __ ] green horse with a green axe and a branch now i'm like k. but i'm like hey hollywood and alrighty i'm like okay. i'm in dude i'm in i'm in right. you got king arthur's probably a james. bond villain and then you got an in like a [ __ ] not a white nephew and it's why but also i'm in dude. and then a tree guy. walks in on a horse. that's also green and i'm like this. now this is my kind of motion. picture right i'm not yet. at this hey hollywood sup. level i'm not there yet. right so the green. giant [ __ ] the green knight. comes in and says whatever. he says this is the gist. of it he says you know. because it's all british. and [ __ ] and it's all it's almost like they're talking like shakespeare and i'm just like i don't even know what they're saying but i happen. to know because i'm just horizontal. in a pod right. at the [ __ ] jet blue [ __ ] and i'm watching the thing so i'm really paying attention there's nothing else going on so uh the green knight guy says to. the [ __ ] def could no no he says to. king arthur one of your men basically i he's i'll can we do a game. you know it's like [ __ ] saw it's like can we play a game and king arthur is like as long as it's fun. and it's not you're not coming. for any ill will and the guy's like no. i want to. i want to. do a game and so he's like okay. and he's like anyone can any one of your guys can strike me. with their sword and the only thing. i ask well however they strike me. i return the favor. in 12 months and it's like just say a year. but i get it back. then you had to. be more descriptive but okay. but i'm like wow what a stupid. [ __ ] game and the guy traveled how long to. come do this and he's a tree so i'm not yet. at sup level i'm not yet. asking hollywood hey hollywood sup. i'm in but where's this. going dude right okay where's it. going so king arthur says does any one of my men want. to partake in this game. and make merry and i'm like okay. and then dev patel. jumps in didn't meet did. you know nobody saw this coming. because he was like he's like a 20. year old or some [ __ ] and all the men were like maybe i'll do it and dev patel's like i'll [ __ ] do it and he comes in and the [ __ ] tree guy just kneels on the [ __ ] ground and dev patel's like you sure you don't want to. fight and the tree guy is like do your worst. and [ __ ] death patel. laps his head off. dude so now i'm like i'm in man. i'm so focused it's like i took ginkgo [ __ ] bloba in this pod okay so i'm watching in the airplane and i'm horizontal watching this. [ __ ] and i'm just you know there's a little bit of turbulence but i'm watching the green night and i'm like oh wow wow this is really [ __ ] interesting and it's so odd and i can't believe i'm not asking a hollywood sup yet boom hello hi how much longer till we get there so now i'm like sup with this [ __ ] but the green knight isn't falling down he's staying on his knees so i'm like intrigued you know and the turbulence lightens up okay all right all right okay and the green knight gets up with no head he stands up like it's a chicken he just stands up like i don't need a head like a chicken when you lap it off and they run around they're just like what head and he picks up his head and the head says meet me in 12. months and he gets on his green. horse and rides away some like hmm. i guess i'm in better. not unravel but i'm in you. wound it so tight i'm in where are we going. so then halfway through the movie dev patel's like guess. i gotta go you know. what i mean he's like santa. arthur should i go do this. game do you think he meant. it and arthur's like i don't know. it's only for you to. find out and i'm just like don't go. your head's gonna get lopped off. he obviously knows magic because he walked around. and picked up his head. and left and went to. his green chapel that. you got to meet him. at and so he's like but it's honorable. to go and dev patel's like [ __ ] yeah i'm gonna go and he goes. dude and the whole movie. is about him going for six days six nights. to try and get to. the green chapel he just meets different. people and [ __ ] he meets somebody. that robs him he meets giants. that are just walking and i'm talking about. uh attack on titan giants. and he's like where are you. going and the giant is. like and just keeps walking. and it's just having these scenes. around like willynilly and at this. point i'm like sup okay and i google. it because i got the wifi. it's free at jetblue and i find out. it was a [ __ ] poem that. was written in the year 1400. or whatever the and i'm like oh dude. you're gonna make a movie that was written. by some jerkoff in the year 1400. and it was just a poem. taking so much liberty i started. reading the poem i didn't know what it. meant it was like and i'm like give me a break. dude and at this point. i'm looking at hollywood. and i'm like sup and everyone's pretending to. like it because dev patel. isn't it he's a hot new. thing and i'm like sup. though man and it got nominated. for like 20 different awards. and i'm like sup though. man not just the bafta. sup no we don't watch. this movie so that's my review of green. [ __ ] night i give it 10 subs i listen. to so many [ __ ] breakdowns of the movie afterwards. man it really made me question. things and i know that people say. well you know a piece of art. a good piece of art. makes you talk about i'm like all right. cool whatever dude but still stop make movies. that just make sense or kind of don't make sense. or if you don't you better. nail it you better david. lynch that [ __ ] dude so we got to. london into. that londoner hotel londoner london. huh checked in and they were just like ah how's it. going we're like cool we liked the hotel. it was nice as [ __ ] and it was pride there. by the way still which i didn't i don't understand. oh there's a [ __ ] time delay or some [ __ ] we were jet lagged and i was like i don't know and uh but so many just proud gays just walking around which is great and uh we get there and he's like so that's a mistake and i'm like great. dude we travel 11. hours i had to. watch the [ __ ] goddamn green knight. and he's just like uh let me try. and fix it could just hang out. at the cafe for a second. i'm like sure you know i [ __ ] love cafe so i guess sat there he came back and said we fixed it. don't worry and that's on us. that we made a mistake. don't worry and so we got to. the room and it was nice and you know. we set up some dinners and [ __ ] let me tell you something about the food. at uh in london now. i [ __ ] on it before in my podcast plenty of times because food in london as a general. rule basically sucks but we went to. some restaurants that were like the topnotch. restaurants and they were [ __ ] absolutely banging dude. like just great just amazing. and then we whenever we would be like oh let's get let's pop. in here and get something. to eat it was like eating. a [ __ ] like i might as well have been eating fabric like i don't understand if you just go to. some restaurant it's like someone. just [ __ ] lowers your jaw and bottoms out inside you just like it's like someone goes can you sit um just and then let me just let me just get there so your nose is right. on the bottom of my anus. and then here lower your here. and i'll just grab your jaw. and open it and then just just in down. your and they ride your face. and they're just like ah there. we go all right cool. that'll be 25 pounds i mean. they just it's like they just [ __ ] down your throat. and you just take it. and you pay for it. like whatever their version of sweet. greens is forget it. just straight down your [ __ ] up you're trying to. get away there whoop up up. keep the nose right at. the back of my anus. and um yeah but the topnotch restaurants. like we went to. cafe mario mario i say because i'm from jersey. was great uh we went to. another place called uh above at hyde which they were like do. you want this five course meal. or the seven q. there's only two things you could order. they were like do you want. the five course meal. or the seven course meal. and i'm like well you're gonna [ __ ] ask this in front of my girl. i mean come on dude. slide me a note okay guys girl. dude i can eat what you say. so i'm going to. take i'm going to. [ __ ] out i'm going to. do the you can ask that's a little disrespect. i mean yeah she's a [ __ ] prada. outfit like how am i going. to five like are you do. you have a nine course meal. i want that one give me the seven. course meals twice i want 14 courses so i say seven and i say it with because i'm like dude. you're not gonna this is says okay. here we go hope you're ready. the [ __ ] that they [ __ ] first of all dude. one thing was like an egg. with yolk in it. i guess and another thing was like a bar. of soap and one thing. was a [ __ ] piece of ice cream. on and on an ice. cube and it was just like and it was good. but also relax you know these [ __ ] restaurants but it's about an experience it's about a culinary experience yeah well make it experience [ __ ] really nice from my mouth. and my wallet how about and i don't need to. be like oh visual. the visual [ __ ] give me the. food you know but it was all about what it. was about it was a beautiful. time and you know we laughed and uh so yeah. we had the seven course meal. at above hide and uh we did. um what else did we do. the [ __ ] god the night it was it's i mean the jet lag [ __ ] is unbelievable like it was like we landed and it was a different time and then we didn't know jet lag i don't know how much of it is actual jet lag just because you were in the air. and those you know because being jet lag. is not about the time. difference it's about being up. in the air and being if you look it. up if you google it. i mean someone will explain. it way better than i can. but um there was that and then also the time. difference so i don't know. how much of it. was the sleep difference or how much. of it was the [ __ ] jet lag yeah. the actual jet lag got. it so hot in here um but uh i finally would like fall asleep. and then like when i would wake up. in the middle at night. it wouldn't be like regular waking up. like what it would be like like that. i would do two and i would look and i would be i was just slept. for sleep for two hours and i'm like should i get up. or not even knowing what time. it is but the worst. part about the [ __ ] thing was like the bathroom. that they had was just it. was one of those bathrooms that. was like way too nice. that it was annoying. like the toilet like the second you walk into. the bathroom the toilet goes [music]. and like sometimes you go to. the bathroom not to. even use the toilet sometimes. you want to. brush your teeth or wash your hands. or just take a break. so that's fine when you walk. in the bottom because you're already awake. [music] but then you can't close the top. without forcing it so you'd leave. it and then you'd go back. in bed and like like two minutes. later it would go and you're like i'm already [ __ ] asleep again. and then it would would like refresh two minutes. even later than that and it was like dude. have a toilet be a toilet that's one of those inventions that's just fine. i don't need an extra. apparatus that comes out and sprays my [ __ ] i understand. that bidets are beautiful but dude. you can keep that [ __ ] i just want. to take dumps and roll. out i just want to. take dumps and roll out transformers more dumps than meets the eye. autobots and decepticons [applause] [music]. more than meets the eye. um yeah so honestly. don't work on any toilets anymore. ever toilet companies until you can create something where you don't have to. get up to go. you can just like poop in the bed. and then it just goes away. do it [ __ ] yeah dude thanks kohler you just go where is it kohler. that's commercial baby i love. you so much as in bed. postcoital oh i love you. too hey where'd it. go kohler hey it's not wet. kohler um we did uh the london. eye which is whatever you don't have to. go do that it's just you know. it's one of those things like in the 80s. or 90s it was. cool but like now it's like there's so many pictures on google. it's like views aren't the thing. to me like views views. are beautiful but like how long you stay. looking at a view three. four seconds and then you could be like all. right i saw it i was here. i did it and then i could go look. at it online if i want to. right so we were at the london. eye which is a circular. ferris wheel that goes way. too slow and i know. that's the point but also make it go. faster i get the idea by four. minutes in and it lasts. 30 minutes dude and she didn't tell me until i got in and they closed the door on the [ __ ] pod and i'm like oh 30 i haven't had coffee yet there's a whole. episode of seinfeld with the commercials. so we did it it. was nice it was romantic. and you know she kept saying where's [ __ ] buckingham palace. and i was like right. there and she was like where there and she was like i don't know. and then all of a sudden halfway. through she's like oh there's buckingham palace. and i was like am i not here oh i'm not here. pinpoint what i said it's beyond. the [ __ ] shitty lake um but it was beautiful. and we had a nice time. and she drank out of a a cup with a straw. and this cup had tits on it so i was that's all good. dude got a picture of it. british people think that's [ __ ] hilarious. i guess i don't know oh the [ __ ] highlight of the trip dude which i forgot i couldn't the highlight of the [ __ ] trip dude this is the highlight of the trip okay kristen is like i got tickets to. see a play and i said which which what play. and she says harry potter. of course she says harry potter. because she's her and she loves harry potter. and she loves every movie that's magical. fantastic beasts seen it harry potter. seen it [ __ ] anything with wizards or people who are shorter than normal or bigger than normal seen it like lord of the rings i'll let you seen it right i think she tried to. like tell me she didn't. see lord of the rings the other day. and i was like i'm not buying. that and um if there's too much. green and brown in a movie. and guys with beards. she's seen it dude. right and um if there's ever a movie where guys like to. live is to. and if that's how the sentence. starts she's seen it right. so she's like i got tickets. to harry potter and i said oh okay. cool we'll go see it because you know. i'll [ __ ] i want to. do that with you and and she says looking at her. phone the day before the play and she's like oh oh huh. why did i buy. four tickets to. harry potter and i say. well i don't know you're dealing. with it why did you buy. four tickets to. harry potter and she says what. and i was like when are you

know me i'm mr. watch it on a home screen. right i'm like oh they oh plays. but are we in the 1600s. do you know what i mean. are we in 1910. like we got small boxes. in our team you get up. close and personal with these [ __ ] you see closeups i watch the movie ambulance. they got closeups where you. only see the dude's nose. and eyes like we can see what. the dude is feeling so why. would i go see a play dude. right it's 2022. so you're gonna make me sit through. two parts in a day. like and dude so she's like well the first one is at two. and the second one. is at seven and i'm like oh how [ __ ] long is it. she's like five hours but we can't. see the first one because we gotta go. do the [ __ ] of the london i already booked it and i said she said do you just wanna see the second half. and i was like we're not gonna know. what's going on and then i'm like oh yeah. it doesn't matter because jk rowling has. just made this [ __ ] up anyway so i'm like whatever and she's like but you know i also got tickets. to see to. kill a mockingbird and i'm like jesus. christ these two plays. are like the most pleased play shits. that you could possibly. see and we're gonna see british. versions of this [ __ ] it takes place down south and she's like would you rather see to. kill a mockingbird or just part. two of harry potter. and i'm like for [ __ ] sake dude. i'd rather see harry potter. but not the second part. so i guess we're gonna have to. see to kill a mockingbird and i'm gonna have to. put on my game face. and pretend like i like plays. [ __ ] it maybe it'll be better. than i went in with you know what i went in with an open mind. so i remember when i said you know. i tried to read. the book when i was a kid. in high school and it was just you know. that's just like why are you. trying to make high schoolers. read that [ __ ] book and then we tried to. watch a movie and i'm like it's in black and white and i'm like i'm not it's just not for me. i've seen the rock right. so i sit down and the theater's beautiful. i mean it's really small and intimate. and nice and we got great. seats she got great seats. so she canceled the harry potter. seats and we got great. deeds of this to. kill a mockingbird play and i'm like all. right you know what they're impressing. me with the [ __ ] niceness of the theater and the theater was probably built in the year four so and it's still up kept right like there's so much gold and it's got a big wooden set. in the front like right. in the front there's like this. big wooden wall. and kristen's like is that there. usually or do you think and i'm like it's not. there usually it's [ __ ] the set it's gonna rise uh all right. and then we're gonna see the other the more set that they have. and the play did the thing. that this is the most like [ __ ] pretentious [ __ ] that a play does is right. away right this is so this is how you know you're in for a [ __ ] banger of a play that no bones about it just pretend city play when a guy walks out before the wall rises and and and like grabs a guitar and like starts playing and i'm like oh just start when's it start when the guy walks out or or after the guy is this part of it or what start it when it starts right is this going to. be one of those plays. where guys in the audience. come from the back. with lanterns and they're like we're looking for him. and you're like he's over there. be beyond us why are you with us. did you pay 150 for a goddamn. ticket go up there dude. that's where you rehearse go. near the guy with the [ __ ] guitar that just literally sits there for five hours. and plays the guitar. sometimes for background music. i'm like talk about it. [ __ ] what'd you get paid 40. pounds and so the play starts. and i find myself judging. you know i'm in the biz. right okay cool i get it. i'm gonna i'll go acting in my corner. you know i mean right. but i'm judging but i don't want to. judge i catch myself judging. right away and i'm like all right. you know what dude. stop just relax you're in a [ __ ] building. that was built in the year. 11. right just chill this. is beautiful it's ornate as [ __ ] these actors this is their job. they've rehearsed for the [ __ ] and it's written. by aaron sorkin so i'm like all right. we know his [ __ ] he did. like the morning show. or newsroom or whatever. the [ __ ] and i'm like all right i'll sit down and i'll watch this [ __ ] and i just i s i remember i walked in with an open mind so i had to. catch myself okay open minded up let's keep your mind. open to [ __ ] so i'm watching the thing. and it's about this dude. atticus finch that like is a lawyer. and he wants to. like help this you know. the whole thing's about race. i don't know how much you know. about to kill. a mockingbird but i guess you should or whatever. people consider it you're cultured if you know what to. kill a mockingbird is and uh it's about a black dude. that gets on trial for raping. this nine this. nineteenyearold uh woman in in in in this. play and um the uh dad. did it the the the ins. the dad did it of the woman. and he's trying to. blame this black dude. for it and it took takes place. in like 19 whatever. it is 50 40s 20. i have no [ __ ] idea but the clothes looked 40ish 1940ish. 50ish 1950ish i don't know uh or whatever it was after the slaves. whatever the [ __ ] i don't know i don't know history dude and um don't come here. for history you come here for the hardhitting facts. of today and so i'm like sitting watching this. thing and it's all about race. and the racial tension. in the thing and i'm like oh okay. i i get why they rewrote this. for i get it i get why. david not david mamet uh aaron sorkin wanted i get you. know and i catch myself thinking oh i yeah. okay uh it is yes i i know. what you're doing you're hitting me. over the head with it but okay. i acquiesce yes it. is also still relevant today. this okay you got me. dude you got me. right i started judging but now with an open mind. i'm sitting here okay i've got great. seats i'm enveloped all right. i succumb hey guys i give up. yes it's unfortunate but it's still relevant. today okay you win now that's 35. or 45 or seven. hours i have no idea about. time in this play i succumb to. it all right and atticus just wants to. do good right. he wants to. respect people above all he wants to. respect people no matter what their race. he even wants to. respect the dad who did this. [ __ ] because he doesn't want to. judge anyone because he can't. what he says crawl around. inside of their skin now. we've all been guilty of that. judging people and it's what i was doing when i sat. down in this theater that was built in the year. 14. and his kids are mad. at him atticus's kids scout. and finch are mad at him. because he's not fighting he's not physically. fighting he's not yelling. why respect these [ __ ] if they're racist. why respect these people if they want. us dead and we do the intermission now. there are parts of the play. where i'm getting emotional. but i'm keeping it as at bay. right the intermission happens of course kristen. has to go to. the bathroom because she's a woman and their bladders are the size. of a dime and she comes. back with ice cream some [ __ ] how they weren't even serving it and it starts. again the second half. of the play and i'm watching the play. and this play is now in the trial. of it right in the thick. of it the second act and the whole play. a lot of it takes. place in the courtroom right. and the jury is in the back. of the room like the back like the furthest. point from us we're watching and i'm as somebody. who's done plays ntv and as acting in his corner. right i'm wondering why the director decided to. put the jury in the back. furthest part of the room. because that means that the lawyers. will be talking to. the jury and we will be looking. at their backs most of the time. when they're talking to. the jury and i found that i thought. interesting and i thought i judged it. wrong i thought that's wrong. why would they do that. why wouldn't they make us. a part of the jury. we would seem like we should be more. involved in this scene and all these scenes. and in this play i think it. would be better that's me. judging and there's a part. where atticus finch needs. to give his closing. arguments and he was up. all night writing his closing. arguments and in the beginning of the play. there's a scene where atticus says to. his client what they're going. to ask you why you went. in to help this 19. year old white girl with her. chores what are you going. to say and the accused says well i went in because i felt sorry. for her and atticus finch says never say. that that is the worst thing. you could possibly say. say she looked like she needed. a hand so later. on in the courtroom scene. and one of them when the prosecutor is grilling. this man the accused and he says why would you go. in and have and help. a 19 year old white. girl with her chores when she has seven. brothers and sisters and he says i wanted. to help her uh i wanted to. give her she looked like she needed. a hand just what atticus said and he says oh come on. why would you do this. and he keeps grilling. him he says i wanted. to give her a hand she looked like she needed. a hand and he keeps asking and atticus fitch is. like objection he's asked five. times now and then the prosecutor says why would you do this. and then the accused says because i felt sorry. for her and boom just like that. as an audience we know they lost. the case right we know. oh [ __ ] why is that bad we may or may. not know but we know that. he was instructed not to. do it and he did it. and now it looked like they were winning. the case but all bets. are off so atticus finch before his closing. arguments decide to. rewrite his closing arguments he was up. all night you know. scout finch's daughter tells us there's the audience. you know hey he was up. all night and he couldn't figure it out. and right before he gives his closing. arguments he's looking at his paper. and he [ __ ] rips it up so now i'm like sup. right but in a different way. not in the same way. as i saw the green. knight and i was like this. trite hollywood piece of [ __ ] sucks. so sup what you do. in hollywood i'm like in britain. watching this play and i came in with kind of an open. mind that started closing. again and then checked myself. and opened it a little bit more. and now i'm like oh he ripped. up the paper that he rewrote all. night last night because he wants. to get this accused not guilty because that's truly the truth. and so now i'm like well sup. and i'm involved and so he rips up. the paper and he talks. to the jury and he's talking to. the jury and his whole thing. is he's saying like you know. what yadda yadda you know. about uh i was gonna say this. and i was gonna say that. and the truth is times are. changing and this we can start. to change if you make him. not guilty because we know he didn't do. this and we know who did. and he starts going on about how the world needs. to change okay and he's yelling. at this jury and this is like the first time. atticus finch you really see him. kind of like yelling because he's a calm person the character. and he's yelling at the uh at the uh jury. and his back is to. us and i'm still thinking what the [ __ ] and he starts. talking about how the world is this. certain way and he starts. walking around and now he walks all. the way around to. the front of the stage and he's still looking. at the jury so he's very close to. us and he turns around. to us as he's talking. and he says now i'm already. the emotions are right behind the face. right and he says to. as he turns around the first. thing he says is we can't keep living. like this if we keep living like this. and tearing each other apart. we won't be able to. survive and i'm like this is i i literally sink in my seat. because i think oh [ __ ] i'm not just gonna let tears. out i'm actually going to. whimper because i'm like he's talking to. us but also he's talking to. me and i'm like is this. even the actor or is this. the character or is this the is this. just the guy this. could be me saying this. dude and when i tell you i whimpered because i had to. keep i go like i'm not [ __ ] with you i go like like the biggest [ __ ] in london just and he starts saying when the mob comes after you and you're and and it's unjust and i'm [music]. i'm a squeaky door in london. dude and then he turns. back around and starts talking about and i'm like oh thank god. thank god dude i was gonna cry. so uh i was gonna have to. grab onto the stranger next to. me and just be like is it. okay and he starts talking. to the jury and now he's at the jury. and he turns back to. us from the back and he's saying to. us you know i told him. not to say he felt sorry. for her i told him. to say he wanted to. help her because uh she looked like she could use the help. and in that moment you talk. about breaking and the prosecutor was trying. to break him and trying. to make him forget who he was he says that's what i thought. that he was going. to forget who he was but he didn't forget. who he was hey and i was like oh word. and the tears just went [ __ ] [music].
