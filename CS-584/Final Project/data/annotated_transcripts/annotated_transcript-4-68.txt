my my legs and then i put them on my legs and then they [ __ ] zap them and i don't know if it helps but whatever i tell you what i put it on my story and people so many people are like does this work i don't even know what you mean does it work what does it mean when people that's one of the things i really got to. get behind his massages and like muscle. work and [ __ ] everybody's telling me it's a very la thing i don't know if it's around everywhere but people like you got to. make sure or the recovery. you massage the [ __ ] out and how do you there's no there's no like what do you call. it central what do you call. that [ __ ] thing there's no central. how do you you can't. compare it to. something else do you know. i'm saying like if you're so i guess. if you work out both legs. at the same time then they get equally. a sore and then your only. muscle work you [ __ ]. massage one leg then the next day. you see if that leg. feels better than the other leg. right that's the control that's what i'm looking. at that's the control the control. jesus christ dude got a dna. job right yes does it matter. it doesn't matter at [ __ ] all what you get in algebra unless you're gonna be an algebra trician. dude one time one time i was i was doing algebra. in my in my [ __ ] high school. class and and i was like and my mom. was like you really gotta work. harder on algebra it's hard. i just never made any sense. i had a [ __ ] teacher named mrs weaver and i was getting addy and we have to. make it we have to. make it i have i had to. do better and i was trying. to do better trying. to do better and then all of a sudden. they introduced imaginary numbers and i [ __ ] straightup said in my head go [ __ ] yourself dude imaginary numbers know all the shit's imaginary you got eight apples and then eight apples walk in the door and guess what there's no [ __ ] apples though did you know that you're making it all up these are all problems you're making up ok you want to. know the most [ __ ] asian thing you can do if you're an american. asian is this playing with your pen. and doing tricks with your pen. like that everyone in la. cañada all the american asians. would do this [ __ ] and they'd [ __ ] catch it and i [ __ ] learned how to. do that in algebra and i can [ __ ] still do it. and i'm not even [ __ ] 40 i know. but when i get older dude. i'm gonna [ __ ] always be like twirling it like this oh wow such a [ __ ] anyway dude imaginary numbers bro. no no i wish that's the thing. i wish i was me now. back then and i know people like to. think like i know how people everyone knows. it i wish i knew back then what i know. now dude i don't even care. about knowing the [ __ ] i wish i was more out spoken. because i was that dude. back then i had all the opinions but i just [ __ ] didn't really revel in it i needed to. i need to be in algebra. now as a 17 year old and i need mrs. weaver to be saying oh so these are introducing imaginary numbers and then i go like this no they're all imaginary. you making up all these problems by. none of this [ __ ] exists dude and if you listen to. this and you're 17 first of all. turn it off cuz imma badham cuz mmm bad influence. but also now algebra [ __ ] sucks dude and i'm almost 40 and i'm telling you that now you know how they're like well when you get older you know you don't do it and i'm not a bad influence dude [ __ ] this man i'm telling you right now you high school. kids get out of that. algebra class due to. high school is you got to. do it because they gotta figure out. how to make it. so kids don't [ __ ] stab each other. and do heroin you understand. that's what high school. is so all the kids. just kind of chill out. hang out learn how to. be with each other that's why. i call it college is too. early everyone should go to. college when they're 26 27 28. that's when you because that's the thing it's everyone's you're not done. develop i'll tell you what i was immature. kid until i was 33. or 34 i was a late bloomer. for real i went through. puberty a little bit late. and i was not an adult. until i was 34 35 i did immature [ __ ] was selfish. as [ __ ] that's the thing dude 18 you want me to. go to college at 18. that's why when everyone goes. to 18 it goes to. college at 18 they go. absolutely bonkers men all of. a sudden the dorky. kid is the cool kid. you ever had you know that. [ __ ] it's like a a [ __ ] you come back for this spring for the summer. break or spring break. and they're like hey we're all going. to [ __ ] roberts house robert robert who robert dallman what yeah the [ __ ] kid was a dork bro he runs pepperdine what are you kidding me are you kidding are you kidding me bro i went to visit him in mizzou haha that guy who runs it dude he's practically chris brown at mizzou what he wear the [ __ ] trench coat bro he doesn't wear that anymore he's got green hair that's not cool where do you see him bro it's pretty poppin and then he shows up with like [ __ ] some chick named hailey and you're like oh she's from [ __ ] st. francis she's from the other school god this guy's poppin and now everybody wants to be friends with [ __ ] rob that's because we all go to college too or too early rob didn't even figure out what the [ __ ] he was til he went to mizzou and now it's on and poppin in the mother time that yeah can people change i hated that [ __ ] i was who i was in high school bro and now i am who i am and that shit's not change in dude it's funny dude how that happens though we all go we we go away and then we become who we become that's dude i tell a man i have bothered me man when i was a kid like people will go study abroad and they'd come back and [ __ ] and they'd be like yeah [ __ ] girls would be like lost my virginity and dudes would be like took a backpack walked around a little bit read a book no i know how nine know how it goes check in with me we're all lost we're all [ __ ] lost man we go to college too early that's why now there's people with like [ __ ] you know you see that guy walking a bird with flying that guy it's cuz he went to college too early you said that guy thing on twitter he was running down the street with two parrots on a leash and the parrots were flying and he was running with those parrots that guy should get all the [ __ ] and i'm not joking girls that guy deserves all of it for real don't even know what he looks like but he's gangster if i were like that if i was a guy i got a walk birds man i gotta walk birds do you know i didn't know you could walk birds you know what i'm. talking about right you guys. have seen this [ __ ] the birds. are flying the guys are running. okay i didn't know you could walk birds. bro i never even thought of that. this guy is living in 2050 the birds. are level two birds. are they [ __ ] how come we don't talk about how cool birds are. men but unless you're bryan. callen we got to. all start get we gotta stuff. that's what that's the thing. about high school is that the classes. are all the classes because they need to. figure out the basic. they need to. all conform to. all of the certain types. of people i didn't like that. [ __ ] because i'm not doing the [ __ ] that everyone does cuz i you know why don't wanna don't wan okay so that's why if i was remember electives and [ __ ] you'd be like well i'd like to. get into a home. eric i'd like to. even those were [ __ ] i'm talking about dude when i was soon as you get out eighth grade. i should have been able. to sign up for [ __ ] bird walk in class and and and there should have been a standup. comedy class or whatever the [ __ ] and not even a class. a stupid class to. have but like some kids want. to be a magician. i want to. be a magician so now. what oh well there's no magician. class okay so at least let's just have the teacher's. guide the people and try to. learn some magic to. teach to the kids. that's why i like david blaine. he doesn't even really do. mine he does magic but also hope. you like i'll just stand. in a spot for seven weeks. and you're like oh well that's not magic. music but i'm testing my body. you're like kay i agree you. test in your body i can. just break out of these handcuffs. really yeah wow that's amazing. it takes eight weeks oh so you just keep on. trying to break them. in and finally this is wear and tear. and then open yeah okay is it. magic i'm testing my body okay. but he can do card. tricks to my babies. so saw him do our card. tricks to al pacino. and that's a real story i live in a fantasy. i saw david blaine do a [ __ ] card trick to. al pacino and guy fieri was there and so fester stallone. was filming it i live in a fantasy. and then and then and then and then did david blaine. say to al pacino. pick a suit and then did al pacino. say well i was in armani the other day. ah i live in a fantasy. now pacino turned to. me and he said remember that. card i live in a fantasy. al pacino turned over to. me and said there's my card. remember it and then i said well i will net. i will actually never forget. any of this in my life. okay was the seven. of diamonds so anyway that's crazy. so mmhmm well you know the high school. should be more specific that's why it's specific you gotta get specific high schools. man there should be clumps of high schools. that are like for certain things. like the entertainment high schools. that they have sometimes they have like some of them. in texas or some [ __ ] dance high schools. they got those weird ones. i used to. think those were [ __ ] weird but they're probably right what if you know you love animals and you want to. go to a [ __ ] sanctuary high. school like an animal sanctuary. high school and just chill. with [ __ ] zebras and gophers loved the dude. that would i hated that. when i was in when i was in elementary school. and the guy would come with all. the animals oh everyone loved it. well it's animal day we get to. come out the guy. comes with animals and if you like got class. this is a gopher and steven de filippis would be. like uhoh and there'd be some kid. [ __ ] with a closed throat. because a gopher came out. like sorry matthews [ __ ] allergic he's got to. go home now in the 80s. nobody gave a [ __ ] now come bring animals. i wonder if they still do that. they probably don't they used. to bring [ __ ] snakes out dude. hey they could kill us. like why not just bring a wild. boar oh yeah it's snake. up theirs is up. the snake swallowed tommy we didn't like. him anyway dude why not just bring a wild. boar bring a hyena they should just bring a [ __ ] imagine them bringing just a starving hyena hey class gather around it's just like this hyena oh whoa it's thrashing oh whoa whoa okay it has danny vic's arm whoa it's thrashing danny vic's arm hey da swallow man die. hit i swallowed my arm. um anyway my [ __ ] one time i was at a strip club when i was 21. dude and my friend was there. and he was 20. and he went up to. the [ __ ] brawl i know. i don't go up to. the stage i chill. back like a mob boss when i go. to the strip club haven't. been in a long time. but when i go i sit back. like a mob boss man. you think i don't cross my legs. at the strip club oh bro. you're crazy man i cross one leg. over my [ __ ] onto my [ __ ] leg i'm real british. at the strip club dude. but i'm also an italian. mobster dude and i lay back. and i sip a [ __ ] club soda or nothing dude. i gotta feel good in my environment one. of the reasons why i don't smoke. is cuz i didn't need to. [ __ ] i don't want to. have to do [ __ ] i don't when i take a break i want you to. know i'm taking a break i don't want. oh he's got to. go do something no no no. no dude i straightup gotta get away. if i'm at a party which i never am if i'm at a party. and some shits going on and i gotta take a break. i go outside and i wait. do it i feel it in my body. i used to. be uncomfortable taking a break i didn't have a cigarette. i wasn't checking my cell phone they weren't around. cellphones rolling around and now. cell phones are around. sometimes i took my cell phone but you best. believe i could just take a break. sit outside and wait with my hands. in my pockets people like what's he doing. just staring at the sky man. that's a break i'm not. fidgety dude i'm not fidgety i learned. that from my dad he just chills and that's the thing. i so i would go to. the strip club and sit back like a mob boss. dude and then in the end. on the on the on the stage. some people would go walk up. to this stage and sit at the stage. and one time my friend. he was 20 i was 21. he was 20 he walked up. to this stage and he put his feet. which is like his face. was all up in it. and the girl was dancing it. around like that and she was like squeezing. her boobs and stuff said juvenile. and by the way what word do you use. for tits to not sound like a [ __ ] creep for real tits boobs i'm 39. tit if i say yeah. her tits were good i seem like a creep. if i say yeah her boobs what am i 12. what do you say jugs. you sunk a [ __ ] [ __ ] you're not i mean breasts then you sound like what are you doing you're trying not to. sound like a creep. which makes it creepier so what the [ __ ] is it. come up with some [ __ ] tatas. then you're just an [ __ ] you know what i mean. like cringe i'm gonna say.
