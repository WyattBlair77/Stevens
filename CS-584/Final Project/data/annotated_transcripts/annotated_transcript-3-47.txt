machine i am getting poked in the butt. by a [ __ ] a really really large [ __ ] object well so uh i don't know dude you know i drove here and it's all good and my nose feels good and i feel [ __ ] excited about that now when you said you drove here yeah obviously you drove here you drive everywhere you drive here every time why'd you why'd you even say it why'd you even say i just i just you know it was like dead space but instead i said i drove here okay well how have you been how's your week going it's going well man my nose is good and i [ __ ] slept i didn't sleep well last night dude i kept waking up every [ __ ] hour and a half. i got this new cbd [ __ ] though. i'm gonna try no thc so many [ __ ] letters the last 10. double acp seven days the last 10. 12 days i haven't slept. at all last night i finally. got some sleep and it's because one up to. me i took some [ __ ] thc slash. c so many letters got it. from the n double h. and it gave me and then s p. c c and then i played my ps5 and um come from the p. a c slash one. zero sec all right dude. uh enough of it so look uh you did. do cbd uh i do it. all but i did do it. did you rub it in your face. or what do you do. you could think of the crazy. stuff yeah oh yes it does. dude dude you can do cbd. in anyway it's crazy. like they're like would you like a tincture. or would you like to. take it in pill. form or would you like to. put it up your anus. or would you like to. rub it we have face. lotion they'll be like we have a cbd shirt. if you'd like to. wear it you'll be very calm all day. i do the cbd with the weed. because i want to. get high but i also the cbd really. helps me sleep oh oh problems. no it's all good it's all. good it's all good. but what the [ __ ] oh drug addict got too. close to me yeah. you almost lost your fingers. no yep so uh well let's get into. it dude all right. hi you know what i keep thinking. about is the guy who died. in the middle yeah you love the guy. oh my god dude last episode. when the guy died in the middle. of his thing and came back. to life oh what this. guy dude what is this. hold on is this a couple. in a tv show what the [ __ ] why because it's a mixed. race because it's white a white. and a black guy you walk around. you don't see mixed. couples they're but then you turn on [ __ ] true. oh you walk around. you don't see mixed. couples dudes exist. they [ __ ] should be a plenty right because it's la and we're a melting pot but you go to. fort wayne indiana it's only whites. together and then some blacks together. dude if you walk around. l.a there's not enough mixture will you turn on. the tv dude if you [ __ ] turn on the tv. and it goes to. a commercial break oh my god six commercials. you think that it wasn't allowed. to keep race. pure okay okay i know i know okay. okay you're saying things that are not. good the race pure this. is nice to. see i don't think i just i i know everyone pretty soon. is going to be tan. and it's fine not pretty. soon we're talking like 300 million. years you know what i mean. that's i don't think so i think it. could be probably 50 to. 60 years so everybody living now. is by the time they're dead. they're all going to. be the same color no. my point is am i watching peacock. the thing the thing about mixed. race couples is that they really. do exist i know the reason. they're in this is the thing. i i don't like though. people get all up in arms about like oh that's not. really how reality is what. commercial is basing itself. in [ __ ] reality dude they're trying to. sell products to. as many [ __ ] people as possible. yeah but no dude. they do base themselves. in reality dude they do they'll be in a kitchen. and like the dad will be like uh oh and then a mom will. come in and she'll be like that's already. unrealistic kleenex that's already unrelated. you're supposed to. believe that some [ __ ] family in just fort wayne indiana like an asian guy. is going to be dating. a black chick it it just find me. one in fort wayne. indiana why are you basically. why it's tough to. be in fort wayne. indiana not every commercial takes place that's that's what we did. buy untied dude i buy tide not in fort. wayne indiana have you ever. dated a black check yeah. yeah what's the percentage of what. of black girls versus the interracial. girls never done the math. on it and guess what if i did. it would be very [ __ ] strange that. would be very [ __ ] you know i actually know this because i yeah all right. cool so let's turn on. anyway turn up turn on peacock. dude hit up cbs is. on commercial hey chris hey matt. roger justin and brandy. bill were here uh first of all love your podcast. we appreciate it uh baby. since day one hell yeah. cold all that so we got some uh baby. that we need from you. guys so they got baby. socks right there we watch shows on streaming services netflix. stuff like that and she has a problem with me watching shows. without her and from my point. of view she either falls asleep. watching them or just never has. time so i'm sitting here on my day. to day like not doing anything. so i just go ahead. and watch them unless she specifically says that hey i want. to watch this particular show. with you yeah so i i i don't watch that. one which there's only one that she said that. but other than that everything's free. game including lifeline including congratulations she's not having it is that what she's looking for she's like yeah you're wrong no all right. appreciate it love y'all. i think you i think more publicly should be interracial. you experience this um so why don't you take it. first oh yeah dude but i have a simple. solution but you go first. now you go first i think that didn't even. really work you took it you said you go. first i said you go first. you were already taking a breath. to speak with the quickness so you weren't. even really being polite. even though it was under the guise of being polite. and that's who my brother. is no no no no so the deal. is has this guy ever heard of a cell. phone well he could just text. her first and say hey honey i want to. watch this show is it going. to bother you if i do that so he's so he's talking about starting. a new show no he's talking. about in the middle of a you start. a show together we don't know we don't know it. seemed like you said you start. a show together and then in the middle. he wants to. watch some episodes and she's like well you can't watch it. without me that seems like what's been happening. am i wrong here am i. what you always do on the show. is you assume things people said and then answer that. as if they said the thing. that you said instead of the thing. that they actually said is that. a listening problem or is that just a regular problem. well that i have with you. this is an entertainment. podcast so i guess in a way i'd say you're welcome. oh okay we'd bypass all. that and i'd let you know. you're welcome dude nice way. to spin that around anyway. go ahead and give your advice. what he said yeah they start. watching stuff and she'll fall asleep. yep yeah and then he wants to. keep watching right now she gets mad. that gotcha right you know. what i mean so i was right. [ __ ] cool okay dude that was [ __ ] the police oh those yeah they were they were wondering you got to. hold them so fast. the [ __ ] truth police called me i know it's crazy so um but when somebody put the gun on us and you tried calling 911. and they put you on hold forever. i don't remember calling 911. yeah we were in the car. remember i was going. right i remember it happened. on the freeway don't talk. over me when i say that. was going reverse on. the freeway remember that and you were trying. to call 911 and all i kept thinking is if this [ __ ] shoots and and hits my brother my life's. over i'm probably going to. kill myself shoots and hits. my brother you can just say. with the bullet yeah dude. he it was very weird. before we get into. this dude from a very beautiful. mixedrace couple and i think there should be more mixedrace couples right. okay um [music] and i'm from a mixed. race uh thing because i'm italian. and she comes from like french. european descent or some [ __ ] and uh what do you mean mom we're talking about mom me you don't come from mixed races i'm saying from a mixed race. i have a big source relationship. you're in a mixed race. yeah because kristen is i'm italian. and i know christian is not italian. i don't want that but from north. carolina so um so so this so what was i saying. oh yeah yeah the guy pulled. a gun yeah because you sped up. he cut you off for something. you spit up and you go. yeah yeah you did one. of those two you're doing going. up yeah i don't like the bitchass. ones when they do that. yeah they do this. like just this is not strong. yeah like this is strong. dude a whopping yeah [music]. gross actually okay and um and so so the guy sped up. and pulled a gun out and started waving it. around he did and i said i just slowed down. and he slowed down. right to stop us yeah he stopped right. in front of us. on the [ __ ] because i was unwilling. to go around him. because bullets yeah. yeah and so he so i was like oh just reverse. and i was very caught dude. i you were calm right. i was my blood pressure i drop it. dude because i was already thinking about the potential. guilt of a bullet hitting you i get it. but i don't flash forward. i stay in the moment. okay and i look and i assess you know. because you can't assess if you're like oh if you're thinking. about my brother might end. up dead it's true. i don't do that dude. i was not in good. ass there's a scene. in one of the pierce. brosnan james bond movies. where he's just on a gurney. and he has to. act like he his pulse. stops and so he puts himself. into a coma and so they're like he's dead. get him out of here. and then he gets out and they [ __ ] put him in a body bag. and that's how he escapes because they thought he died. because he put his pulse into. a coma the worst writing of all. time well bro making [ __ ] up you know how can he get out of this one how about he stops his own. pulse i don't remember who i was watching this. with but whoever was watching this. with they said like you know. you can actually oh oh it's probably uncle mike. i was gonna say that. dude it probably was dude. and so um so anyway i was like oh you can and so that was probably. what i was trying. to do when the guy pulled. the gun on us you were imagine that. happened and i was just like calm down. calm down and i did and then like it just shoots. me while i'm in a coma. but do you remember how badass. the thing that i ultimately did was he stopped i stopped cars. whizzing by wasn't buying those and bites in the middle of the day. on a tuesday we had just voted remember that. we voted for obama thank you. very much i don't remember that. and uh i remember he was reversing with his gun. waving it around and i just went. and i floored it and went around. his ass 060 in [ __ ] no time and then he was on my ass he was on our ass and then i pretended to. stay on the 134 at the very last second. right before the divider to. the five so he had to. stand on 134. okay well liam neeson okay. well my pulse was more. like the amnesia but your pulse was. but i was so in the world. more likely i'm decent so. yeah okay all right. i don't i don't know what my brother. dies i was i was i had nightmares about that. [ __ ] i know you're really really affected and killed yeah yeah it was [ __ ] up all right so look i was i think look what don't like he has you're not always together in a relationship. so that means that if she falls asleep. and then the next day. you go somewhere to. work or whatever the [ __ ] you do hey girl catch up you fell asleep catch up to. where he is and then that. night you got a [ __ ] show to. watch again yeah but she wants to. watch it with him i guess i know but but so so so he's got to. be what watching the show. and then making sure when she sleeps you can't. do that you watch a boardwalk empire. you're invested dude what if you're invested what are you. going to do next put on the show. she doesn't want to. see but you don't know when she sleeps is what. i'm saying you're invested with what. [ __ ] lucky johnson or whatever his name is is doing okay not knocking johnson and then [ __ ] and then what knock if your buck is doing and then you're watching and then she falls asleep but you're invested dude you're watching ozarks and you're like is he going to. make it out of that. ozarks who are you [ __ ] grandma. carmella just adding an s you're watching. [ __ ] you know jim. you're watching [ __ ] warwick empires breaking bads. boy meets worlds you're watching. wonder uses the wonder users and uh and so you're watching it. and then [ __ ] you're watching you're you're you're hell bent. you're in the middle of [ __ ] season three of lucifer's. and then [ __ ] chief you don't know when she falls asleep. on that but because you don't know. yeah okay so the thing. is though we want to. make sure they have a happy. existence together right yeah so maybe he could look over. sometimes if this is common. right maybe he could learn. about some other [ __ ] shows yeah he's making shows she doesn't care about and he can watch those [ __ ] shows when she [ __ ] falls asleep then he's making her issue which is falling asleep too soon. not just falling asleep. she's also at work and he wants to. watch well no but okay. okay so right if there's actual things that she needs. to be doing then i think that he should wait for her. yes if it's just crazy kristin. my my because i'm in a interracial. i'm an interracial and she's so she's from white. i know you're white i know. i have an italian descent. right and she is like i think french or something. both white whatever it is. but she so calvin is mixed. race right so but like he sure. looks like it so so i identify. with this couple as what i'm saying. yeah i think a lot. of people do no but because we're both interracial. right so oh okay okay so busted a nut. so oh oh okay so what. i think is kristen now this. is a deeper but christian. will be like let's i'll be like let's watch a new show. i should be like great. dude i turn on [ __ ] nookie. johnson or something thompson whatever. it is dude right. i know it was based on a real person. okay yeah i'm smart. okay and so i s i so i'm watching the [ __ ] board boardwalk empire right. and i'm looking at it. and we're watching an episode the episode. ends it's [ __ ] gangbusters right. i love boardwalk empire okay. i'm one of those guys. that's like why isn't it. [ __ ] considered in with the sopranos. with breaking bad hey grace first time. we've ever agreed about a show. yeah why is it not in with the [ __ ] breaking bad. sopranos [ __ ] ozark it's legendary. uh uh boy meets why. is it not [ __ ] mad man. there we go i didn't like that. but you know what i mean. people do mad men is boring. as [ __ ] it's fine. okay going on a tangent. keep going right but it is boring. as [ __ ] and everyone just liked that show. because of the [ __ ] haircuts and the [ __ ] style that it no and why did i like it not for those reasons did you ever did you ever. consider that yes i did okay. what did you think secretly you do. like it pisses me. off that you're gonna speak for me. and what i [ __ ] you're thinking you're [ __ ] wrong but keep going that girl was a good actress in that that came out and now she's in handmaid's tale. and she's a [ __ ] good actress but she's a scientologist so like let's leave it alone. talking about the thing you were talking. about though but so what were we talking about. the mixed race you and kristen. so kristen is like we're watching it. and then i say let's watch another episode. and she says what and i say let's watch the second. episode and she's like oh okay. we watch the second episode. yeah and i look and at the corner. of my eye i see the [ __ ] she's watching tick tock a little bit no that's not good fine. watch tick tock a little bit. but you're here with me. we're watching nookie johnson okay. okay thompson second one. ends and i say dude. i was involved in this. show at the end of the first episode. yeah the second now you're waiting. i'm away yeah let's watch a third. episode and she says i don't know. she's not gonna do it. she's not i think maybe i'm gonna go. to bed okay so she goes to. bed yeah but guess what dude. what she's not going to. bed she's in bed. uhhuh she's in bed. but her face is glowing what's that. mean she's a poet but she's not. yeah do i describe [ __ ] differently. where are you are you. also in bed i'm watching episode. three of [ __ ] lucky johnson so i'm waiting for a problem so the problem is the next morning. we wake up and she says that. show's good and i say. [ __ ] yeah night falls and i say let's watch episode four and she says well you're already past. one and i say all right. well let's watch episode three again. then i guess and she says nah. and now i'm involved. in a show and i gotta watch it. alone dude okay and i'm pissed. because we were supposed to. have this [ __ ] juncture together but it's okay to. watch stuff but alone. the next night she comes. down and she's like let's watch something. else and i'm like you just want. to watch [ __ ] three episodes. of some [ __ ] die. okay we finally got to. a problem obviously maybe it's something. that actual interracial couples experience more. because you're saying if it's if you guys. are any indication being a mixed. race couple okay um i think that texture. before when you're alone. texting and be like hey i wanted. to watch this show i know you're at work. is that cool like did. you want to. watch it if you do i'll wait for you. that's easy just do that. but that's fine but then he doesn't know. when she's falling asleep. she falls asleep and he's still watching. the show and then he's got to. rewatch it no when he wakes up and he goes. to work and she goes to. work if she comes back. earlier you catch up. dude but how about this look over. sometimes you're invested in what. the [ __ ] is going on when you're watching fear thy neighbor or whatever the [ __ ] show you're watching dad invested look over once every 20 minutes dude look over i'm probably not all right next one hey chris and matt i need we have a lot of ginger fans really don't want to. end up on fear thy. neighbor and i feel like i might luckily i don't live in atlanta so maybe i'm safe i don't know maybe um husband and i have lived in the house. that we're in for eight. months uh one of our neighbors. never seen her never talk. to her don't know what she looks like so. um one morning it's like 6. 30 a.m and both my kids are asleep husband and i are asleep there's this crazy. loud banging on our door. and i look at the ring camera. no idea who this. woman is she's just got one. single crutch and she's like swaying. outside super weird um at 6. 30 and so my husband goes to. the door asks her what she needs. and she tells us that we are sabotaging. her sleep schedule because we are. timing our car alarms. to go off every morning. at the same time that's not true. does it well don't set. off our car alarms. she's clearly crazy yeah whoa what do i do. i love how it ended what do. i do um what do you do. what you do is say. this okay i got it. okay say this say if she comes over. again and accuses you of that. say you're on my property if you come. over here and accuse me. of something that i'm that. i've not done ever again. i'll [ __ ] kill you no that's you can't threaten i mean she's a candidate. you're on your property and you don't want. it yeah if somebody's being crazy. on your property it's kind of scary. you have selfdefense just be like i'm warning. you if you do this again. you come out here accusing. me of [ __ ] that i obviously don't do i'll [ __ ] kill you and go to. bed sleep like a baby. that's bad okay maybe not kill. you break your up. she rolls up with her. [ __ ] crutch and she says hey you're setting your car. alarm that's timing you can't even do that. by the way i know you're setting you're timing your car. alarms off to. go together like why the [ __ ] would she even want that to. be happening right well to. sabotage this is how i wake up. sorry dude my alarms don't work i gotta use my car. right right i mean hey someone bicycle. up to my car and throw a brick. at the hood every morning. right whoever designed that. [ __ ] music song is [ __ ] so foreign music is absolutely rolling in it dude i made that i made that song that [ __ ] so uh what's your advice when she comes up and she says hey you're you're scheduling your car alarms. to go off you say you're a dragon. right because no no no. because i'm not done talking right. i thought you were well now. but you'll say i'm a dragon. and she says no i'm not and i say so we're both. liars or so. we're both equally right. yeah yeah well but shorten it up. right no what i said. is better so we're both. liars no yeah okay. yeah yeah yeah and then kick her crutch. out from under and watch her stand fine. see now you know she's alive right. yeah yeah yeah i think that honestly. that's uh yeah you should say. you i think the the real. thing is you just gotta be like i'm not doing. that you gotta get off my property. right yeah you're coming at me. hostile you're accusing me of. something that's not happening. you're on my property you gotta. get off and and absolutely do not. make the mistake of doing it. again because what you wanna. do is avoid it in the future. cause she's crazy she's gonna continue to. think it none of it. matters what she thinks just you want to. stop her from coming over and saying it or ringing. your doorbell ever people are. delusional huh. like yeah you know what i mean. have your husband behind the door. on the right when she comes in and says that and then and then she says hello. and she says yeah you're timing your you're you're sabotaging my sleep. have the husband just in your shots. say is that the neighbor. again that'll be very creepy. too and she probably won't come. by she's old though she won't even [ __ ] hear it all people can't hear anything is she old i'm assuming if she's gonna crush and it's crazy who's assuming all right next one chris and matt what's going on guys i just want to. say i love you guys. appreciate what you guys do. all the advice you give and chris your comedy. is hysterical man please come to. st louis we need you here i will but i got a bit of a question. for you guys today um i work. for a pool company and some of the pools. we clean are really hard. to access and uh one pool in particular. has a hill in their backyard. that we have to. go down with our equipment and it's muddy it's mulchy and it's covered. in dog [ __ ] um covered like it's an unreasonable. amount and they won't pick. it up i've left. door hangers i've left voicemails i've knocked on the door. and asked them to. specifically pick it up the guy. comes out and he goes yeah. i don't really have time. i have 15 kids blah. blah blah i said 15. kids if you have 15. kids you don't need a dog. but i just don't know. what to do about it. because it gets on. my equipment and my shoes. and i you know can't really do anything. about it i'm not going. to pick up the poop for them. so uh if you guys got any advice let me know appreciate it. peace i do is it is. it 1860 because why. does he have 15. kids it's only you only have 15. kids if it's 1860 oh he's in utah. here's my advice the guy has 15. kids put one of them. to work to pick. up the dog [ __ ] yeah that's really a good idea you're 15 of them what are you doing there's one out of 15. put seven of them to. work immediately but also dude. like if you have a pool guy i would bet. you have a gardener so right. the gardener should be figuring that out i mean. the guy look it doesn't matter. the guy is being asked to. pick up his dog. [ __ ] because someone who comes to. you but it is his house. i know but he has 15. kids yeah look it's it's it's one. of those things that's like dude. be a buddy man pick up. the [ __ ] you're making me trudge through. horseshit i think honestly. the move for real. i know i think i know what you're going. to do yeah you do the move. is yeah to. be out there and just take a [ __ ] [ __ ] right where the [ __ ] dog shits are okay and be there long enough to. where the guy comes. out and he says what are you doing and then you say this. is the place where you take [ __ ] clearly yeah so i'm just doing what you'd like me to. do underst yeah because i've really got to. go to the bathroom. and the thing i was going. to say is pick it pick it up. and put it all in the pool. you're going to get fired. well that's maybe a good reason. not to do it. um uh just [ __ ] where the [ __ ] is bro. now that's disgusting dude. he wouldn't even care though. he would just let it stay. there and then you got to. come back and you're all your [ __ ] as well it's kind of a loselose. just i don't know pick. it up and put it on the door. like near the doorway right. so he has to. clean it up right right. right yeah that's rough dude. i say take a [ __ ] where they you know i would say like forge a path like sweep the [ __ ] out of the way. and just create a path. for you to be able. to walk through that is shitless and then what the dogs. are going to. [ __ ] there and the next time it's going to. be there maybe ew dude. doesn't it smell so bad. also was that an exaggeration does. this guy have [ __ ] 15 kids dude if you have 15 kids you are just living wrong you know what i mean get snipped dude he's religious for sure yeah he is he's also in 1860 yeah which is hard to. reason with someone from that is living 160. years before you you know what i mean. mmhmm it's hard to. reason with that yeah i understand. that yeah all right. will we really help that. guy go ahead next hi matt. hi beautiful here i absolutely. love you guys i have been a baby. since day one the cult. is diverse so i live a pretty. unconventional life um as a digital nomad. i've wanted to be a nomad. for a very long time. so this is kind of my dream. situation i absolutely love it. i am an accounting consultant um and i absolutely. love that relationship wise i. have recognized at some point. before my digital nomad journey. that i'm just not cut out. for relationships when i do. decide to talk to. um guys which isn't often i usually try. to set boundaries right. away i don't want to. like lead anyone on or hurt. anybody but i met a guy that. i think i might be falling. for i think about him. way too much and he's just he's been a total. gentleman and i think he really. likes me too so i feel. like he wants a relationship. and he's a relationship guy. i can tell so what do. you think i'm thinking that it's probably. unsafe to keep talking to. him because i don't see a situation. long term where we both. would be satisfied um thank you. so much you guys are awesome. oh sweet yeah uhhuh. yeah i don't know either. no i guess we'll find it. all right dude that was webster. he doesn't know what a digital. nominated either [laughter] dude. what the [ __ ] is a digital nomad. chris what it's when you work. from wherever you are. you know people like work remotely some people do that. and they just are always traveling. she was really really really pushing. that [ __ ] like she was trying to. sell some merch with digital. nomad on it she should start a podcast. called all right well look yeah okay um so you travel a lot. and uh you're a digital nomad. and that's cool and you met. this dude and you really like him. but you know sometimes look here's the deal. dude um sometimes things this. is so basic. but it's just so true. things change you like this. guy and maybe you want to. explore something different in your life. you know what i mean. maybe you want to. [ __ ] hang out with this guy maybe you want a date you know he's a relationship. type guy but relationships don't work for you. but guess what dude. knocking on your door. is change open. it up and maybe just maybe you will. find it fulfilling in your digital. nomad life that you might want a relationship and you'll be a digital stayathome mom. the thing uh just is just to. stay open the thing that bothers me. but that people do is they're like i'm not. like that so that thing. that i've never tried and never experienced. and never let happen in one. way in one form or another. is just not gonna work for me. like how the [ __ ] do you even know yep if you liked the guy and he likes you and the relationship. is possible on the horizon. uh don't be like oh i don't get into. relationships oh i don't like relationships. all relationships don't work for. me you don't know you haven't [ __ ] dated this guy before give it a shot at least [ __ ] try see what happens my whole. thing is just things change man. okay we said that. i know but like that doesn't change it. doesn't change but but it does. change like you think one. way and then another thing. happens and then dude you never know. you know you just never know. give it a shot it. might be love dude. you know try it. out let it go let it happen. see if you can be happy. see if it works give yourself a chance give him. a chance give life a chance. it's not about being giving him. a chance it's about. giving yourself a chance isn't. it oh we are safe that. was horrible the way you're saying that. is give him a chance you. look great today man. yeah outfit on fleek hair. looks good nice wow. fleek i haven't thought of that you look don't really consider myself. a little bit of a caffeine. addict but um i have around three. cups a day and if it's not a cup of coffee. i only get ice americano. really makes my uh motor go however. i'm experiencing either one of two. things that happen i crash. really hard around like three from like a workday or i can't. fall asleep i'm wide awake. like i feel like my eyes. are wide awake. while i'm trying to. sleep so i've been trying. to wind it back. down to maybe one cup a day. but i'm so unproductive. i'm sitting here making videos. for this podcast uh while i should be working one way i guess. what's a happy medium. how many cups are like good. for you guys what do you guys. settle with and how do you avoid that. like zigzag of ups and downs. or just staying up all night. thanks look bro. you're my guy like i would hang with this. guy yeah this guy's like three cups. of coffee keeps me. [ __ ] awake one cup of coffee. completely i i'm too tired. all day how many cups. of coffee should i have two. is this a children's show. calvin would be like two here's the thing. though there's too much. one is enough here's something. though too if you want. to keep it at one. your body will get used to. it just ride it [ __ ] come on come. on write it out you know. what i mean write it. out write it out write it out. write it out but also if you want to. know about me because since he asked. they did he did he asked. i drink a pot of coffee. when i wake up i drink a potato. drink a pot of coffee. right after that i drink. a lot of coffee throughout the rest of the day. and i'll drink two cups. of coffee right. before bed and i will fall the [ __ ] asleep and it won't matter that i just drink coffee. really yeah you literally have been complaining about not being able. to sleep it has nothing to. do with coffee uh that's that's through. with anxiety and there's a trust and a deep deep disillusionment with the world. and the nine pots of coffee. i drink all day. and also the nine pots of coffee. i drink all day. no but seriously though uh but that's just me. that is very uncommon nobody that. i know is like that you drink. two cups to. find that happy balance is. what i think you were saying. yeah no but this is the greatest. if you want to. cut it down in general. your body will readjust to. just the one but he doesn't want. to cut it down necessarily well he actually did. say yeah he's trying. to cut it down yeah yeah if you're trying. to cut down your body. will readjust just give it. a minute try two try. two yeah that's very obvious. try two yeah uh wow i wish i was with you. and i could be like dude. [ __ ] you're saying too many is three is too many. ones i've tried two you [ __ ] idiot and we would have a good time. dude laughing yeah. he would laugh i would love that. dude he looks like a good guy. he's got good hair yeah you know. he's blonde what's up. with that i know well blonde. people can't blond dudes. can't wear leather jackets unless they're brown. but anyway i've i might have to. come around on blonde. guys because that guy no dude. blond dudes are very handsome they're just not sexy. he was sexy he was kind of sexy. but if he was brunette. imagine if he was brunette. dude i don't know he looked uniquely he had like the jake bucy. thing going on and i think he looked hot. jake bucy is not hot. dude he was like a hot. jake bucy okay okay. well what about [ __ ] chris hemsworth. dude handsome yeah he kind of looked like pretty. sexy chris evans there's an example of a blonde. dude that is handsome and just zero. sexy christian no chris evans because evans isn't blonde. he is blonde what the [ __ ] he was captain america. captain america's blonde no he's not. dude he's blonde yes brunette. no [ __ ] he's dirty blonde. trying to gaslight me. dude he's dirty blonde at best. i'm not standing for it. pull up a picture of what happens. dude chris evans is. [ __ ] uh he's got zero uh uh well click on one click on one make it bigger well that's obviously blonde. that that honestly that's died. though yeah he's gonna move go. to go go to. like look at him brunette. that's yeah i guess it kind of is but he's got like a ginger. feel to him okay. but he's got brunette hair. i guess he kind of does. huh yeah he's blonde he you. know what he feels blonde. yeah he's not that's worse. to actually have the good [ __ ] but seem blonde yeah. but imagine if he was blonde. dude just seriously he'd be like what's that. you'd be around and be like what's that. noise it'd be all the pieces. drying up yeah yeah yeah you gotta bleep it. out so the guy on the episode. the guy that called in is way. hotter than chris evans. of course he's blonde of course. of course but yeah two cops. okay okay next oh look at that. what's up matt what's up. chris jonathan from alabama long. time listener i mean you're not. right you're not so not in alabama. am i right right. i mean and it's fine. to be there because maybe you've been there. for a while but if you're gonna say i'm from alabama. in that way clear it. up afterwards or clear. up where you're really from. boy yeah you're [ __ ] get on this is michael from mississippi. hello i am from absolutely. anywhere but russia [laughter]. dude okay so we get it. you live in alabama we're having some fun. with you but you look great. in your pink lips. right sorry that's a secret edition. special edition that you can't get anymore. and this guy [ __ ] scooped it. up dude all right. this guy's lips though he's a good. guy yeah i like this. guy i would immediately hang out with gekko yeah with my brother. i have a italian. restaurant and um that makes sense all the time. together but he doesn't seem to. understand the value of downtime and hobbies and relaxing um maybe you can. give me some advice and tell him how to. chill without me sounding preachy yeah. uh and just how you guys. deal with uh over work yeah um see you september. 9 in atlanta live rips. hell yeah you're the man. right that's cool this. guy seems like such a sweet. dude um i actually i i sympathize. with what he's saying because people that i love that i'm close. to that are true. workaholics that don't know how to. calm down it makes me. anxious and it makes me. worried about them because you got to. [ __ ] chill out otherwise you're going gonna die. at 55. yeah you know. what i mean so work. isn't everything but the way to. convey that to the guy. is tricky because maybe he's defensive. maybe he doesn't have anything he's definitely expensive. i was talking you know. what i mean i was talking when he discovered me. right go ahead uh and so i think that maybe there's a way. to at first at least on oops. on your downtime invite him. along and don't let don't take no. for an answer you know. what i mean my whole. thing about these dudes that just go. go go go go like for what you're you're for what. for more money for more you're only running. from something that's what i mean. i think that yeah they can't. answer that because the truth. is they don't realize to. do right it's like an addict it's akin to. being an addict yes. i know people who do this. and quite frankly they're awful. they're awful to be around. why is it they're just they're always working. and you're like oh i can't hang out. with that person yeah it's they're annoying. they're always talking and saying something [ __ ] about work and it's just like okay you're not a real person. to me i'm not saying that's what your brother. is like i don't know your brother. but there is such value. in chill time if he has a family i don't know well he obviously. has some family i mean. you're his brother but like yeah yeah invite him. along to your [ __ ] and say dude. try this with me i'm with your bro. i'm your brother let's just take a [ __ ] chill day. [ __ ] this fake italian restaurant. because we're obviously not italian. right and we're in alabama. we're so confused right. let's figure out who we are and let's do this. now i think that uh i think that you also. could if you want to. you could say if you don't want to. sound preachy you could say dude. i'm just like i'm a little i'm not like worried. about you but like it. concerns me that you all you ever want to. do is work all you ever. care about is work like maybe we could you could. hang out with me we could do some stuff. this and that whatever but like if you come. from a place of concern rather than like this. is how you should live your life. i think that that's there's a big difference in that. and someone who's prone to. being defensive will get less defensive if you're coming out. of a place of concern yeah or they'll just be like it's fine. don't worry and then you're like oh okay. but anyway yeah maybe but i'm just giving the guy. options all right yeah let's get the noodles. from the van then okay. well all right see you in uh atlanta chris matt. what's up love the show. chris huge fan of congratulations. going on your show in boston in november. for it so me and my girlfriend. are having a baby boy in two. weeks and my question for you. guys is what do you think about. godparents is it necessary. to have them we're not really religious. so we're not too stressed. about it but a lot. of people are asking us and at this. point it almost seems like a tradition so yeah we just want to. know what you guys think. do we need to. have them and uh thank you. for everything thanks for the show. life rips bye hell. yeah it's so cute. racial couple um so uh i think that's great. i didn't realize we were watching. peacock tv that's all well do you have advice uh you have a kid i do you're his godfather yeah. uh that's nothing really you. know so why did you do. it because of tradition and i want you to. be as close to. him as possible because you're my brother. and i want if it means something to. him later on down. the line i want him to. have that and i want him. to have it with you. almost teared up i think the thing. about kept it in check i think the thing. about godparents is less. about religion and more about um like the idea of responsibility. in in the parents absence. if something happened to. you there would be this. like not legal not binding. responsibility but spiritual uh responsibility. for your son i will always look out. for calvin because you i mean. obviously i would anyway but you know. the idea of a godparent is if anything were to. happen to the actual parent. the godparent will always be there. no matter what because you have that. person's word because you love. them and because you're close. to them and what are you. doing i'm not even going to. look tell me what you're doing. right now you zoomed into. my face when you were talking. it was only on me. oh let's go down. here let's get down anxiety. okay uh yeah i think that that. the i i think god parent. is misleading because people that don't understand. or have never done it. think it's religious but it's not. it's not it's just like this. this like well the word god is in it. you know yeah it might as well be [ __ ] it's very religious but it's not it's not really religious to. you no it's just like it's just like a a a it's kind of a beautiful. thing that parents can do. to sort of say without a lot. of words you are sort of like the backup. parent yeah background that's good. call it backup parent. if you don't want to. do it don't do it. but like you know don't feel pressure. but if you feel like doing it. there's someone in your life. that you think you'd sort of want to. bestow the honor on do it. it's [ __ ] valentine's day it's a hallmark [ __ ] you know what i mean it's like it means something but it doesn't really mean something unless you die. in a plane crash next. wow you'll be fine. bro you know what it. might mean something to. the kids so why don't you just do. it if you have someone who's obviously clearly. going to be the person. then just do it yeah right. if not then that's some difficult. decision yeah hey chris and matt i love what you guys do thank you for all the awesome. episodes and uh i hope you can answer. my question two months ago. i matched with a girl. and we have so much. in common more than any other girl. that i've dated and i've been around. the block so that tells me a lot. uh we've been talking on the phone. and texting daily i speak russian. fluently so that's no issue. i have an attorney from alabama. i'm a [ __ ] and i gained. feelings for her and so did she uh she actually asked me. if i could come and visit her and seeing as there's a ton. of strict sanctions in russia um i could go there. but that would not be any good for me. since my credit card and debit card simply will not work so clearly that's off the menu. so by the looks of it. i have two options. i stopped talking to her. or i wait until the war. ends and the banking systems go back. into play but honestly who knows how long that'll be. so what do you recommend. i do should we try. and make this work or should i stop wasting. her time i can tell she wants to. keep it going because the second she wakes up to. go to work she texts me. the second she gets home. from work she calls me. uh she sends me photos of her. family or her nieces uh her nephews her. her mom her sisters. i mean we're really close. and so i can tell she wants to. keep it going but i'm not exactly. sure she understands that i probably. won't see her for quite. a long time which goes back. to me asking myself. should i just end this. now and stop wasting her time. or or not maybe the answer. is obvious and i'm overthinking. but i would love your guys's. input thank you here's my impression. of this guy right. now you're getting taken for a ride. why well he's not giving her. money yeah but dude. that's what it's leading. to dude she's giving him [ __ ] pictures of his her niece and [ __ ] like that's way too much info it's way too much info it's not real dude this is this dude right here you gotta take it for a ride i actually didn't even think that i don't think i agree she's not asking him for money dude not yet dude because right now it's just like this i'm gonna add a caveat to. everything i'm saying i i i if she ever asks. you for money then everything. i'm saying flushes down the [ __ ] toilet but what i would say is came what i would say is you [ __ ] uh what i don't like what i don't like is when [ __ ] like take it upon themselves to. decide for some woman to. be like oh you don't know. what you're getting into. like she's not a [ __ ] adult. she's an adult she can decide whatever the [ __ ] she wants if you don't want. to keep doing it. then you don't do it. but don't take her agency. away from her and be like you don't know what you're getting. into sweetheart trust me. this is a way bigger. deal than you realize i'm going. to cut i'm going to. cut the cord now because you don't know. what you're getting into. don't do that it's not your responsibility. it's your responsibility to. look out for you and don't be a [ __ ] piece of [ __ ] too hard. now if she asks you for money. you're gonna take it for a ride. and you're a [ __ ] idiot and i can tell you want to. say something because you won't stop moving. so go ahead that's my is that. my dude that's him i think you missed. my but nothing's happened. yet that's why he's he's not like let me. out yeah but a lot of guys willfully. give women money that they've never met. before right and that's fine. but dude my point. is you gotta dude. you have to. just you're get you're why can't she can she come. see him i was gonna say get her. the [ __ ] out of russia. get her out of her. hey dude go away from the war. part yeah and also go away. get the people you love away. from the war why are you. wanting to go over. there you guys talk. about debit and credit cards you're gonna die. dude don't go to. russia you [ __ ] my question is here is the deal. i can speak russian fluently. i love when bullets. are whizzing by my head sometimes. i love when bullets. hit my head um i would like to. go to russia is this a good idea. since i am so in love with bullets. riddling my body and whizzing by. my head and sometimes hitting my head. they're not fighting you guys. in russia i know. i know i know i get it. so but also it's a bad idea to. go to russia while russia. is waging a [ __ ] war yeah. dude on ukraine and potentially uh more of the world. obviously don't do that full stop if she's so [ __ ] into. you as well get her the [ __ ] out of there. and have her join you wherever. you are in [ __ ] alabama or wherever you are just take the seat. belt off buddy and get out. this is a ride one. way or another it is. dude also there's people around you hey guy look yeah. just go outside you should look closer. than right now i mean. dude it couldn't be further i am. on a dating app that is actually intergalactical um i met. this person who was four. foot

school. this was you know six. seven years ago. and you know it. cost a lot of money but it was a portrait of myself. whoa wow and my mom. didn't want it my dad. didn't want it oh that's a picture. so i just put it up. in my office but now when i i mean. it's mostly ironically but when i take zoom. calls yep well it doesn't look. like you anymore that's over. my shoulder so they'd be like why is daniel tosh. behind you what do. you do when someone gives you a gift. that you don't want and you can't. even pawn it off. on somebody wow that's perfect. yeah because this thing it's got to. go thanks guys uh give it to. the coworker that you have a crush on it. and be like do you like this. do you like the guy in this. you know and like so you don't have to. like you can't be accused of anything. crash or cross at the workplace. yeah but you can if she says no and gets offended. be like that's not me. and if she says yes i'll be like okay. so you like this guy and then hold it. up next to you and see. if she sees the similarity and [ __ ] like that that's hilarious. that that somebody gave you a picture. of yourself of you that. big and it's a picture not a painting. that's a photo it's a photo. yeah i guess it was yeah. dude um yeah toss it. i mean i'm not cinnamon. [ __ ] get rid of that why would you want to. keep that toss it. throw it rip it. up first so people don't [ __ ] see it in the trash. can burn it and do like a thing. like cast away like yeah castaway. yeah okay cool burn. it all right you want to. burn it sanders burn it. sanders no not burn it burn. it sanders we cannot burn. it say that saw you. in phoenix you absolutely killed. it i'm just gonna tell you um just like you're my friend. um so um i come from a very catholic. family pray the rosary church every day that type of catholic. anyways i um left the church. and now i'm getting married. and um we are both um do. not want to get married. in the catholic church. um but that has kind of created. a lot of you answered. your question already and tension. in the family where um people. are like we're not gonna go to. the wedding because that's a mortal. sin to not get married. in the church wow um so i need your advice. like is it even like worth. throwing a wedding where like your family. will show up and like be kind of unhappy. about it or they won't come. and then i'll feel bad or i guess. i just i don't know. what to do should we just elope. i think maybe i was going. to say maybe a little because they're not grateful. they don't care about you. or respect you hello. enough to go to. your [ __ ] wedding just because not at the catholic. church and they let them know. that they can be catholic. all they want but let them know that. the rest of the world. finds the catholic church just as synonymous with [ __ ] child molesters and [ __ ] raping kids than it does with [ __ ] god and priests like they need to. get their [ __ ] head checked and realize the catholic. church is not what they [ __ ] used to. remember it as oh well. yeah they're old school though yeah but that's why. she needs to [ __ ] tell him. yeah i'd also say like if you disrespect. me that much and won't even come to. my wedding then [ __ ] you i'm going. to vegas yeah [ __ ] yeah yeah elope a lobe for sure yeah dude do you got to. do what you want to. do this is a wedding. and i know i know a lot of times people. think like weddings the wedding. is really for everyone else. but it's not dude it's for you. dude it's a beautiful time. in your life you know. i just got married. and like you get to. share that moment with that person and it's a memory that you're going. to create with them. dude and uh you got to. do it yourself you got to. do it for yourself. don't get married. in the church dude. don't get married. in the church you're going. to [ __ ] talk about resentment. you're going to be resent. yeah resentful to your [ __ ] family for pressuring you for doing something that you didn't want. to do on a day. that's supposed to. be your [ __ ] day yeah yeah and you know what sometimes i come in and i just hit the [ __ ] truth. with the hammer right. okay i mean sometimes i do jokings. and [ __ ] and sometimes i [ __ ] make fun of people but sometimes i come in and i just [ __ ] hit the truth of the hammer and that's what you gotta do dude and that's what's good about me i think i hit the truth. of the hammer before you. did i started hitting the word. i started image i used i. started hitting the truth of the hammer. and then you joined in because you're a follower. i hit the truth of the hammer. you were like kind of like saying. the truth but i hit the truth. of the hammer nope the truth. with the hammer i hit it. with a sledgehammer what's going. on where were you she that. that lady by the way. yeah had a fantastic. nose she did and she also said really. nice glasses they remind me. of this pair of my glasses. okay but i'm being nicer. because her nose is actually part. of her face and you're just saying that. accessories don't take it from. me i'm saying her nose that nose is. a great nose okay. okay i [ __ ] love her nose okay relax but i'm just saying no that's it. okay we've got another one. hello can i take your order. i'm reaching out because i just got engaged and we are getting. married in april and obviously i'm the girl so i'm planning. it and i have no idea. what i'm doing and i don't know. what matters i don't know. what people actually care about and what do. you do you have any advice. on weddings what matters because there's so many. things that you're supposed. to do any regrets any do's or don'ts um like flower. girls and first like first look. and the garter belt like do you do the flower. toss and do we care we actually care did. you do that so that's my question. also for

whatever the [ __ ] you want doesn't matter a wedding. is [ __ ] nothing oh wow it's just the worst advice. of all the a wedding a wedding. is just the quickness of going. from just to. the sound is
