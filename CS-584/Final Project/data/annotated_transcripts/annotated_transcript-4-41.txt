guess my mom is my mom yeah um oh that's another one i want to. add to the soundboard. the jayz insecure laugh. we're gonna do some soundboard. [ __ ] so yeah so serial killers man i always you always know i'm just i'm tired of the [ __ ] people not knowing i feel like when this podcast starts when when people watch the podcast they start the podcast and then it and then they watch it and then by the time the podcast is at the end of the podcast. we have like two viewers left. um oh i [ __ ] totally forgot i went. to get xrays of my [ __ ] tummy. remember i told you guys. i had a tummy hurt. and i went to. get xrays with the tummy. and the lady was like and the lady. was like uh oh dude. i was already yep talk about the angry. olympics man i was at the [ __ ] uh xray place second. time i've been there first time. she wouldn't let me she wouldn't. let me do it because she thought my uh insurance. wasn't paid but it was paid. okay that's it that's all you. got to know. so i left dude. and i leave and i go like this. i give her my card she says oh it's not. coming up chris dele is there. any other name that it. would be under what are you. talking about hi i'm crystalia. look that up and that works. and if it doesn't it's your fault. like what are you talk. every time you give your [ __ ] insurance card to. people they're like okay so okay. make it better insurance. cards but it always works. it always ends up. working which is the worst. part because you know you're right. you give your insurance card and then people are like i don't see it. and you're you just you're ready. for the i don't see it. already you give her the th your name. could be literally uh [ __ ] you know suck. [ __ ] like the easiest thing. to spell okay so suck shit. is there another way to. spell it and you're like nah. just suck [ __ ] that's my name. is it are you sure. it's not chit what am i. mexican and uh and they're like okay. all right well let me let me. do you have the social security. sure yeah it's not coming up. they say all right. well just can you try again. let me try something else okay. see here it is try. that first you know. what i'm talking about it's always some [ __ ] lady with like a tattoo on her. chest and you're just like this. [ __ ] lady has a tattoo on her chest of like the san francisco 49ers. logo and and then you're like and then you're like okay. cool and so this time. though i went to. go get the xrays and she was like it's not coming. up and i was like all right. i'm gonna [ __ ] drive home i'm prepared. to drive home and have it. not work so i can stir. in this it didn't work. the system failed me. you know what i mean. i could stir in this the system. failed me type uh feeling. and just feel that all day. and feel like i know shit's failing. out there but i did what i had to. do i brought my insurance. card to the xray. place it didn't work that. wasn't my fault even. though literally this [ __ ] could be killing me in my stomach i'm like the system. failed me i'm good this. is how i think for real. so i drove home i'm like [ __ ] it all right. cool i fire off an email. to somebody who the insurance. thing i'm like why is it. not working they send me. another one so now i get the other new. insurance card which is still the same plan. i'm all paid up everything. is fine so now i drive. down there today and i'm like can't. wait for this one not to. work i'll drive home even. faster right system fails me. twice [ __ ] it dude i lived a good life. and uh so i get there. and i say you know. just like head wobbling so much i give [ __ ] george clooney a run for his money. just like hey how you doing i got my fresh insurance. card i've never used it. before first one i even had the two. on you know how to. give you two attached together. i didn't detach them i. had the two on there. i gave her both of them. here's one for last time. and one for this time. and i said here it. is [ __ ] her acrylic nails. yeah see the anger now. is in the middle of my chest. at yeah see yeah see it's not it's not oh yeah. i remember you coming la. yeah yeah because you said the thing didn't work. and so i got a new card. and i'm all paid up. and then over that for a fact. now and so here's my card. yeah okay she hit me. with that tone and i'm feeling good. dude because i can't wait to. drive home even faster and let the system. fail me twice so i can be right. twice is there another way. to spell your name always with that. again dude nope it's chrisdelia she says okay. well let me try the not do. you have social security. let me try the policy. no okay she said you know. what i can try. then i'm there [ __ ] 10 minutes. i said did you try. with the apostrophe after the d. and she said the asterisk yeah. like aaliyah was a [ __ ] typo like aaliyah was in there in lieu of another last name so i was like nah it's just it yeah okay hey look you can call it a [ __ ] monster truck if you want to. as long as it's dangling on. the upper half of the d. we're good and uh she was like she was. like okay um [music] i said listen. i said so what are we gonna do. here i i literally i literally said that. i said so what are gonna. do here because this has worked everywhere. else and it hasn't only worked here twice. now and i've used it. since the last time. and it worked so what. do we do i said and she said i said that. and she said well um i could try. something else and i said yeah. you should try that and she said. i am and i was like oh oh we're taking steps here. we're taking steps to. the octagon you didn't have. to say i am because you already said. you could try something else when you throw on when you tack. on that second im. you're opening the gate. to the octagon because i just replied. to your you're doing it. and i said yeah you should try. that but then when you hit me. with another i am the only thing. we're wearing are trunks so i calmed down i remember dude. i've been doing a lot of therapy. i think what will kristen. do okay chill well. kristen i [ __ ] didn't have time to. go get a bunch of [ __ ] presents. and give to her because that's what. kristen would have done i got here's a loot. bag and uh yeah and so i [ __ ] waited and she was like she goes like this. oh okay here it is. and i s and i said oh yeah yeah oh well yeah that makes sense. and she was like okay so yeah here's the deal. it was d space. elia and i was like yeah. well that should have been something you tried. probably last week when i was here. but i guess they don't have a space for an asterisk anyway. i went in and i got the [ __ ] xray i said thank you very much i appreciate it. i know it's difficult to. get through all this [ __ ] waited went to. get the xray leaned on my side. the bigass [ __ ] xray [ __ ] and the nurse. was sweet she was like are. you trying to be here. and and what what'd she. say she was like you don't want. people to know like she was. like you don't want are you. trying to get out of here. without people noticing you it. was just sweet it was. like like she thought i was [ __ ] tom cruise or some [ __ ] nobody gives a [ __ ] if it's just first of all i'm a mask on and i'm [ __ ] getting xrays like she thought tmz was gonna be outside or some [ __ ] and i was like oh it's not a big deal she's like what and then she dude what's up with people they just throw you for a loop sometime i was like oh no it's fine and she was like yeah i know who you are i was like oh that's cool and she was like do you have a meeting or something and i and i and i was like oh a meeting and she was like yeah you like have a meeting or something and i was like no i just are we learning. english like what is this do you have a meeting yes it's at 4. pm central sometimes people just hit. you with some weird [ __ ] dude like you're just getting the xray and the nurse. is like do you have a meeting. and you got to. be like no you know. it's one of those things where you literally. think am i the [ __ ] idiot here cause this. is a very basic. thing to ask somebody. do you have a meeting and it's so basic. that you already know the answer. so quickly but it has nothing to. do with anything that you've been talking. about so you're just like well the answer. can't be that simple like i start. thinking like it is meeting. a [ __ ] term for something else medically like that i'm in this hospital. but then i just you don't have any answer. so you're literally just like okay. well i don't have a meeting so i'm just gonna answer. it that way and i just say no. you know what i mean. one time i was driving late. at night i was in high school. and this i i see the sirens on the up. in the back of of my car. a policeman is pulling. me over and i'm like wow. i don't know what i was doing. wrong you know sometimes you trick. yourself into. thinking i don't know what i'm doing. wrong but you know. you're a little bit speeding or you. were texting or what this. was before cell phones. and uh he pulls me. over and i'm like all right. i don't know what i did. i really don't and he says he i rolled the window. down a cop rolls. up he says hey and i said hey and he says um do you know. why i pulled you over. and i said uh no i i i don't was i s was i speeding and he said no. and i said oh okay. and he said well i pulled. you over because you were driving. this is what he said and i quote he says you were driving. rather gingerly and i took a beat and i i thought okay well that's okay because uh that's not bad and then i took another beat and i actually thought do i know what gingerly. means and i said to. him i said that's okay. right and he said oh yeah it's very okay. and now i'm like am i in twin. peaks because i don't understand. what's happening and i said oh okay. and he said sometimes if people have had too much. to drink they drive very carefully and i said oh okay. well i haven't had anything to. drink and he said i could see that. now and i said okay so i was just driving carefully and he said yeah. he said well have a good. day and be safe getting home. and i was like okay. the weirdest [ __ ] [ __ ] ever but sometimes people just throw you for a [ __ ] loop dude. with these questions and i remember right. as the window was closing. he stopped and turned around and he said do you have a meeting [laughter]. anyway dude i guess that's it. this was fun man. i told you it's fun. doing this podcast because i [ __ ] forget. these things that happened in my life. like that thing with that cop. i totally haven't thought about that. in years and sometimes i think of [ __ ] all the time. like there was another story i told you i think all the time. of my buddy ryan when he said the thing. about what was it. the king candy the candy. yeah the candy in a factory yeah. um yeah i think about that. all the time but yeah it's good. to share those stories with you and also the ones. that [ __ ] make me think of them when i'm in because when i do this podcast i only had like let's see one two three things to. talk about and um sometimes i like to. do that because it makes me. nervous like i don't have. enough to talk about and then when i do it. it i'm in like this. fight or flight mode. to where it's like i have to. come up with other [ __ ] you know. i do this on stage. a lot too like i'll go. up with one idea and i'll just start. talking about it but it it's it's a lot. of fun doing this. podcast because i know i have to. fill at least in whatever. [ __ ] hour or something of stuff. and then so i start thinking about other things it's really fun. to do so i really appreciate you. guys i really appreciate you. guys listening to. this um so yeah dude. uh i'll close it up. by saying thanks for uh the uh all the patreon love. it's been really [ __ ] sweet and uh don't forget. to [ __ ] gently graze up against that subscribe. button and gently graze up. against that like button and also when if you're there you know just kind of gently throw a warm. breeze over to. the [ __ ] bell notifications you know just [ __ ] do you know what i mean i'd like you to.
