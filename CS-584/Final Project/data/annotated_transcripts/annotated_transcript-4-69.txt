[ __ ] and walks away. and you heard it quietly. wow dude imagine that i here's the thing. there's a thing i'm not religious. at all i'm not catholic. i grew up catholic. but then when i had to. go to church. so much and everyone the and the [ __ ] church and the pope. and the priest was always going i'm like i i'm a head out. you know here we go man. i wish i was my meanie now. as i was then because i would be as a kid. i would just be like stop doing that. or if they broke you mean. you're not gone nice cookies and let me. tell you something no no i'm not religious. if the pope goes ah and then smacked and and and and then smacked her like that and then and then walked off now he says pope. francis sorry for hitting women's. hand on new year's. bro if the pope. goes like this guess what she got what she deserved not sorry. all of a sudden i'm religious. okay i'm thinking a vow of celibacy. i'm not [ __ ] my girl i'm a pope. okay i'm a pope i'm oh what do you call it. priests all of a sudden i became a priest because that's respect. did stand by for stand. by what you do that's why. ricky gervais snead's to. be the pope he killed it. it's so funny people let me. tell you something he really killed it. from all app he was killing. it everyone was laughing. not everyone was laughing. but the [ __ ] were not laughing. a lot of people in hollywood. need to save face and they can't. be seen laughing at that. [ __ ] but you know that shit's funny. this article opinion ricky. gervais on the independent. ricky gervais steeping the golden globes. in overshadowed vital political statements. from the ho from who a guy. with a show on hulu. hey dude see ya from oh the chick. from [ __ ] fargo cachi. who gives a [ __ ] about an actor saying anything that they wrote that's so annoying. and another thing in times like these this. is a test what you don't. give a [ __ ] gervaise killed it. it was sharp it was on point. he was funny and confident. dude here's the other thing. they're acting like he cheapened. it some people the fringe is acting like what. he did was immature do you know. how hard what he did. is the answer's no i know. how hard what he did. is because i'm a comedian. it is so [ __ ] hard to. roast a roomful of people at them. about them and make them laugh. at all and he did that. also no political statements from actors are. vital whoever whatever cuck. wrote this is just unbelievable. dude i'm so tired of chucking. ass [ __ ] just so tired a cut can ask [ __ ] but guess what we found somebody posted this i told you i posted. is that all job interview. is not over yet. hello he said bender bo. hey soto job interviews not over. yet i told you we'd find. it the babies came through dude. how did the adhan how did he had a bee in front of interview. but that's some gangster [ __ ] uh so yeah did that pope. slap though i got to. get religious i wish he did. well why'd you grab me. like that all right you. [ __ ] grab me like that critics. dude critics at all though. critics at all like to. critic criticize they don't understand. they most of the time. make it worse for themselves. like it's just gonna add fuel. to the fire oh this. was a good one dude. take this guy oh this. was a good one they did. it off on me. somebody reviewed my act in chicago. i tweeted it somebody wrote where is it. he said my stuff. i talked a lot about i talk. a lot about what do. you call it the sensitive times and how it's okay. to make jokes and [ __ ] like that and the guy was was saying i shouldn't my whole my whole act to. say people get offended. at everything people get offended. at stuff that i say in my act. and it's not offensive. that's my whole point and somebody wrote and this. guy wrote this whole thing. was like yeah it was funny. and chris d'elia did a lot of funny. stuff for whatever the [ __ ] but it really took a turn down turn for the worse. and became not funny when he started talking. about how people are offended. at things when he doesn't even. have offensive material oh. hey do are you making my point. for me that's exactly what the joke. is is that i'm not offensive. yet people are offended and also because i do get all. the time people say on the fence of all the first of all. you listen this podcast. you guys have never heard this. podcast i say that i say [ __ ] that people get here look there it is and i was making fun of critics. in the thing i say hey look a critic. being upset that i'm making fun of critics. the fact that he said it. was funny until i brought it up. i love [ __ ] like this i was waiting for it can't wait till people i have this one bit in my act that people will blog about sometimes about how it's offensive. and [ __ ] and then i cuss that happened i started talking about it in my act and i start commenting on the times and how everyone's sensitive to. everything and how and this guy was like are just so missing the point. it's amazing how much critics. can just they just don't get it. do it you know what i mean. and i'm not trying to. be defensive i understand this. probably sounds defensive you know. if you're a hater of mine or whatever. the [ __ ] but like dude. to say you're making my point. for me how does that. happen how does that happen. that somebody misses a point. so glaringly obvious yeah it's just someone saying i say people's i say in my act like people get so mad. for people saying certain things and it's ridiculous. and then the critic says it's so ridiculous. he sayings that we can't. say something you know why. cuz what you have isn't a job. that's why if you criticize. comedy it's not a job i don't know the guys name. but it's probably [ __ ] spencer or some [ __ ] you know but anyway it's so on
