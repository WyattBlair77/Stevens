[ __ ] schoolteacher schedule mode you know that's not my [ __ ] dude my [ __ ] is johnny. stays up later than you. right so while i'm staying up later. than you dude i'm on my vampire. [ __ ] she's like can we go to. bed and find so i you know. i give in do it. because you don't want to. argue and so i give in and not that. we're gonna argue but i give in right. so i gave in once. and i went to. go to sleep. and all of a sudden i walk up. to my side of the bed. and i go over to. it and i'm like oh [ __ ] there's like a what the [ __ ] like there's a banana peel on the side of the bed. like just i guess cow. was eating a banana or something. just you know how you take i don't know. if you've ever seen like a banana. peel like 30 minutes after you're done. with it if you leave it. out it's like i don't know how it it dies. so quickly like it's so [ __ ] decayed brown like we have so many bananas. because cal wakes up and he says and so we give him. a banana and he eats habit. puts it down and then all of a sudden there's like this. brown [ __ ] decayed banana peel and i'm like this is so gross. and we throw it away. so there what is right. there's a decayed brown. banana peel next to my bed. now who knows how long it's been there. because it's nighttime right. it's night time and the bananas. are only eaten on the first. part of the day so this. decay banana peel has been there for a long time. because banana peels become brown. you know the whole saying banana. peels come become brown. after 30 minutes they after. 30 minutes that's a saying and so i go to. say i say oh babe. what the [ __ ] man you gave banana you gave you gave calvin a banana peel you've gave calvin a banana and you left the banana peel out here and i go down. to grab it and i go. to pick it up and it's stuck. to the carpet because it's gross. because the banana is sticking to. the carpet and then i go. down to grab it. again and then kristen says hey don't do that. honey that's [ __ ] it was [ __ ] it wasn't a banana peel it was clumps of [ __ ] i was trying to. pick up [ __ ] with no gloves. i was trying to. pick up [ __ ] with no [ __ ] pooper scooper i was just picking up [ __ ] like it was some m m's oh it was gross. dude my worst part was kristen watched. me do the whole [ __ ] thing from jump she saw me try to. pick it up one time and then try to. pick it up again. and then after that was the time. she decided to say hey honey don't pick. that up it's [ __ ] what about the first time. yant your hubby touching [ __ ] got a quick question for you fiance yacht. your hubby touch and [ __ ] all good if you do but please admit. it right now for the courtroom. you're a hubby touching [ __ ] so now i'm shitty hands i'm the new dick. tracy villain shitty hands and i'm [ __ ] pissed and then i say what the [ __ ] is [ __ ] and she says you thought it was a banana peel and now i look like a [ __ ] [ __ ] i look like an [ __ ] because we didn't have the conversation about how banana peels look all brown in like five minutes so now i'm like god damn it i got [ __ ] on my hands and i walk into. the [ __ ] bathroom to. wash my hands naturally and she says ew you just go to. pick it up without investigating it and i said i thought it was a banana. peel and she said it was way. too small to. be a banana peel and you know what god dammit is right. but i thought she picked up some of it. and left the other one that was left. to other pieces that were dirty. because she didn't get all. of it because she didn't. care but so then i go to. wash my hands i get the toilet. paper and i'm like i gotta clean. this [ __ ] up why i said why didn't so you knew [ __ ] was here and she was like i don't know and i was like well no if you knew she was here why didn't you clean it up and she said the most honest thing that anyone has ever said in the history of honest things she said well i kind of noticed it a while ago but then tried to. put it out of my brain. because i didn't want to. have to pick it up. ah i noticed it earlier. but kind of was pretending i didn't because i didn't want. to admit to. myself that's what you said. i didn't want to. admit to myself that there was [ __ ] on the floor. uh so now i gotta ask you that's fine. but you got your hubby to. have [ __ ] on his hands dude so now i'm all pissed and now i'm cleaning it i grabbed toilet paper she's like what are you doing i'm like well i got to. clean the [ __ ] [ __ ] off the thing and then i noticed like there's splotches of it on the rug. like and just like sam or butters or chenzo was. just dotting it they were just putting their anus. down on the rug. and they weren't even doing the dragon. thing they were just like walking. a little bit and then just sitting dot in the rug. with some [ __ ] just walking a little bit further. just dotting the [ __ ] rug. with some [ __ ] like they were like they were like worried that they were never gonna find their way back butters. and sam just ah you know. all you have to. do is follow the [ __ ] dots yeah yeah or just actually go to.
