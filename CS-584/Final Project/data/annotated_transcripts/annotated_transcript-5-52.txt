[ __ ] what did you make your kid a sandwich at one day no you didn't then nanny. dennett but god bless when i see. a poor mom with no. help with trick kids god bless madam. and i'm doing it like this. [ __ ] motto huh. like i'm holding a little baby. mouse [ __ ] mot on and you're looking at the mouse and you're going madam hey youse guys holding baby hold on one. baby mouse with two [ __ ] hands oh so so so that's that that's that with the with the what do you call it. a mother's day thing yeah being a mom is the hardest. job in the world unless you're one of those [ __ ] moms that's you know what i mean you know what i'm talking about in me hills with seven. nannies but mother's day. you know what a lot of these hallmark. holidays and even not that not just the hallmark. out well isn't it's almost like every every uh holidays a hallmark. holiday now i mean it's not but anyway. uh so just talking out of my ass. but i put up a post the other day. on instagram actually i tweeted. it and i wrote and this was you know. it annoys it it annoys me and that's that. it [ __ ] annoys me i wrote oh dude ivan get rid of has his chime on said ivan get rid of me. and [ __ ] more on fire. than i ever get rid of whatever. oh why does it annoy. me so much when people gush about their parents. on social media. on mother's father's day. why do you have to. share that [ __ ] with everyone who straightup doesn't give a [ __ ] it should be about you and your family and that's it you insane lunatics. i believe that a one fire. headed up on the prompter. sorry i believe that social media. is definitely exposing people's mental. illness like like like they say if you the more selfies to. take the more likely you'll be of narcissists. and that's definitely true. but it's like dude when you take like here's the deal. there's there are ways to. do it right like i think my brother. posted a thing about my. mom like i love my mom. happy mother's day that's fine. but if you're like he says me. and my mom i couldn't have done. anything we know dude we know. also here's the other thing. if you're gonna put it on facebook. for your friends and your family. that's cool people probably give a [ __ ] about that. but when somebody post some [ __ ] about their mom. like dude if you were like sorry. i love my mom then love your [ __ ] mom love your mom that's not what you're doing. when you post an instagram. post about you and your mom. and about how she shaped. you to be the person. you are egotistical you. making it bout chill. and i got one question. for you you doin you. do it as a matter. of fact let me shorten the question. for you chu doon ch. you do you any chu dude. you're doing it you're making it. about you it's not about. your mom it's about you. you [ __ ] dumb and people are like saw what they write maybe they don't care if most people don't care. maybe they just want to. share the love they have with another. family or close friends to. who can all access and see the content. i don't man i don't know. man why should it matter. what someone else posts on their personal. social media accounts hey it's it's you're it's not really a personal social. media account what that's a [ __ ] oxymoron social media. is social media. it's none personal about it see. ya also it's one of things that you do oh this is the best one when people write every time. i post something on twitter somebody. tweets me who hurt. you shut up oh you're so [ __ ] original huh. oh i mean everybody. [ __ ] or that's what you just heard somebody do that nyira who hurt. you no matter what a comedian. writes who hurt you will. be like what's the deal. with cellphones who hurt. you hey how come [ __ ] what's going on in the government oh hurt. you get out of here. with the who hurt you. [ __ ] that's almost as a north that's that's one of those that's up there with how annoying it is you know what the who knew who hurt. you is for me. chewed d'un chewed on the [ __ ] out of here. dude what are you doing. you're you are mmm i would venture to. say anyone with a long. post on a mother's day. thing or a father's day. thing he is is a really broken. person that that not know maybe not really. but is a broken person that's had a lot. of heartache and as a matter of fact. who hurt you dude. that you got to. post some [ __ ] on instagram about your mom and about how much you love your mommy. you love how much. you love your mommy. go tell your mommy you love her. don't post it on instagram. ship most mommies don't even have that [ __ ] but that [ __ ] robbed me up. cuz people were like oh you know why. don't you just let them. yeah i know man well i'm not. stalling do what you want. but come on dude. act accordingly these [ __ ] lunatics they're lunatics dude. they're [ __ ] lunatics if you post about your mom on mother's day you're a [ __ ] basically a lunatic is what i'm saying you're a [ __ ] you get a straitjacket tie your hands behind your [ __ ] how many how many music videos are there where the lead singer. is in a straitjacket because they think it's like i'm crazy. that man at all i can't. get you out of my hand. how many music. videos are over there where the [ __ ] band members. are in strange straitjackets. i want to. do a special within a straitjacket and just have the microphone. standing in and then i wouldn't be. able to do it. and they break out in the middle. you know i mean dude. i'm just gonna say some artists. that definitely have some straightjacket. videos britney spears definitely in sync. no doubt oh probably no doubt. i just said no down didn't. mean the band no doubt. but definitely no doubt. you know who definitely has it. like a band like digg or like or like what's that. what what's that one. oh the band fuel for sure. has one oh you know. who definitely has one. who's that what's that's what's that. [ __ ] band matchbox twenty oh they definitely got one mm no there's no question i mean i mean i mean i i think i'm thinking of one that he does oh for sure a lot of women do it with also the the eyeliner being dripping down their [ __ ] cheeks. like they got like that's so stupid. right because like if you have the straitjacket on you're not you don't have makeup. who applied the makeup. who [ __ ] applied the makeup. you did it no your hands. are behind your [ __ ] backs who applied it the [ __ ] doctor the nurse. giving you your medication. she's trying to make it. look pretty for what another. girl that's [ __ ] herself in your cell no. dude keep it 100. dude you in a straitjacket you don't. have makeup on so nothing's. [ __ ] tiered this is the [ __ ] this is the platform that i want to. run on for real and people are like oh you're just being silly you're not talking these are the real issues. in the world man if you're doing a music video in a straitjacket take the [ __ ] makeup off and that's the important.

bbq what a what a [ __ ] dunkin donut dude this [ __ ] idiot first of all why does she kind of looks like an you know what she looks like somebody who is like she actually looks like a canadian. for real she also looks like someone who's like real. far up north and she's true. this [ __ ] little [ __ ] she goes to. call the people on a bbq because they're using a gas grill. black people and she was like you can't be doing this. and it's obviously because they're black people that she's doing. this because she's just being racist. and and she and the cops came. and then she started playing the victim. that's that's like exactly what's wrong. with it's so funny too because that's like you. think that she's conservative. but then you're like oh but that's what a liberal. does also they [ __ ] cry and play the victim. and then oh it's like it least stand. up to it if you're gonna be racist. at least stand up to. it you [ __ ] [ __ ] but also she couldn't claim to. not be racist claim to. be look i actually it has nothing to. do with them being black put out [ __ ] dude put out a video that says it has nothing to. do with them being black i don't like gas. they're not allowed it cost. the city money no i love my park. maybe then we would be like alright this lady's just insane. she doesn't want gas grills and it she takes. a cost of city. money i don't care if they're white.

juan fires [ __ ] up so hard brought up the woman calls police on black family again. he's in the past dude. i'm just gonna type it here. look at 65,000 text. i just here we go. there we go the wait. what she says oh oh she keeps coming. so hard all right with the ads. oh that's what you an online. dating service for millionaire. matchmaking court records say ad has sent the victim. sixty five thousand text. messages including threats to. kill him where his body. parts and bathe in his blood. oh is this a sudden. text messages into specifics. she did however regret the nature. of some of those oh my god your blood. i want to. bathe in it i'd wear your skull. she wrote perfect oh trump. nobody's ever been more sorry. i'm the motive even though. he never apologized but he's always the most. everything nobody's ever been more. sorry i sent him a bad. told him i wanted. to bait in his book. hmm nobody would ever be more sorry. than me a really actually so sad. though if you think about it. in a non comedy way. like he'll be that's a solid. and her if he grew up. to be 20. years old and dated her and then they had a kid. the kid would come out. and be thanos i saw infinity war by the way josh brolin did you see it yeah so let me just say right. out it was i loved it. okay josh brolin was the first and this is not a knock on the other bad. guys on it he was the first. bad guy in any comic book. marvel i'll say dc in the last. few years that was actually creepy. and scary i thought like he actually. was like not like i was like oh but like you know i'm a grown man. but i was like wow that's actually creepy. i was like that that i felt what it. would be like to. be scared of that guy. that's what it was and i was like wow. he was so good and and i hate when people are like when first of all he played like like saw the justice league also with the [ __ ] steppenwolf isn't it a band by the way. like don't you know. the band transcends the [ __ ] like oh no here come step. and steppenwolf they're like pain. on and down and now praying oh they're gonna take over. the world but i now brown. no clue what they sing. because i would never listen. to a band named steppenwolf. but they're probably great i'm an idiot and an ignoramus but i know. they're huge and way. bigger than me well. anyway so so they [ __ ] play so they talk about oh yeah so thinner so so josh brolin. was great really really really good. in that movie and the movie was good. the tone was great. it's just it just totally was you know. look if you don't like marvel movies. you're not gonna like it. i do and and i liked it. a lot it was the best. one in a long time. and i was like how the [ __ ] are they gonna there's so many characters in it how are they gonna do it and they did it they did it well and and the bad guy was really good and it was just good if they did it they did it well and i liked the movie infinity wars. was good now they made justice league as well. now that was before. infinity wars they made it but they oh both were the they both were in development. at the same time okay. i should preface what i'm about. to say as that. and they also are both comic books. that have been around forever. these fight these superheroes and everybody. they've all been around for a long. time they've been around for for a hundred years. almost right not quite but so but i mean superman's. old you know so so superman batman. all those guys captain america. now i watched infinity wars. first then i watched the justice league because i liked the movies i didn't see justice league movie the movie theater. infinity let me start with infinity wars even though it came out afterwards if infinity wars is about i'm not gonna ruin these move i'm not gonna ruin these moves for you if you see them but the plot i'm gonna give it fitty wars is about this guy thanos who wants to who thinks there's too many mouths to feed in the in the in in the world we we all our resources our being used up he wants to half the population he wants to start kind of basically start over and half the population so there's less mouths to feed and the people who will live will now live with full bellies okay so he has to get the infinity stones to do this all right now there's six of them or five five or six i don't know if the thumb has one but anyway so he has to go find these infinity starts he had a glove made by the guy from [ __ ] game game of thrones the small guy and it's disrespectful to call him that and he has to go to different parts of the world and other worlds to get these infinity stones now all these infinity stones are different they they they they do different things one is the time infinity stone the other one is the soul stone the other one is that you know the [ __ ] reality stone and they all control different things the mind stone the the power stone and the space stone okay it's based on now there are green orange red [ __ ] another color purple and blue all right yellow and and they and they put the he had a glove made that he can wear put all these infinity stones in them there's six of them and when he gets all of them he can just snap he can snap and half of the population never existed they don't die but they just never existed and they go away all right the avengers now have to stop him and some of them are in charged of different stones like doctor strange knows where the time stone is so it's like oh it's it's in his chest right so so thanos has to go to him to get this thing and then he has to go somewhere else where some other guy is guarding it and it's [ __ ] thor because it's on ass guard or some [ __ ] i mean i don't even know how i know all these things about this know about at supreme dorka anyway and. the soul stone is like what's the [ __ ] the guardians of the galaxy. are fighting for this. one and so it was clever how they do it. they to go to. each this is how they involve all. the superheroes and all the [ __ ] and so i watched the movie i'm not gonna tell you what happens. at the end but he's you know. he gets a lot of the stones and you're like oh oh what's gonna happen. right oh no so so now i watched. the the justice league and i go to. watch it jessilee how you guys seen the justice league okay. this is what the ivan. gets rid of and one fire. i have not i'm gonna explain. to justice league to. these guys okay batman. alright is it wants to. get a team together alright because there's of the [ __ ] there's this guy steppenwolf alright that wants to. start the world over from scratch. and destroy the world alright now stepping world comes to. earth because on earth. there are three mother boxes. alright the mother boxes are in different. areas of the world and steppenwolf. has to get them. and find where they are. the mother boxes are yellow. red and green or some [ __ ] and with all of these mother. boxes only then will steppenwolf be able. to start the world. over and destroy earth here's my review for both of those movies together hey it's this same movie what's the difference between hair and hair nothing free conch you can make any move you want but dude and and they didn't rip each other off it's not like it's just it this is the formula for these movies every [ __ ] movie that they come with on these superhero movies it's like oh i got a first of all it started off with just one guy because but then you know you need to. keep making it more. and more and more till there's 45. characters and now it's [ __ ] the infinity stones and the mother box it so and it's like oh no this bat all the movies i did a good guy i've got the power the bad guy oh i got a guy i'm here now and i'm taking that thing from you and they take the thing and then the good guys got to. get it back that's that's every [ __ ] movie okay oh in in one way or another oh [ __ ] they killed my dad oh that's my power you know even even as basic as that oh now i got to. get that power back and best. this okay fine whatever. i get i'm not complaining about movies. i love them i love. those movies but then it became i gotta build a team. you know and we got to. get the best of the best. we got to go. all sorts we got to. go so far to. get some of these guys and then somebody else is there. and like he's not gonna want to. do it and then he's like well we're just gonna have to. make him he doesn't want the world. to end either does. he and then they'll be like all right. i'll help ya but grudgingly always everybody's. but grudgingly in this. movie in these movies then they go find the one. of the guys hey and then that guys. always like either he either says i didn't know you existed. or i haven't seen you in a hundred years. and then he's like well you know. i'd only come back if i needed yeah. and then the other guy's like but grudgingly. and he's like need you on my team. then the guys like sorry. things just haven't been the same. since died who ever you know. yeah i know but if you don't come. with me then everyone's gonna die. and he's like nah not joining. your team no matter what and then he's like well. let me
