we're living in right. now if you're watching this podcast. because um what it is. is we are doing this. podcast because i feel okay. because i got vaccinated. um early on today but there is a countdown. here where at any moment. i could just start feeling the effects. of the vex of the vaccination. and i can break out. into a cold sweat and get headaches. and i don't have them. yet but by the end of this. episode i may be [ __ ] so you're with me. in real time it's like that. movie that johnny depp movie. nick of time is what it. is and is that movie bad. yes have i ever seen it. no how do i know. it's bad because okay because it was called. nick of time and johnny. depp was the lead and and i guarantee. you this is just something i thought of right. now i guarantee you his his uh his name in the movie. is nick i guarantee you. and that's [ __ ] horrible okay um i so anyway it's called nick of time and it's and the whole. movie takes place an hour. and however many minutes and the whole movie. goes it was like the first 24. tv show 24 but in in the movie. time and when johnny. depp was doing an interview. he was like well the really cool. thing about this movie. is that uh every every minute. is true to them. to them you know and uh anyway. i left these four water bottles. to let you know your boy's hydrating uh and he's doing it. because supposedly that makes it so the vaccine. doesn't uh affect you and now. that i'm saying it out. loud i actually realized that that is absolute horseshit. but um i am drinking. a lot of water. i've drank and i've drank and i've drunk and i've drawn i never knew. that test the the tents of that. and i never will and i'm only 41. so i could still learn. it but uh i'm drinking. water anyway and i drank and i've drank and i've drank a lot. of water so i drank a lot. of water i think that's what it. is and um so yeah uh so who knows when i'm gonna get [ __ ] cold shivers. maybe i won't and that'll be fine. but yeah dude we're doing it. we're doing a podcast uh and uh that's cool. man that's pretty [ __ ] cool dude. um i don't know where we should start. uh but we can start. with um i got my yeah i got my second vacation. i already did that so i got my second vaccine. and my arm hurts and i i didn't work. out i was gonna i was gonna [ __ ] race home and work out and [ __ ] do it and uh i didn't and i didn't do that and tmz tried to. come up to. me today and say hey chris what do you think what do. you think and i go like this. you think i'm going to. talk to you guys in my car. and [music] dude um yeah man and i did. it and i did it. you know what dude. when i really think about it. um i want to. i want to. uh say something and uh i want to. make sure that i'm not offending this person. because i secretly think he's great. but i'm not telling you. guys that but the actor who plays. sawyer on lost should have his hair. short always and that's it. and that's it dude. and that's it he should have his hair. short always and he is a guy who should never have long hair. and that's it dude. no i don't make the rules. i'm the vessel for the rules. to swoop on through. me and they shoot. out my mouth and they tell you guys like a preacher. does with jesus but i am. not religious and i am not a preacher. but these rules these. rules that come into. my they honestly i think they enter through. my anus and they come in and they move through. my intestines and they come up. through my esophagus and they fire. out to let you guys know the guy who played sawyer and lost should have short hair. always because he looks much. better in that [ __ ] new show. whatever he's doing with the girl. from uh walking dead i don't ever. know a show's name i only know the actors in it. were in something else that's how it is from now. on i think that's what being in your 40s. is like yeah it's the show. with the girl from walking dead. you mean colony i don't know. it's to show with the guy. from lost we used to. have the long hair. colony i don't [ __ ] know so he should have. short hair and that's that. and i figured that. out and that's all good and um so you're welcome. for that and uh i'm always here for the hardhitting issues. josh holloway that's what it. is ah yes dude josh holloway is uh he's cool. dude i bet that guy's nice as [ __ ] i bet. he's nice as [ __ ] he i never heard one. story about that guy but i bet. he's one of those guys. one of those actors where people have stories and they're like dude. you know josh uh holloway gave um uh who would it. be giovanni rabisi when he was uh coming up. josh holloway gave giovanni robisi his shoes. and josh holloway walked home uh and it was like three miles or something like that. because joshua holloway walks a lot. speaking of which dude have i ever talked about this who's that guy thomas jane that's yeah i know i've talked about him i saw him once on an event with [ __ ] no shoes or socks on oh gonna [ __ ] step on a syringe dude he got out confident and as all get out which was i like that but also wear shoes and socks because they're cities now you know what i mean wear shoes and socks because they're cities now and it's not like we all live [ __ ] in tribes. here in la but he um he did. that and in a way. he was my hero. and my enemy at the same. time because i'm jealous of a guy. who does that but also hey guy. wear shoes and socks um one time i got out of jujitsu when i was [ __ ] i was must have been 24 yeah and i got out of jiu jitsu and i didn't have my shoes on and i walked to. my dude this is how [ __ ] crazy i am i walked to. my car as i was working. in my car i stepped on something. and it stung me. and i was like oh [ __ ] but i kept walking i kept walking got in the car. drove all the way from wilshire. boulevard to burbank. now for those of you that. don't live in la [ __ ] you you don't get to. know how long that is all. right it's 40 35 minutes. i'll tell you and so um i got back. to burbank and i hung out. for a little bit and then i started thinking about how i hurt. my foot and i was like wait. a second i just assumed that. it was a bee but what if it was a syringe. and i thought nah it's not because i would have known. i would have stepped on the whole. needle it would have been fine. whatever let the [ __ ] thought get buried. for a little bit then my ocd. goes like this [music] and i'm like [music]. who is it and they're like it's your ocd. and i'm like i'm sleeping i'm just going. to go back to. bed and my ocd's like all. right and i'm like okay. and then my ocd oh my god damn it. give [ __ ] just see what the [ __ ] they want walk over hey hey yeah it's me again no i know what's up hey um you know how you said you thought that uh maybe it was uh it wasn't a syringe it was a syringe but then you realized it probably wasn't because you would have felt the whole. mechanism and yeah i remember yeah well what if um just the needle. came off and it was on the ground. and the mechanism wasn't attached. to it um you can still. get tuberculosis that way. anyway we just wanted to. drop by and throw that thought up. in your [ __ ] bitchass head but but go to. bed go go back to. bed okay i guess i'll drive back. my ocd left the door. open because they knew i was gonna [ __ ] drive back so i [ __ ] drove back from burbank to. [ __ ] wilshire boulevard another. 35 minutes drove all the way. back dude got out of the car. and when i got out. of the car i thought what the [ __ ] am. i even looking for a dead. bee i don't even know where i stepped really i just walked you're not. thinking about where you're stepping. so i'm [ __ ] tracing my moves. back all clean because i already showered. from after jiu jitsu i looked. like i was i looked like i was ready. for it i looked like a guy that. was [ __ ] looking for an ant sized date he lost. just what the [ __ ] and i'm looking on the ground. like an [ __ ] dude like my date was honey. i shrunk the kids and i'm just looking and i look and i look i'm like i'm never gonna find. this [ __ ] and sure enough dude i [ __ ] you not i look and there is a bee belly. up dude there is a bee belly. up outside of jean. of john machado's [ __ ] wilshire boulevard. old [ __ ] dojo or whatever the [ __ ] and i found it and my oc and i and when i get i drive all the way back home. happy as [ __ ] and i get back into. my apartment and i get go. to bed and i [ __ ] my ocd i i checking with my ocd. and my ocd is like hey i'm just here. to help and then my ocd. put its hat on and [ __ ] drove away man i drove all the way back to. make sure it wasn't a syringe. when i knew it. wasn't a syringe but my ocd. didn't know it wasn't a syringe. god ocd is sucks it's part. of the reason i'm so [ __ ] up um so anyway dude i i can't believe a snapple bottle remember when the [ __ ] bitchass uh commercial was in snapple and the guy would be like it's all mine that really buff guy at the end it's all mine he'd say and you'd he'd be holding the snapple and he'd say it's all mine and and and they and it was like why did they cast that [ __ ] guy with no nuts it's all mine wow i wonder if i could find that i bet i could actually i'm gonna look for it if we don't if i can't find it i'm gonna cut i'm gonna i'm gonna cut this part out but here we go i'm gonna go to. youtube youtube snapple it's all. mine that's what i'm gonna [ __ ] man. the internet is amazing. huh uh when it's on your side. um snapple it's all all mine here. we go snapple it's all. mine commercial i gotta write commercial. here we go snapple it's all. mine commercial [ __ ] got it all right. cool we got it we got it. guys [ __ ] ivan get rid of found it. oh this is it dude. wow i was a year off it's 1994. this. is it nobody's going to. think this is funny but me bodybuilder. from california rice nothing tastes. better than a snapple after an intense. workout teddy you lift it. you keep it no doubt. this guy's dead by now for real this. is a guy who would be dead. now i love how he doesn't say [ __ ] and lifts it. up made from the best. stuff on earth it's all mine. oh he was right.

snap. snapple teddy snapple commercial um age nothing. even close to. came up okay it's fine. nothing even close to. came up and it's all good. i sometimes i google the wrong. things um sometimes i go go the wrong. things and that's not my fault. i just try to. do what i do and that's it. uh [music] but this kid. this is a joke. right come on she just sent me. a a a a sister video to. this um hold on a second. hold on a second why why is this. turned off the opposite the opposite. way oh oh i guess it's not showing that. okay um here we go. four i have produced three. fulllength bodybuilding documentaries and a half. dozen contest videos i'm mike posanella and during that test to. win dawn by the crowd 1. 30 she wants me to. see this oh what is this. steve clearly had no concept of the prerequisites. of a bodybuilding contest come. on this isn't real shaved had. no tan and frankly. no muscles look the way. he's doing i began to. realize that steve may. not be completely in touch. with reality is this [ __ ] actually the secret is i'm a leader. not a follower oh this. is real dude you know. immediately when someone is serious. and immediately when they're [ __ ] wrong when they're when they're not when they're making a joke. and you can tell number one. that this guy's serious. because of the way he's talking number. two he's in an adidas track. suit and those guys never joke. i am telling you right. now there has never been a [ __ ] guy in an adidas track shoot that has been joking think about it. think about all the persons. and all the armenians that. dress in the adidas tractors when are they joking. dude when are they joking. they're serious all the time. dude persians armenians are. serious all the [ __ ] time dude. you ever see them. get out of a car. are they joking then no. they're just like what i got out. of this car i don't where's the [ __ ] place. i don't make the rules. impress me now they have those eyes. you know what i mean. we're just like what what what unless. it's like after 11 p.m and then they really get [ __ ] lit. dude they're just like but before 11. p.m they're just like hey hey don't hey don't [ __ ] around. don't touch a don't touch my face. i don't like when people touch my face. even when we're joking around. but after 11 they'll be like hey how about how he got all [ __ ] paranoid when i touched his face oh it's a little mexican whatever do it hey for serious how come when i how come when i touched his face he got like a [ __ ] and then everyone's like eat all your food or you'll have an ugly wife you know they'll make up some [ __ ] [ __ ] like that armenians and persians they they make up sayings that don't actually they'll just be like hey hey remember eat all your food or you'll have an ugly wife dude so this guy's doing that and that so the reason why you know he's serious is cause first of all he's talking and it's serious and it's very obvious. and second of all he's in an adidas. track suit and third of all. his name is mike. pulcinella mike personella and no one can really tell you what's going. to accept yourself and no one knows your diet. and your training routine. better than yourself because i tried. clearing my body and also that if i train more now time. of the day i'm over. training that point i'm hurting myself and i'm burning. myself out but you understand one. thing what's really going. on in the sport itself. bodybuilding not bodybuilding bodybuilders are the scientific. itself bodybuilding is this what this. guy what one thing was really going. on in the sport itself. bodybuilding not bodybuilding bodybuilders is the scientific. itself bodybuilding is a science in itself. okay it's a whole big. thing a testosterone oh no dude. that's it when somebody says it's a whole big. thing you know they're selling. snake oil like you know it's a whole big thing. they don't you know. they don't know what the [ __ ] they're talking about. uh it's all big the thing. i i guess i see where i confuse you. it's a whole big thing. i'm out dude i'm already out. it's a whole big thing. this is distracting the [ __ ] out. of me sorry it's distracting. this [ __ ] out of me. it's just showing you that it's like flipping. around and [ __ ] so everything's all [ __ ] up dude how about that when i do it how about that when i do it i'm going to. do a bodybuilding i if dude. if i entered a bodybuilder i used to. do that when i was a kid. i would go into. my parents house and a house. like i slept outside i slept. in a tree house no i would go to. my parents bedroom and i would do i would do posing for them like i was a bodybuilder. so lanky and i will wait. for my parents to. laugh and then i will go to. bed i try to. win them over um so what's this. guy talking about throughout the day. steve recited this same speech. to anyone good stunned enough. to listen good good good good that's good. i don't like shopping my body either. way i think that's when the work you do in the sport. you're not shocking your body. i think it's so dangerous. i love this it's very dangerous. it is dangerous bodybuilding is. dangerous and he's like the diet's dangerous. and i agree with this. guy and this guy has the best body. i've ever seen because of that. because of his attitude. not because of his body he has the best. buddy i've ever seen because of his attitude. and i love that. [ __ ] that is amazing. uh okay cool good well. we figured that out. this guy's my favorite bodybuilder. um [music] that that was what i wanted. to say about bodybuilding what was i even [ __ ] talking about the other thing dude how funny are like wait let me turn off this [ __ ] how funny are like guys you know what i'm talking about like i don't mean they mean to. be funny i mean how funny. are guys when they're just together. and they're just they don't know. they're being funny and they're just [ __ ] talking and you're like guys shut the [ __ ] up you know what i'm talking about dude. guys are [ __ ] hilarious when they get together it's like when girls get together you're like i don't know what you're talking about but when guys get together you're like oh you guys are just getting [ __ ] dumber like one guy is not dumb guys are dumb the more guys together the more dumb they are you get two guys together you're like uh we got to. split them up so they don't make dumb. decisions you know what i'm talking. about you know you know you know. when you're like you're in high school. and your mom's like we don't you. shouldn't be hanging out with those. boys it's cause together. you're guys and you're gonna do dumb.

[ __ ] said anything look first why are they micked dude. why are they miked. what the [ __ ] are they doing miking. baseball managers and umpires [ __ ] work on your [ __ ] shoulder [ __ ] [ __ ] no god damn it you've had a horse [ __ ] zone all day also not a [ __ ] major league baseball game don't get that mad you don't have much riding on it hey you're not the brewers you're the [ __ ] horn you know horn hornets. or some [ __ ] you know that's not a you're the [ __ ] golden grizzlies or some [ __ ] what'd he say to. you what'd he say. he never even looked at. you he never even of course his. name is wally is there a more baseball name than wally oh this. is [ __ ] wally backman wow i know a lot of 80s. and 90s baseball players. and i was going to. say of course his name. is wally like wally backman and this. is wally backman dude. wally bachman is the most baseballiest baseball. guy of all time tied with wade. boggs wally bachmann wade boggs and ken camanetti the three most baseballiest baseball. guys with the baseball names. that you can [ __ ] look like look look at them. all look at what look. at wade boggs wally bachman and look at ken cameneti they're basically. all the same guy. and if you add them. all up they equal keith. hernandez that's all i'm saying dude. they're the most baseballiest baseball guys. and he's dirtying up the home. plate no this a child because that means the ump. have to [ __ ] undo it and clean it [ __ ] i never said a goddamn word to. the guy you know. it yeah you know. it oh gas lighting love. it i do it you know. it and you know it. and you know it. well here's something that you know. that's a great way. to start a a [ __ ] a point in an argument or here's something that you know i didn't do that. yeah dude gaslight city [ __ ] yeah dude i could be a good baseball manager. because gaslight city dude. with a gaslight city with a gaslight. city golden grizzlies here to. play and he here we go. wally bachman always getting a little pissed. off i never said a goddamn word. to the guy you know. it and that's where they get their name. folks no this is [ __ ] i never said a goddamn word to. the guy you know. it yep yeah and the guy just goes like this. you're right i i do know. it what did you think it. was gonna be like a [ __ ] jedi move i love that. [ __ ] dude you know it when you point at somebody you really get your point across no pun intended i didn't mean it like that know what let's go okay all right. let's go wait hold. on i love [ __ ] like this and i will tell you why because how long can you be this. mad that's that's the best part. to me because already he's been mad. this mad at this level. for a minute that is really hard. okay like it's a difficult. thing to do like it's like fighting. have you ever gotten to. a fight or like trained hard. in a in a boxing situation. or a jujitsu or a judo. or a grappling kind of situation. fighting for a minute is like. it's honestly it's like fighting. for an hour it's just it's just hard. the whole time 20. seconds after 20 seconds of fighting. you're just like should i give up. and die do you know. what i mean so if you're arguing. this long there's the point. in the argument or in the arguing. that you know you can't. sustain it you're at the top. level of heat and you know you can't sustain. it but especially if you're a man. or if you're a woman that had a horrible. childhood you know you can't. let up because your ego. kicks in because if you show. you're not that angry the whole. time then you were never really that. angry right yes and you know. it so here is the mark where i notice. wally backman is kind of understanding. okay i hit hot heat. for a minute how do i sustain. this so like any good fighter. he takes a breather he has his hands on his hips now and he's just kind of chilling. i can't wait to. see what he says because i know it's going. to be a little bit different. i don't know let's go. i want to. know what i said oh dude. he's right he's right. about so much in this episode. of the podcast it's like he's [ __ ] ringo starr dude. you know what i just want. to i just want to. ask dude one time i was cooking. something in a microwave. when i was in high school. and i opened up the microwave. to get the food. and i it wasn't hot. enough so i closed. the microwave door and my brother. all of a sudden was right. here i opened the microwave. door my brother wasn't there. and in the time i touched. the food to see if it. was hot enough decided it wasn't hot. enough and needed to. put it in for another. 30 seconds and close that microwave. door my brother like the [ __ ] roadrunner now i didn't look at him because you know why because [ __ ] my brother you understand when you're in high school and your younger brother walks into. the room you only look at him. if you're a [ __ ] but i was the man so i didn't look at him. my brother sensed this and he obviously wanted. to say something to. me so he said hey chris and i swallowed my pride and i turned and looked at my brother. and that was when i realized his hand. was like this and when i turned my nose hit. his [ __ ] pointed finger now. there's two things i want to. tell you about this. number one that's [ __ ] annoying that he got me. and number two it hurt. way more than you. could imagine my brother knew this. because he saw the look on my face. and i was very angry. so my brother ran really fast. away from me i ran after him. he got through the front door. and i slipped and i fell on. the ground and i really [ __ ] hurt. myself so not only did i have a [ __ ] up nose from the point from the pink finger. pink finger pointing i also hurt. the side of my hip because i fell on. the ground all right. now that made me mach. 11 mad congratulations nice to. meet you mach11 mad well come on in we'll just be hanging out for a little bit where would you like to. hang out on my side. and my nose sounds great i couldn't catch my brother. because i had fell down. and my brother slowed down. and just kind of looked over. and he goes now i'm mock. 12 mad because he's laughing. at my pain that he caused. and that he caused so i realized i can't catch him. i'm in pain he got a good. lead start now really good restart. so i go like this. hey man come here i just want. to talk to. you and i thought that was gonna work. but when he walked over. to me i was gonna beat the [ __ ] out of him. and he didn't walk over. to me but my point. is you gotta switch. when you're mad sometimes because you can't. sustain the harder you are mad. the quicker the fall is right. the sooner you want to. tap out so that's where this dude. is at this moment. right here he didn't. get finger pointed and fall down. but he's that mad you. know it and now he just switches. gears i want to. know what i said i'm going. to ask him what i said. wow wow because he knows what he said because he's him. but he wants the other guy. excuse me what i said. in your report take your report and shove it. up your [ __ ] see dude he didn't actually want to. know what he thought he said a man. dude guys hanging out together on unreal. dude you could take your report you. can shove it up your ass. i ask him what i said. i'm going to ask. him what i said in your report take your report and shove it. up your [ __ ] ass that's some [ __ ] you know the last guy i bumped i had to. knock you on your [ __ ] ass wow. he's getting your [ __ ] report you little [ __ ] pimp squeak
