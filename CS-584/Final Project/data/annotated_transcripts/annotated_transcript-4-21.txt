that you sit back. and you relax and you realize he's gonna skip. the part where he says paul. did my [ __ ] interruption right. but he's growing because this is this. happened after he did this. to me so he's backstage. and there's a [ __ ] hanger on next. to him that's just yes. ending him right this is why they said don't speak on the illuminati. not only is it jesus's. family but it's also your family. no i see the light. that's guiding everybody is like a bad. light sucked on helium but when you have. a good life all you have to. do is call on the illuminaries. and click the channel

got me it got me right here it got me right here oh [ __ ] she believes me and someone else is getting credit for being a nice person when it didn't exist and i was like yep yep yep already in the lie [ __ ] it i was waist deep let's do it i said wow that's so cool later on on the phone i heard my mom say and would you believe what mrs whatever the [ __ ] her name is did i overhear her saying and she gave him like six or seven legos because he was a good boy isn't that so sweet i felt it i felt it right here i was however old i was and i felt it right here i was already [ __ ] tits deep in the lie you know. oh [ __ ] so you know what i did. the next day i quietly went. to school with those legos in my backpack. and i quietly slipped them. back where they belonged i lied. for a day and i made it right. and it never came clean. never told my mommy about that. and i'm saying it right. now on this podcast. now does she listen. to this podcast no but you guys. are [ __ ] and you'll probably find her online. and dm her that. i stole legos once when i was six so that's it. i only stole that and a hat once. from bright aid and it was green. neon green and white and those are the only things. i stole and i returned one. and the green hat i stole because i thought if i put it on my head. and walk out and the cashier. doesn't say [ __ ] then i deserve it. and i still kind of think that actually. it was like 11 but i looked him. right in the eyes and they said anything else and i said nope. what the [ __ ] it is it was [ __ ] like before monster energy drinks but it looked like that it was like a green and white zebra hat like neon green and i looked him with that [ __ ] hat on and i said nope that'll be all and he said all right and i walked out with that hat on i stole it those are the two things i sold i'm one of them [ __ ] man i want to. talk about the funniest [ __ ] all right. there are a few videos. online i don't know if i'm going. to laugh at this. like i did when i first saw this. there are a few videos. online that make me laugh. so hard that i just can't do you know. what i mean i it's a good. thing i was laying down in bed. because i would have just crumpled. it got me so good. i posted it on my story and it's i think it's from that. t hank's profile which is so funny. man t dot hanks. and uh on instagram and i post it. and i post on my story and this [ __ ] [ __ ] dude this made me laugh so much here we go i'm gonna play it what the [ __ ] with the lights. chocolate croissant you only get one. so take okay one you want to. eat two that's good now. you put your bologna finger. on it i like this. one no it's just a croissant. with chocolate chips in it. why the [ __ ] are you touching them all i like this. one better they're all. the same no they're not we'll get [laughter]. bro when he when he oh this. is so funny okay when he hold on. what the [ __ ] with the lights. dude first of all he comes in so hot. already dude i didn't realize how he came in until i watched. it about six times he comes. in he goes and he's already what the [ __ ] with the lights. just so mad already like it's like it's probably. his fault he's probably hitting the wrong. oh [ __ ] dude okay and he comes in with a gift. for like his daughters you know. they look like they're in college. but he brings a a [ __ ] and he says he thinks he's super dad you know what i mean and he said he wants so much credit when he says when he says [laughter] what he said croissants. dude he wants so much. credit and he he's so he can't help. how mad he is about the lights. you know but he went in with an idea of oh i'm gonna make my daughter's. day you know what i mean. and so he's quickly swallows. the anger about the lights. and says chocolate croissants right. okay dude so that i love. that already so okay. so so here we go. okay dude so then he opens it up. dude by the way it's already opened like he already had one. you know [music] one. of the doctors going mmm and he opens it up. you know you can't open up. those kirkland [ __ ] cellophane bullshits without being so [ __ ] because they're always so stuck together you know like chocolate croissants. right and dude and it has to. go his way do you know what i mean. that's my favorite part about. this it has to. go his way he needs to. be dulling him out right. he wants to. save some for later whatever. he's got in his head. it's deteriorating right now he got through. the first what the [ __ ] is wrong. with the lights happy. got through it and then his daughters just deteriorate him. with their actions dude. and it's amazing dude it's you only get one so take one dude. i'm making a rule already. first of all there's [ __ ] nine okay there's literally oh i actually think there's 12 in here okay i can't really see but i think there's 12 chocolate croissants. and i only get one so dude. already set a rule there's 12. of them you only get one. so just like i hate to. break it to. you but like chocolate croissants. but also you only get one. okay so that's amazing. right that he's setting the rule. and then immediately daughter comes. in scoops up two. with one hand all right. now i can feel this. guy's energy dude. and the [ __ ] goes back to. them what the [ __ ] is up with the lights. but twofold right because he already swallowed that. he probably feels like he was like being a good person. by letting the light thing slide so now she's taking two. and i just said take one. and she jumped on it. too quickly i get this. dude i get him man. okay two you want to. eat two that's good dude. okay two you won't eat two. that's good like fuming dude. fuming to say okay. good good two get okay. i said one but you get you. got to you won't eat two. good dude fuming i gotta we gotta start. it over dude this is the great. [ __ ] you if you don't like that i'm breaking. this video down and you wish i was doing something else on. this podcast no this is important. this this is what we need to. be talking about dude. this video is absolutely tragically. unbelievable okay let's start. from the beginning again. yes with the lights. chocolate croissants you only. get one so take one okay two you won't eat. two that's good now you put your baloney finger. on it what does he mean. this is so off the rails. i don't even know what he. means by baloney figure there's two. things that he might mean. and each of them are better. than the other one. all right there's two things. he might mean all right. now he either means your fingers look. like baloney which is so shitty. for a dad to. say all right or i think i like this. one better dude i think i like this. one better dude they ate baloney. before this and he doesn't want the taste. of baloney on his croissants. he might eat later. dude i hope it's that. dude this is the greatest all right. dude let's start it. over man [ __ ] off what the [ __ ] is wrong with the lights. dude he's so bad they're just watching a show. you know they're just watching a show. this guy comes in like a [ __ ] hurricane dude. and with chocolate like a chocolate casserole. hurricane dude holy [ __ ] [ __ ] man oh [ __ ] you guys started over we gotta watch the whole. thing through dude what the [ __ ] with the lights. chocolate croissants you only. get one so take one okay two you want. to eat two that's good. now you put your baloney finger. on it i like this. one no it's just a croissant. with chocolate chips in it. why the [ __ ] are you touching them all right. i like this one better. they're all the same no they're not we'll get it. [ __ ] off he says [ __ ] up he says [ __ ] up because the daughter. [ __ ] touched more than she should have. been take some plea this. guy dude i'm watching this. in the bed the first you think i'm leaving. hard now the first time i saw this. i was crying dude. tears were coming up i was rolling. and rolling around. and kristen said she said i was laughing. so much dude i laughed myself. to sleep the next morning. she woke up to. the bed shaking because i was thinking. about it's not a joke. dude she woke up because the bed. was shaking because i was [ __ ] woke up. thinking well you got your balance. [music] dude okay so so [ __ ] [ __ ] man but when i was watching it she says you know what you think this is so funny and i said why and she said because he is you dude and it made so much sense because i agree with this guy i agree that this guy got the chocolate croissants and he needed it should have went his way he was nice enough to. bring the [ __ ] chocolate croissants. in for his [ __ ] family and they were touching them all and doing them. how he didn't want to. they ate baloney beforehand and made. the [ __ ] chocolate flavor baloney shits. and the lights didn't work this. guy was being so nice bringing his family. 12 croissants and his daughter. came in just like they're touching them. all with bologna fingers dude. [ __ ] up the lights. and he pays the light. bill but in that something man. that's just how life is. i thought about this clip. a lot after this i thought about this. clip a lot after this and that's just how life is you think you walk. into a room whatever that room. is and you got the [ __ ] chunk. of croissants and the people in there. they don't give a [ __ ] about how you feel about your chocolate. croissants you know when you start a conversation. with somebody and you're in the car. and you're like when i see this. [ __ ] i'm gonna say this and then they're gonna say this and then i'm gonna say that to. that and then you get there. and you're like hey i gotta talk. to you about something and they're on the phone. and they're like hold on one. second and you're like okay. well wait this is not something. i prepare for life comes. at ya dude everyone's not going to. feel the same way you do. about your chocolate croissants. and this video is the funniest. that's why this video is. one of the funniest videos. ever because that's what everybody's. doing when they go and they walk into. a party or they walk. into an establishment or they walk. home or they [ __ ] get into. their new car or whatever. the [ __ ] it is you're walking in there with some chocolate. croissants but there are other people in there. and they don't feel that way. about your [ __ ] chocolate croissants. how [ __ ] they want to. put their heads all over the [ __ ] chocolate croissants. and the lights are all [ __ ] up anyway anywhere. when you walk in it. just it doesn't go. the way you think it is and that's it. dude that's all i want to.
