so [ __ ] terrified as a little boy like [ __ ] straight up straight up terrified one time i couldn't spend the night at my friend says i have i had a friend that lived next. door and i couldn't do it matt. trevenna he lived next door. and i would try to. go sleep next door then. i would just be like [ __ ] it eventually. i would just be like going. home and then i just run next. door and go home and knock on the door. my mom when interested. like what's up a bit. i couldn't do her mommy and then she'd be like alright get it. we'll get you sleeping. back tomorrow mmhmm and i hated it. you know i'm 39 now. and yeah i'm still the youngest. guy alive but i was even younger. but could you imagine even. younger at 39 he was. the youngest man alive but could you imagine one day long ago. it was young there anyway um so my mom was like you know it's okay if you try to. it's okay to. be scared she's like don't feel bad about being scared. you can be scared. and it's also okay to. miss sleep just try to. stay over your friends. house even if you're up all night. it's okay and that was her. at her [ __ ] wit's end you know but she was really sweet. for saying that and even as a kid. i knew that she was like like on my side. but also like a little bit fed. up and i was like yeah. but it makes sense i was like i should try. to do that he was like why. don't you just try. to stay over so one day did. i tell you this story about freddy. krueger and chris siegel or whatever i'll do it. again i don't think i have actually to. be honest i don't like i told this. story chris siegel who was one. of the cool kids because he lived on. the other side of town. he was friends with justin mckinnon. and just mackinnon was really cool. too they both like freddy. krueger a lot justin mckinnon. one time had a birthday. party and yet a sleepover. and i wouldn't even go. to the sleepover part. i told my parents to. pick me up at night because they weren't they were gonna watch psycho but before. that they watched the [ __ ] bulls game and michael jordan was playing and any time michael jordan went for a shot or i went for a slam dunk. afterwards justin mckinnon would say. jordan what the soil he would. do it in a highpitched voice. and i even as like a youngster i'd be like why. the [ __ ] is he doing that. in my old man. brain he'd [ __ ] slam dunk and justin mckinnon would go jordan with the slam anyway i left because they were gonna watch psycho and my dad was like a kimbley they're gonna watch psycho the kitchen be watching psycho knows well i could never watch that go if you think psycho scary. i left i went bye. guys and everyone went by. and then justin mckinnon when jordan with the slowed. him and then i [ __ ] went home. one day just a mackinnon's friend. chris segal said hey won't you spend the night. this weekend and i said okay because i thought about what my mom. said i was like you know. what maybe i'll just spend the night. and i'll be awake. all night but who cares. i knew i couldn't get home. because chris siegel lived. in the faraway part of new jersey. like it was like you know 20. minutes away on the other side of town so i knew saying yes and confirming the sleepover would absolutely make it so i would have to. stay over because i couldn't call. my mom at like [ __ ] 1 i am. because she'd be sleeping. she's not gonna come pick me. up then so i got to. chris siegel's house and apparently now that i'm older. i realized my mom told chris. he goes mom look i know she called. ahead i know chris siegel. like fred krueger chris lea. is really

came out from the unrolled. from the unrolled the poster. and and [ __ ] came on and then stabbed us in the heart. as little kids so anyway uh i'm like asking all sorts. of bullies like let's watch action jackson was on i remember with carl weathers. and he was like let's watch this. movie and i was like yeah i was like cool. he's really into. it maybe we'll stay up. so watching the movie and chris segal. ends up falling asleep and now. i'm awake i keep trying. to wake him up. and i do i use all those i used like two. or three times like i can't keep doing. this man he's gonna post. he's gonna tell everybody. in new jersey dude. thank god there's no internet. back then i would have been [ __ ] shamed so um anyway action jackson ends. and i am i am like how do i fall asleep. i'll say i could just wait. till the daylight i'll be good cuz i won't be scared. in the daylight anymore so i am. sitting there watching tv just [ __ ] he has a tv in his room. and i'm just sitting there like imagine me. just up it's [ __ ] 2 a.m. as a tenyearold just looking around. and chris siegel's just sleeping. next to me you know. and i i'm like uh uh uh oh i by the way. i'm scared stiff because i don't. want to go anywhere. else in the house i think freddie's gonna get me. like this is legitimate i'm not making this. up i thought freddie was somewhere in the house. i was a [ __ ] i had a crazy imagination. and i was very scared. so i'm i'm like now now i think oh oh i didn't think about this. but i have to. go to the bathroom. and i can't go anywhere. because i'm too scared. literally like my body won't it. would be very hard to. move my body i'll say and i'm watching the tv. and the grumblings in my tummy. and i gotta go number two. it's not number one i mean. numbered one as well because you have to. go number one if you go number. two but number two was the focus so i'm like man. i'm like looking at if i had a watch. back then i'd be looking at it thinking. like well when's the sun come up. can i hold the poop. until the sun comes up can i home. to poop in my anus. until the scene can the poop stay. inside of my butthole until. the light comes with lights. coming over at 6:10 it's it's great. for hours i polly explode. my pants so no no no i'm gonna have already have to. tick or i'm probably have to. make sure that fred's gonna have to. kill me because it boop's gonna i'm gonna [ __ ] my pants. you know i mean like that's what i would have. been doing it so so um so i'm like [ __ ] what do i do and i decide it must have must be like 3:30. a.m. at this point i decide i can't i can't really take it. anymore i have to. [ __ ] but i'm like i'm gonna have to. make a run for the bath room. and do it because otherwise i'm gonna [ __ ] my pants. and not only am i the [ __ ] but chris siegel. is gonna tell everybody. [ __ ] my pants in his bed so i'm like alright i got to. do this man you got a man. a men up go take a [ __ ] [ __ ] your man dizzily because yeah you're a man dude i know you're nine but your [ __ ] man go take a [ __ ] in that bathroom so i decide to. do it and i'm not bullshitting. you this really happened all right. i'm so [ __ ] tired but i have to. [ __ ] and i'm thinking about getting up to. go to do this. the [ __ ] the tv is on the news. okay the tv cuts. to i don't know if it was a news. segment or what but it. cuts to there was on very low volume no volume. the cuts to. a bedroom this is a new segment. it cuts to. a bedroom and the camera is on the pillow. of the bed the pillows. of the bed and then it it. shows the foot of the bed. outward and then there's a door at the in from the furthest. part of the camera on the wall. and i'm watching this. tv i'm like what the [ __ ] is this because i can't hear it. cuz i don't know what they're talking. about the door opens and not lying. to you i wouldn't believe somebody. if they told me this but it happened. to me so i know it's true. the door opens and it's freddy. krueger and he's got his [ __ ] knife. fingers and he's walking towards the bed. to the camera and i can't. believe my [ __ ] brain i can't believe what i'm looking at i can't believe what's happening. the only thing i'm the most scared. of is freddy krueger and right. when i decide i'm gonna go have to. take a [ __ ] and make a run for it. freddy krueger's all of a sudden in the goddamn room. so now i think whoa i'm gonna [ __ ] in this bedroom not in the bathroom. [ __ ] your world you made me [ __ ] in the bedroom [ __ ] it i'll be known. as the [ __ ] the pants. guy in new jersey i don't give a [ __ ] i had these cutoff remember to. eye these red sweats that i cut off into. shorts and that was what i was gonna [ __ ] in and i was well prepared. to do that i was like guess. i'm just staying here as a nineyearold. alright freddy you got me. and then a cut and it was gone. i don't even know what it. was about maybe was about a freddy. mover company freddy krueger movie coming out. googled it and tried to.
