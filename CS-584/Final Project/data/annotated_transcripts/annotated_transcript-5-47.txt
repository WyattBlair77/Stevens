 oh this is a good. one hanna de vries i actually. think of busy i've thought about this. [ __ ] already you knock on the door. to the bathroom if someone's in there. once that's it because nobody has ever wanted to. hang out in a [ __ ] public. bathroom longer than they've needed. to be so if i'm in there. for and i'm serious 35 minutes i'm [ __ ] my brains out. you don't [ __ ] come on hey stuff is coming out. of my [ __ ] dude find another restroom. or [ __ ] your pants let me be i got here first trust me i don't want this to. be happening more than you don't. want this to be happening. this is funny actually because it kind of it. didn't backfire but this is how someone learns i went. to go lock the door. and i noticed that the lock wasn't really that. much of a good lock if you really tried. you could open the door. but i was like look i'll lock it as long. as it goes if somebody tries. to open it they'll. see it's locked and they're not gonna try. to break it down. cuz they don't work for swat. so i'm there sitting down doing mmm business. and i hear a jiggle. at the door and a knock and i say i'm in here even though i don't need to. cuz the goddamn door was. locked and then i hear the jiggle. again and i'm like well. this [ __ ] gonna make this door open if he really tries to. do that and again. i say hey i don't know. what you want me. to tell you but i'm busy. and i'm in here then it happens. again and i get mad. i get mad because this person isn't understanding that. i'm not throwing my 25th. birthday party in this coffee. bean bathroom with piss all over the floor. so then one last time. they jerked the door and this. is by the way not long. enough they're giving me between. the jiggles and sure enough the lock comes undone oh oh and right. then i go from angry. to zero angry i couldn't be more relaxed. if i were sleeping and i'm common. [ __ ] dude i'm as calm as a [ __ ] typewriter okay they don't have emotions the anger. that i had is realized into. the love and excitement that this person's gonna have to. see me with my pants around. my ankles and my [ __ ] privates on display while. i'm unloading and in walks a [ __ ] twelveyearold and i go oh that's funny. that's funny lord that is funny. and i mean lord this singer.
