well i didn't come. here first of all i've been there. probably or i'm coming i just haven't announced it. yet but thank you uh for coming. out and those are the tickets. krista dot com uh so without further ado this is the new episode. of congratulations [music] my hair. is looking fancy man. see that's the thing you know. i never know i washed. my hair and then sometimes that day. it's banging and then sometimes. it's not it's the next day. that's banging and i wash. my hair today and it's banging. and i wash my hair every three four. days and that's what's up. dude everyone says i look greasy and it's all good. my babies i look greasy but i'm not greasy man. i'll tell you what i'm probably. one of the cleanest dudes. you know when it comes to. uh you know smells and all that. stuff i brush my teeth. all the time shower all. the time the only thing i don't do every day. is wash here because i heard it's bad. for it but i don't really know. if i subscribed to. all that maybe it's bad. too uh wash your hair. every day but people are like you gotta leave the group. the grease on it. because you know it's healthy. for the hair it's not healthy. to to always wash it. it dries it out. i do what i want when it comes. to that kind of stuff. and what i want to. do is be clean but you know. sometimes i feel i don't know. and my hair is looking good. and uh and that's that about the hair. stuff really the hair the hair. stuff really is that's what's up. i um well i mean i had a crazy. great week um which is you know. the uh what should i talk about first. i had well let's just talk about the baby. i mean we had a baby. and congratulations to me and my wife. and calvin and all of the family. members and extended family. and and you know what dude. we got another uh baby. in the log cabin that's uh that's gonna help. build it uh his name. is william mchenry dalia and uh he is. beautiful and he's very healthy. and he's strong too uh. he rolled over it's been five. days and he already rolled. over that's not common they say. like it takes like a few months. and william goes like this. no uhuh um and rolled over. in five days so that's great. uh i i i it's i it's so wild. becoming a dad again. uh people say that like oh congratulations. you're a dad again which is weird. to me because you're still a dad. you're you're you've been a dad. you're not a dad again. you're a double a double. dad now and um so it's a it's it's you know. we're in that post partum thing. where it's been six days. and you know i don't know. how to even i'm reminded. of all this feeling which is wild. because you know william. hasn't really opened up his eyes. yet i mean he kind of opens up. and looks every now and then but then he's like i liked it. better on the inside. you know he's like one of those. convicts that's like i i've been away. for so long i don't know how to. do this anymore i i'm back. in and then just robs a bank not even to. get the money just to. get back in there but you can't. go back into the womb. it's destroyed at this point. you know so um well we don't know. if we're going to. call him william or billy or will or or willie. billy boy we're calling him a lot you know. he's a little little boy. but the only comment when he gets to. be older but i like the one of the reasons. why i like william first of all. is my dad's name and second of all. it's the kind of name. where you got a lot. of nicknames you can pick you. know chileam chili chili boy you. know trillium which is cool. when it gets older. what up trillium you know. willie my nelly probably shouldn't say that. but you know it's it. is it is uh he could pick and we can pick. too so we don't know. what we're gonna call him. but william is his name. and uh it's great. and it's really fantastic. and we went in to. uh first of all my wife. at the end there her. brain it was like it was filled with just you name it. uh what is it the silly. putty she was just so what you know. who she was like the right. harm i'm his right. i miss her sterling everything. i'm his right arm hand. man i'm a silly. rabbit is that what he calls you. no that was what my wife. was by the end of it. i would be like would you like a sandwich. and she'd be like let's say. what is it what is that uh well there's turkey in it. no what's a sandwich dude. it was insane there has been a scrape on our car. her car it's annoying. and you know because look i'm not women's. great cars and um you know and it's not because they're they don't know how to. drive that is that is a fallacy when people say this is a sexist. trope going around like oh women. can't drive i don't subscribe. to that women they don't care. see i'm not gonna be like oh yeah women. can't drive that's not true. it's women they don't care about. your possessions right so when there's a curb they go like this. oh you know what i'll try. that one and then you go. what you scrape the rip. and they and they say well don't yell at me. and then you feel bad yes. dude they got it all figured out. right but um yeah and so so so so so that's so we had to. scrape on the side. of the car and it's from of all. things our own gate. all right all right so not something. that she doesn't know about because you know. why dude because it's our own. gate right and it's always there okay so she scrapes it. she doesn't just scrape it. once she scrapes it twice. here's the great here's the best. thing about it same. exact place you not even two scrapes. so i'm like wow that's amazing. how do you even do that. so she's scraping it this. is months ago. and i and i i walk out and say babe. you scrape the side of the thing. and she was like i don't know i see it's because you parked too close. and already i'm just like oh stop the cap. okay you got plenty of feet. on the other side so let's use it. um and she does she doesn't want. to get close to. the bloody guts i get it. she doesn't want to. scrape the bloody guts. so she'd rather scrape the gear. it's better scrape one card. and two cars that's fine. right one time my uncle backed up my dad's car. into his other car. and it's all good you know. you gotta take two of the cars. in but so scrape that i saw it. with my own eyes somehow it's my fault. so i say oh you know. you know what okay. fine i got mad but i tried to. swallow it you know. it's real hard to. swallow my anger because you can still. tell i'm mad you know. like guys try to. like be like well if i don't react. i talk about this in my act. but like if i don't react. then she can't get mad at me. for not being mad and then look at you. and you're like this darting your head. around like a like a like a meerkat. and you're like what i did. i didn't say anything. and there's just a scrape in the car. that would have never happened. if i were driving that is fine. are you saying women can't drive no that's sexist. i'm saying they don't give a [ __ ] about your possess. your possessions right that's why. there's a [ __ ] banana peel and then inside of the [ __ ] thing and it's this is there right and so but it's fine whatever i realize life's about bigger issues who cares to. scraping a door my wife's a beautiful. angel who cares right. she texts me the day. before we go in to. get the baby out whatever they call. it inducing induction like like it's like a hall of fame. like we're like the baby's getting induced. women i'm going to get i'm going. in to get induced. like they like they like they caught some fly. balls you know i'm going. in to get induced. like you're a member of the 40. 40 club like not dude. all right oh hey are you my wife. or are you ricky henderson. dude we're going to. get induced no dude. don't act like it you you don't. act like we're going to. cooperstown dude they voted they're they're voted. they want to. retire my they want to. retire my shirt which is. basically your shirt because that's all i've been wearing for the past. four months foreign i'm going. to get induced so we go. and we and and the day. before we get induced she's. at sweet greens and she texts. me she's like you know. that valet that guy. that doesn't like me [laughter]. up in her head you know. hey you know that valet. guy women will say some [ __ ] where you gotta go like huh. well hold on let me. go way back into. my catalog and see if i've ever. had a conversation about this. and then you go and then you say no i i don't know. and then they what what do. you mean and then you're like well okay. i don't see how this is going. to work out anything. at all favorable for me. or you can just be like oh yeah. that guy and then they keep talking but then maybe you'll get caught in a lie. so really there's no win right. so you know the valet. guy that hates me. and i i go deep i'm like i'm on like dial up. trying to remember this. dude and i remember the dude. i'm like oh yeah that's right. you said he was rude. and the thing and so i said what's up. she was like don't don't get mad. but i think he scraped the car. the audi and i am and i say oh. my god no way and i'm pissed. right i mean i'm i'm pissed. but i'm like you know what before. i get mad let me. find out more information about this. so say where is it. and she says on the door. and i said well is it. below the door because if it's below the door. then the good thing is. we have to replace. that anyway because of and i'm trying. to be very careful. but the [ __ ] that you did right now i'm not trying to. be a dick but right. because of the way you've been driving. ray charles right now i'm not trying. to be a dick. do you know what i'm talking. about but just the way. you pull in the driveway. helen keller is an absolute. travesty okay it's like you might as well have stephen. hawking behind the wheel. okay oh no i scraped the side. even he would be aware. of it no you're right. i had much more room next. to the bloody gods. i should have pulled more. to the right. there were five feet. there were there was five there. was so much negative space. and i instead went left. and cut it so close. to the gate. that the screw sticking out. absolutely obliterated under the door. at the audi rsq8. the car is so expensive. this will be so much money. it's going to. be so much money and also it. it will be a challenge because would you have to. would you rather fix it. yourself or pay the extremely. eye deductible on this. absolute sports luxury car. yeah yeah yeah yeah you're [ __ ] yeah yeah yeah yeah your [ __ ] husband and also don't be mad commence water. coming out commence eyes raining um. why are you being so mad. it's making my eyes rain so. um dude i won't do it. once i'll do it twice. um anyway dude so i say all right. well where is she's like it's on the door. and i was like well send a pic. she sends a pic and to. me it doesn't just look like it's near it. it looks like it's exactly. on it it looks like it's exactly. on the scrape oh well lucky. us so i say babe. that looks like the scrape that. you did when you hit the gate. and she says no i don't know. i don't think so and i said well you scrape the gate. right in the same place. it just says this one's higher. so i say okay. you know what i choose. you know what i choose. happiness okay now i'm pissed but i choose. happiness because you know what you can. do that you can do that. when somebody goes hey buddy [ __ ] you you could just go like this. no i choose happiness. so that's what i'm doing. i'll wait for her to get home. no you know what i do. i stop at the nail. place that she's at because i know she's there and i want to. go surprise her and i also and this wasn't a secret. thing but i also do want to. i do want to. see this scrape i pull over i go. into the nail. place i say hey what's up and she's like oh what's up. i'm finishing hi oh my god. hey you know so i say. oh i'm gonna go i'm gonna actually go. look at this scrape she says okay. i go i look at the scrape there's one it's the same. exact it's the same. exact scrape as the one. that she did they didn't do. it again dude it's her it's she did. it the whole time it was like the end. of the sixth sense. you're like oh my god it's you it. was like an m night shyamalan. movie at the end where it's just like. it was it was hard. that's creepy tell me more. about that so now i'm like oh oh i'll go. back and say this is what you did. and she said it is and i said yeah. remember use memory and i know that. memory is like you know you don't remember. the things that you don't. need to remember but hey check this. out now ding ding something you need to. remember that was the dumbest. one i ever did dude. but dude hey check dude. oh [ __ ] it's something she needs to.

really look oh the disrespect. dude she didn't look she didn't. know the scrape's been there. for months and now she's getting. mad at a guy at the [ __ ] ballet guys live in him and i'm pissed off at i gotta be i'm like maybe i have to. fight this guy if she said i think he keyed it. so i'm like we can get this. baby out of you dude. because you don't what's you've got a potato. in your head huh. she's like sorry i don't even know. i'm just pregnant it was. like so weird so oh then that night i'm on a meeting. of a meeting with my for my a brain. for my addiction. you know i'm on a zoom. [ __ ] anonymous meeting because i'm a you know because of me and she knocks on the thing. and now i'm like i'm in a [ __ ] i can't all right. i did she knocks again. i open up and i'm so what's up. she said we're going to. get the baby out tomorrow. they have an opening. and i was like oh [ __ ] awesome it's like [ __ ] waiting in line to. buy a porsche you know they're like it's here. finally uh we just go in tomorrow. and get this baby so we go in we get the baby. out and uh man first of the first time. i i we had a kid. it was so emotional. for me so i'm like dude. it's gonna be so emotional. and i know that because i think that that. it's not gonna be as emotional. as it was because i'm ready. like because i wasn't ready. last time this time. he ready right so they say you know. we get there at 10. pm they they start they give her. like a pill in. the in it in her. like it you know. they just literally like go. in and drop it off like it's a prescription. like they go in they drop it. off like it's some film. in 1995. they go like hi. i'm the midwife uh. we're gonna start with i had no. idea but like i know. about uh the balloon. thing that they put in women. to make the space. for the cervix to. dilate i'm a doctor dude and uh they pump it up you know. pump it up joe budden. comes in and he's just like and so so before. this because calvin when he was born. it took 14 hours 13. hours but like she was only in hardcore. labor or whatever they call it. i'm a doctor but for like an hour. and a half and that's super quick. especially for the first baby. and they're like the second one. comes quicker and i'm like quicker. than an hour and a half. i was like ordering dominoes. so they're like so all right. you're not really dilating yet. your cervix is a little bit. soft and but so what we're gonna do. before we put the balloon. in because the calvin just got the balloon. they just put the balloon. in [ __ ] pump it up and now this time they're like we're gonna drop a pill in there and i was like what and we're gonna we're gonna the the doctor looked at the midwife looked at me and she was like so what we're going to. do is we're going to. drop a pill in. your wife's [ __ ] it's gonna dissolve it's gonna get a little bit more softer and then we're gonna put in the balloon. and we're gonna have joe biden come in and i'm like okay. right medical terms we're going to. get the pill we have. we have a pill. we put it in your wife's [ __ ] and then what happens. is it dissolves right. so we put in our nappy. dog out it dissolves right. so your wife right. we open it up we look. at the hatchet wound we put it in the hatchet. wound um right so what we do is we take this. so there's look there's a hungry. fried butterfly right there's a hungry. fry butterfly so we give this pill. to the hungry butterfly and um and we put and and they put the pill. in by the way like birth. it's so complicated like i know. it's completely natural and at the end. of the day that baby's coming out. and you know back. in could you imagine having a baby. back in like the 1500s that's why so the birth. rates were like the pack the fact that these babies. survived that i'll tell you what. man i'm i was born in 1980. if i was born in i mean. any earlier than that yo dead. on arrival straight up me i don't no way no way because there's got to. be that point where you're you. know you're sucking on the inlet. umbilical cord [ __ ] with your tummy. right and then you pop. out and by the time. you pop out you're breathing. air you're like all right. well what's up with this. but i would have been like i'm not i don't. want to i don't want to. right like i'm sure they had some hightech [ __ ] in the 80s. where they were just like we gotta he's coming. we gotta get him. out push push they knew [ __ ] but dude you put me and i'm telling you anywhere from 1945 earlier i'm not they don't know enough to. get me to come. out dude they don't know enough so i'm like i'm staying in and i'm getting to. that point where you know. it's like oh he's got to. breathe air now but like i'm scrunched. up against the upper vagina. part and i'm like i'm not coming. out and that's me doa. dude cause i'm smooshed up. against the upper vagina. part i can't breathe. you know what i'm saying but they knew what. to do and so they were like all right. do the who who to. my mom so i came out. but i'm just saying dude. it's so complicated it makes setting up. like a [ __ ] ps5 look like eating. a banana birth is crazy. and that you know. it has to. be that way so now there's you know. there's too many people in the world. but this is why because they figured all this. [ __ ] out and so so now they're like i'm and so they're like so the pill. dissolved and the cervix is very we're at two. centimeters so now what we're gonna do. we're gonna put the balloon. in and i'm gonna just check that. and there we go. and i'm feeling the head. and the wind wife is like dude. there's so much [ __ ] going on it's like i don't even understand we gotta move it we're gonna move it so what happens. is the cord is. uh might be below the head. and that's bad because the baby's adjusting the heart. rate might drop but and i'm just like just this. is so she's like and then the wifi. went out and and so the wifi. is out in the womb. you don't understand what's happening. and it's so much and you're like i don't want to. know any of this and they're just telling you because they have to. and in a way it. kind of makes you feel better. but then five hours go. by and they're like you're at five centimeters and they say check on you. in a little bit they leave. my wife's chilling looking. at her phone and all of a sudden she says oh my god. like a [ __ ] like an old lady that has just seen the most brilliant the most brilliant uh what do they call him bougainvilleas. just the most brilliant bougainvillea she's ever. seen in her life like a 72 year. old that just walked by and just went oh my god like that's how she looked at me yes dude. [ __ ] naming something different you know bougain vegas most [ __ ] name for a [ __ ] flower and uh like the book in v is like some an island you would go to. if you were like some [ __ ] stupid white idiot. chick on instagram that has wanderlust in her. [ __ ] bio you know wanderlust you know what wanderlust means. for real hooker that's what that. means i swear to. god if you see a chick bragging. about she's into. wanderlust that means she's sucking dick. on all of the islands wanderlust. means hooker so [ __ ] gay speaks. the truth man i swear. to god so she says oh my god like a 72 year. old seeing a bunch of brilliant. bougainvilleas and then i say what. and she doesn't say anything. and i'm like you got to. follow that up immediately during now. or i'm like oh you're looking at online. like what's happening like on all. sorts of red flags are. going so she says i think my water. broke and i say really and i look dude. the nurse comes in peels. back the thing it was like it. was like you know in the movies. when you see water break. and you're like okay well you're like that's not how it is that. probably just leaks a little looks like. the girl's ttn you know. right like you're watching a julia roberts. movie and the side character. like their water breaks. and it's and you're like whoa. bro so much water. came out that it was like oh how do i say this. harrowing you know like i was like oh my god. i i had the same feeling. i saw on the opening. scene of saving private. ryan when the guy's looking for his. arm because the germans blew it. off you know and theirs. was like oh okay and she and then chris was like does that. happen which is the number one. thing i say is this. the normal you know. you want to. know and she was like does that. happen and the nurse. was like yeah and i was like it doesn't happen. the way she's saying it. though you know say it with more conviction. nurse does that happen. uh yeah it can oh but she's duh. she's lying the way she did. it don't sing it. yeah but i'm lying so now. i'm like oh for [ __ ] sake so the baby's heart rate went down. a little bit because all of a sudden. the baby was chilling. on this sack of water. like a bean bag. just chilling love is. good you know and then all of a sudden. and the and the babies uh what's up. this it was five all. of a sudden kristen is like man. you gotta put the epidural kick it up. a notch and she starts. contracting the card they were like don't have the baby. yet the doctor's not here this. is happening so quickly. we're gonna call the doctor and chris. is like is the doctor close. and she's like yeah and so she's having the the the contractions. and the the midwife. is like just hold it. the doctor's not here yet. and chris is like i can't i gotta push and then the doctor shows. up and kristen's like i can't. believe how this is so she's trying. to get her feet you. know the epidural makes your they stick. a syringe in your back in your uh spine. and then your legs go. numb which is just like nah that's creepy. tell me more about that. so so she the doctor shows. up and the doctor's like okay. let me look and she's like okay. let's have this baby. um so okay so push kristen pushed. once and william was just like sup. dude he came out and just she pushed. one time and then we and then the baby. was there and then the baby. was so i mean so so purple. that i thought it was a california. raisin and i couldn't it was and he came out. and they were like he wasn't really crying. and of course i was scared. of [ __ ] they're like we got to. get him to cry. more hold on and they're like tickling. him and it took like 40 minutes for him. to really just let out that yeah. and then uh well that sounded so good and so and then um and now he's great. he's so good he's so healthy and it's just a beautiful. thing and then after the baby. came her legs went numb. so that's cool um and now her brain. [ __ ] works again thank god. so now i'm a full [ __ ] family guy like forget. it and i'm still not wanting. to go to coachella. so that's great i don't man. it just i know i've always been against coachella. you know that i don't always say. i'm against it i would just never go. somebody said to. me the other day like would you go to. coachella ever and i i was like [ __ ] no that seems like my nightmare i would rather go to. stagecoach than coachella that's how much i don't want to. go to coachella because i also i'm not like a huge fan. of country but like i would rather. go to stagecoach. because it seems a little bit. more chill like i don't. want to be listening to. like hardcore like holy. [ __ ] music i want to. be chilled out if i'm going. to be at a [ __ ] place i want to. be chilled out right and you could probably do. that at country because there's a lot. of slow singing in country. you know i know there's frank. ocean and [ __ ] but it's like a coachella but i just i don't want to. go so uh and then i'm looking at these um pictures of coachella. and i see all the hot. chicks and i'm like i'm gonna okay. i don't wanna okay. let's not but no you know. what i mean and then uh i'm like okay. well actually no okay i'm happy. actually and uh and i'm like what would it. take for me to. go to coachella i think it's just bad. period also i'm 43 right. or do four yeah 40. they still go though. people [ __ ] live it up in coachella they were so mad like rioting because of what's his name didn't have the merch. franco ocean frank ocean. wow so mexican um hey you like that. guy frank ocean right. when he drives around. in his chevy um so uh i don't really know. anything about coachella to. be brutally honest with you. guys did anything interesting happen. no right same [ __ ] we're in. the holograms uh this whole thing. i i looked at and this. was nuts so let me read. this with you i mean the whole thing. here is insane parody hitman. so wait this is a parody. hitman website that exists and there. is a national air national. guardsman that that thought it was real and allegedly. applied for murder for hire. jobs first of all don't do that. blindly okay hey dude uh i am a hitman. i'm out of work this. sucks i'm gonna go on craigslist. that's basically what he said. okay hitman will take care. of somebody for 100 flowers. um so this guy josiah hosea jose how do you pronounce that ernesto garcia. okay uh eventually agreed to. kill someone for five thousand. dollars on a conversation. with an undercover fbi. agent so all right this. is an fbi agent. that's undercover and it's also. a parody so what's the deal. here kind of weird don't really. understand it but as we keep going. air national guardsmen was arrested. and charged thursday with applying. to be a hitman. on a parody website 21. tennessee came across www. dot rentahitman dot com you know. as he was searching. for contract mercenary jobs to. support his family okay. made me kind of pulled up. my heartstrings right there uh the u.s so uh the website was created in 2005. and to advertise a cyber. security startup but when it failed. it would get inquiries for hitman. services okay so it's administrator converted it. to a parity site with false. testimonials from people who claim to. have used its services the criminal complaint. says wow wow garcia applied on the website. for work as a hitman in. february submitting identification documents. and a resume this. guy couldn't just say it was a joke. right as well as indicating he was. an expert marksman earning him the nickname. reaper um and was employed in the air. national guard since 2021. okay garcia continue to. follow up the website for about a month. how stupid can you be even. more identifying information including his home. address and a headshot dude. a headshot like it's a state. farm commercial and eventually agreed. to kill someone for five thousand. dollars in a convert in. a conversation with an article so he met. he met up with the guy. undercover agent now when did. they get the undercover agent. involved is what i'm saying because this whole. thing with wow and they had a target. packet with the fictional individual like. this is the guy no questions. after agreeing to. the terms of the murder arrangement. dude how far was this joke. gonna go i killed him. psych jokes on you no. he's dead though uh garcia. asked the agent if he needed to. provide a photograph of the dead. body garcia was then arrested. by fbi agents wow. bro he's gonna get off. because he's just gonna be like nah. it's joking i just want. to see how long man. this is hilarious dude. for
