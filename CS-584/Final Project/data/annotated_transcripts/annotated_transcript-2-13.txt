honestly. i feel like it's just two. movies are too long. now i guess sometimes the netflix. ones or the stream ones. are not long but like you go to. the theater man movies in the theater. man i mean sometimes these movies. two and a half hours. what what happens when you want. to start a movie at 11. o'clock at night you don't put on the two. and a half hour. one you put on the [ __ ] uh one and a half hour. one so you know i don't know i mean. maybe that's boring to. talk about but it's like at least it. was quick right at least. it was quick that's my whole. point when someone's like oh you just told a bad story i'm like yeah but it was quick the balls for a movie to. be that long period. you know like i really want to. see oppenheimer but you know it's three plus. hours right i mean. christopher nolan is great and yeah. if there's somebody's gonna do it sure okay yes but how run time. of oppenheimer there we go three hours and he knew it oh [ __ ] dude he knew it not cause he's psychic because people are predictable right. three hours and nine seconds. knew it was just just eeked. it out over there. huh dude i can't imagine could you. imagine like you know. and that movie's gonna make bank too barbie's. two hours you know barbie's two. hours like what make barbie. an hour what the [ __ ] do we have to. see for two at dads. with their daughters in the audience. just like oh [ __ ] man god they don't even have genitalia what's that. nothing that's so annoying i don't get it. man but cillian murphy is a silly. in her yes silly. and he's really good at acting. oh robert downey jr's in it. that's cool and then jack quaid. is in it dennis quaid's uh daughter. i don't know maybe maybe it's a guy. i guess it's a son. but i don't i just i assume the other way. now just to. make the left happy. um yeah oh dude. you know what i dude. killian it's killian murphy whatever it is. who you know killian's kind of a cool. name um i have worked out. and then i didn't work out the last two. days i've been working out. so hard where i go. where where then i feel sick. afterwards and not like nauseous. like flu and i'm like what is this. so i google it i got fibromyalgia i don't but you know. it says hey you know what it. definitely is fibromyalgia so i go. i got fibromyalgia so i go. home and i say you know. what i'm going to. do i'm going to. talk about it with uh my wife. she's gonna make me feel better. i text ah look what happened. i get you know how i've been getting. flu symptoms after i work out for three. days check that screenshot out. sent it to fibromyalgia. with the it said i get home. because she doesn't respond. because kristen is absolutely terrible. with her phone great and i get home. and i and she says so do you really you think you got fibromyalgia. huh and i was like oh i don't know. and she's like oh i don't know. we should get it checked out. and i'm like oh great. you're not even gonna make me. feel and it's like okay. so i said you really think i have it. she said i don't know. i was like oh dude. you're not even doing the comforting. thing so then i stopped i didn't stop working out. because i've been feeling like that. i stopped working out because i had to. go to tucson. the day on saturday. then i came back on sunday. and it was father's day. so i didn't work out saturday. and sunday and it's monday. now and i didn't work out today. yet but still started. feeling like [ __ ] at the end of the day. so it's not because we're working out. so i guess i don't have fibromyalgia instead. i just have a permanent

of let them. get in there and you chill. and you just you know. i got a really i've got a really nice dentist. and then a woman who cleans the the [ __ ] which is it's all a scam really because here's why i'll tell you it's a scam i said when's the last time i came here and he said seven years and i said okay my teeth feel fine he's like well let's get in there gets in there he says man i hate to. say it but for seven. years i mean this is absolutely fantastic. do you keep up and i was like yeah. but like i don't you know. i brush my teeth. twice a day that's what i do. i do when i wake up. in the morning and then i do it. at night and sometimes i do it. in the middle of the day. do i floss no do i use. a little hook things. that kristen says i should use no and they're in there. just getting it you know. and it feels good. dude and it hurts but it feels. good you know and it's all too. loud and it's just you know. and uh i got it done. and i left and i you know. what i said to. the lady doing my teeth. i said so what i gotta wait. like a half an hour. to eat or something and she says ah now. i can do whatever. you want and i was like yeah. but they make you wait. like don't you have to. clean you know when you're a kid. they would tell you that she's like nah. just whatever i was like so i could drink. this coffee right. now and she's like yeah that's up. to you and i was like so they were just lying. to us as kids. remember that [ __ ] i don't believe anything about time. now when they say oh you should remember. when they would say like oh dude. you shouldn't go and swim in it. after you eat like what. why why what's gonna happen. you're in water it's not. like the pool in involves just. getting a bunch of fingers poked in your mouth. and like just right you're not swimming. in in [ __ ] laxatives you're just it's it's it's water. it doesn't who ate a sandwich. and then immediately jumped in the pool. and you oh i try it. later i just eat and then jump in dude. it doesn't happen you're fine. you ever do the thing where you're like. uh let me just try. it i'll eat yeah. [ __ ] it i don't want to. wait i'm just gonna go. in a pool and you're like it's actually fine. huh i don't like that they lie. to us dude. um yeah so i went to. the dentist they've been lying. to me for you you. find it you find these things. out man it's like next thing. i'm gonna [ __ ] i'm gonna find out. the tooth fairy isn't real um but yeah i uh i did. i went to. the dentist he cleaned my teeth. and then i go like this. because i have this bottom rung thing on on. the bottom there and it was from when i had braces. and i was like dude. can i get this all because one night i was like i s i've had this. retainer in the back of my teeth. it's it's physically there i can't remove it. okay it's been there for uh like 25. years right and one night three two no two weeks. ago i was like man. this [ __ ] thing is still here like i've lived most of my life with this [ __ ] thing in my mouth that's uncomfortable what if i'm in bed and i can't sleep and i'm like what if this is just like something that if i remove it i'm like oh my god what how have i been living like that like like we didn't know that uh when you you know how you do circumcisions like oh my [ __ ] is i'm i'm snipped in the in the front not like my vast difference i can still have kids but you snip the tip and you let the the flower come out right and that's so that so the penis is a turtleneck on just chilling right like it looks like a pig in a blanket and and i we didn't know until recently that that actually makes it less sensitive and it's oh it's y'all you're gonna ruin the one of the greatest things busting. you're gonna ruin squirting. you're gonna ruin me. spraying out ropey barbells huh. it's supposed to. be the best thing you're gonna make it. a little bit worse dude. i want the best thing. to be so the best. that when it happens. i want to. think whoa i can't do that. again for days my dogs. are barking pulse so annoying. dude speaking of genitalia they don't even have nuts you. know like there's hey shut up stop i [ __ ] god hate uh we have four. dogs dude you know we had i had two i fell in love so okay. another one because of love and and then you know she had one and then and then she had to. [ __ ] find one in panorama. city dude i wish you just kept driving but now we have [ __ ] trash. dog anyway dude what was i talking about before. penises squirting was for squirting. dude the the [ __ ] dentist and the thing so what if i am. like so i said this. can i get it out. and he says wow and i'm like oh it's another scam. dude nothing's even happening. you know they're barking sorry. i had to cut for a second. because i had to. go out and tell him to. stop i had to have a real sit down. with my dogs but um that's what dmx says after a business. meeting um so uh so i said so i said can you can you get it. out can you get out. the the retainer and he says well the thing. is sometimes we remove. it and uh uh and the teeth. shift and i'm like i've had this account for 25. years you don't think my teeth. are happy to. where they are and he's like yeah. i mean it happens. a lot you don't know. so i'm like so what if you were movies. it could happen there's a chance it. could or you could just leave it. and then i'm back i'm thinking back. to the night where i couldn't. i couldn't i was i was basically having a panic. attack like i really worked myself up i'm like there's a [ __ ] something in my mouth. it's metal it's been there forever. like i'm just i can't sleep. and then i dude i've been having crazy. sleep problems for some reason. crazy sleep problems like where

thing in my dude. i gotta i've already gotta start. dealing with my anxiety a little bit better. but i have been because i go to. a lot of therapy you know. anyway um so i let out i am like all. right

what oh my gosh. oh my god i can't imagine again. we're doing that you know. [ __ ] what i mean dude like just so out of it. there's another one i'll tell you more. and more i think about it. what i did was i can't. get what i want yeah. i know i'm just wow dude. i'm taking it as it. comes said absolutely nothing dude i love. that [ __ ] i used to. get that tired back when i was uh dating. my exgirlfriend and she revealed to. me a year later while we were still going. out she was like dude. you know i thought you had a pill. problem and i was like what this. is back before i even. took any sort of medication. for anxiety i was like i've never taken. a pill in my life. which was the truth. and she was like uh really i i yeah. i thought you had a pill. problem because the way you would talk. as you were falling. asleep that's what i would do. i got i never started. i did that anymore. and then [ __ ] bro i was so tossed off of nyquil honestly the xanax doesn't even i don't even tell it i take such a low dose i don't even tell anymore. but i could bro i don't know what's going on. my sleep it's just been so bad. i'm getting old dude. maybe i can't eat late at. night i don't know what it. is but bro i don't want to. give that up man that's like my only [ __ ] source of guilty pleasure. now it's just eating late at. night oh man. anyway i went to. tucson the tour reports. up go check it out. on the other channel tucson. is just i love phoenix. man i really do i love phoenix. and i love arizona but also what's tucson. you know like is it just is it. closer to. albuquerque tucson is albuquerque basically they've got those small mexican. houses that are like turquoise. and also beige and a little bit like brown. red and it's like where they don't. even have windows you know they have windows. but like no glass over it. it's just like they're like yeah. just don't rob us dog. it's like the culture. but it's all it's also like have [ __ ] indoor ac right um but that was fun. 1500 people came out in tucson. loving it um and we just had a fantastic. time dude i saw the first episode. of um black mirror coming back. and um it was good. the first half was so good. i loved how netflix. was like making fun of itself. with this thing stream berry the episode. black mirror season six count and then um the the the second. half of it it just i mean. dude it was so inside. and so jerk off fest for hollywood. it was so bad dude. it was so [ __ ] sucking bad i couldn't even believe it. and it was just like salma hayek. was in it and they were trying. to make her funny and it was just like so written and it was just so [ __ ] bad dude i don't know how you can make like here's the deal black mirror black mirror was so good season one season two and after that you can't keep doing it you can't keep making good shows it can't last for more than like two seasons because it's so hard to. sustain that world and and i know every episode. is different and every now and then they do come. out with a good one and you know look god bless man. you're gonna make a good one. you're gonna make a bad one. you're gonna that some of the best. stuff has also some of the worst. stuff in it because you need to. take chances but holy [ __ ] man it's like you can't keep making [ __ ] that is going to. be such a great grand. idea and then it's all dependent on this. twist at the end to. where this is why. m night shyamalan movies. [ __ ] suck now you know and i'm not saying he doesn't make good movies. sometimes sometimes he does but like when you're always waiting. for this [ __ ] twist at the end it's like dude. and then the twist how many twists. can you make besides oh they they were dead. the whole time that's a great. twist and then the second one. was oh he's a superhero. okay cool great twist. and then the third one. is like oh they all live in a village. or whatever the [ __ ] that one was oh nature is mad at mark wahlberg or whatever the [ __ ] that one was you can't keep having twists oh a water. kills the aliens that. one sucked oh dude. it's water oh the thing. that sustained life for us is the thing that kills dude. waters everywhere eh then how could they we're made of water. the aliens are made of everything's water. and they're just walking around. and they find out because some [ __ ] daughter left a glass out that the alien can't dude hey that movie sucks. you can't rely on this [ __ ] this is why and i'll tell you what i made [ __ ] three four specials that was a silly goose time and that was by design i never wanted to. [ __ ] keep doing that but i was gonna ride that [ __ ] until i changed my idea of what i thought was funny until i change until i grew into. whatever i grew into. you know how many times can you [ __ ] rip roar. or a silly goose time. until you're the guy who's like oh [ __ ] you're 50. okay well i'm 43. now dude the last special i did. that shit's not just a silly. goose time dude it's the best. thing i've ever done. and you gotta change dude. once you get to. know once you get once. you become something and people know you as that. guy you can't do that. [ __ ] anymore it's it's it sucks. i mean i guess that's where the money. is but it's like dude. after i made fun of eminem and i made it in the video. i'm done i'm done i'm not doing. it anymore you know. why because people want want me to. i don't want to. do what people i don't want to. do that i don't want to. do that i think that there's a real thing. actually that you can like learn. from this especially if you're an entertainer. and [ __ ] if you become known for one thing. you can't you're a flash. in a pan dude and your boy's no. flashing a pan man. not to say i'm not shyamalan's. a flash depending he's not he really is a great. director and i always watch his movies. but then like the island makes you old or whatever. like come on dude. come on man it's not good. just because you had the guy. for me too mama tambien in. it that movie was good movie. dude hell yeah i. want to be in a [ __ ] spanish. movie like that and just be like and then just [ __ ] have one scene where i kiss a dude. wholeheartedly like and just stroke. them like and it shows. it but i'm not gay. but in the character. is gay i guess but i'm not gay. and i walk offset and i go all right. that's a wrap take that. [ __ ] rainbow flag down i'm not with that so you can not you know that that's what crystallia. says and they're like whoa. that was but i'm like but just so i don't i don't. like that [ __ ] that's how good of an actor i am i stroked the dude. and i'm against gays so that's how that's how good of an actor i am like colin farrell. and the penguin style [ __ ] that's how i do it it's cheating when you put that much makeup on as an actor i think honestly i think it's cheating and i don't i love colin farrell i think he's great but if i'm gonna do a movie uh and they're like yeah you gotta play a fat guy you know like brendan fraser should have just been like i'll just be this fat i'm kind of fat anyway when he did the whale and they're like we actually have really we want to. put a we want to. make it really fast. we got a fat suit. i i go you know what i'm not. doing it i'll just make let me. make the mummy nine. you know um because i don't it's like you know you get a [ __ ] a beautiful woman and then she does some movie where she plays a mom and they put a hook nose on. her and it's like all of a sudden. she's nominated for an oscar. and colin farrell's good but you you get extra credit. for that [ __ ] i don't i you know and i know obviously i'm not there but you know i got offered a thing recently i'm not i'm not i'll do it. when i want dude. how about that i got offered a thing. recently in hollywood i'll do. it when i want i don't want to. do it now so [ __ ] these [ __ ] that are like ah yeah you know i'm oh dude because when i do when i oh dude when i do i'm [ __ ] straight up ice in a whole.

[ __ ] crazy backlash but now it's just also people are coming around. you know we're gonna look back. i don't know how long it's gonna take but we're gonna look back. on this section of time. and i don't know if it's gonna be the 10. years or 20 years. whatever the second of time. is and it's gonna be like wow man. that [ __ ] was crazy dude. just as crazy as when like woodstock people were like just naked. out in mud just putting like like like pieces. of dirt like all in their anus. and just calling it free. love you know just chicks with their floppy sloppy tits out you know just bad tits in 1970. just with mud. all over them and big poofy. hair everywhere just listening to. the doors i dude. that whole music i i don't i don't. like i'm not a music. dude you know i mean. it really kind of does. sound like i hate everything. but i don't but like that whole music. of the 70s like the steve miller. band and [ __ ] it always sounded like any any genre of music. where it sounded like the recording. so far away from where the [ __ ] they're supposed. to be recording you know. what i'm talking about you know. what i mean dude. like now music's just like be on it. you know but back then. it was like foreign that. guy with that [ __ ] instrument that was just some guy in the back. going whoop whoop whoop that. though that music sucks dude. now we're all up in it. sounds like the music's inside. your head man music sure did suck back. then people try to. tell me the beatles are good. and then you're like all right. play something we all. live in a yellow turn that. off thanks people [ __ ] say yeah well what about bob marley. oh well why because of the political. stance that he's uh oh yeah we jamming we're jamming yeah we hopping in the drama. the law yeah all right. dude eat my [ __ ] whole [ __ ] man that guy [ __ ] um what's who's the guy that got now there could be like nine people but there's the rapper that's on on on trial for murder ymh no no not your mom's house why am why a guy somebody who's gonna what is it it's unwanted for killer and then ynw ynw nelly melly i mean so the name you know just wanted for murder or i guess 24 years old and just like in in songs is just like yeah i [ __ ] kill a [ __ ] i did it it was on you know it was on this street at that cross street at this time it's like it's not even rhyming he's just saying what he did and and they're using it against him and then the prosecution just was like they got the the dm from him and it was like and he was like talking to. somebody's like yeah i did that. you know how i killed that. guy and it's just like hey guy. all right dude what are you doing. man if you're gonna kill someone shut up about it. hey if you're gonna do something like that. don't make a song about it. huh i don't know maybe he didn't. do it i have no idea. i always i'm a weirdo. though man like maybe i um it's so weird. when people are like yeah [ __ ] it i hope he goes to. jail [ __ ] and then it's also weird to. be like free him because like you don't know but then also like i always want it. to work out because i don't want to. think that [ __ ] somebody killed someone does that make me [ __ ] naive i have no idea dude i hope that melody and w melly didn't [ __ ] shoot anybody even though he made songs about it you shouldn't be able to. use rap or hiphop as proof though. but i don't think you can because it's a story you're telling the story foreign. be like if i made a song i don't like when my wife. argues with me it's so [ __ ] annoying when she makes me put dishes in the dishwasher it's my only chore but it's the worst. one because you get pasta. on yeah chris do you hate. when you have to. put the dishes into. the dishwasher ah no not really. i don't do you hate. when your wife gets on. you for that ah no i don't what. about when you uh get pasta. on your fingers no okay. see exhibit a i want to. play the song i hate my wife. and when she does this. i don't though she's my angel you know what i mean. i love jokes are jokes. you know but i really be loving. her all right i had to. put the dogs back out. again even though please get them. out dogs have more more half better. better have a better in a house. than me anyway um i saw this. thing bebe rexa rex who i don't even i'm i'm so out. of it she's probably super famous. singer obviously i guess she got man. i hate people someone threw a [ __ ] phone at her head you know so loud so loud oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] oh that hurt. god damn too if it man. if it was my phone. it would hurt a lot. too because of [ __ ] my eyes. my banking app in it and it makes my phone heavier um just so she posted the pics dude she had to. get stitches you can see the cut just above her eye. where she needed stitches. and there's significant bruising dude. that's crazy oh man.
