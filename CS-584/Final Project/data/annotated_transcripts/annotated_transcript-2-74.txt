[ __ ] sorry um um yeah [music] and uh we love it so yeah so you know we're firing in all syllables. we're having a good time we're doing the podcast. and uh we're on the road we love it. um i was at coffee. today and uh i brought my kristen. was getting her hair done i had to. drop dry bar blow dry. dry blow blow bar blow dry bar right. the yellow and white place. and uh and she was getting her hair. blowed and uh i was like okay. i mean i wasn't like okay. i don't know why i said that. part's just filling in silence. but uh she said why. don't you come to. mel's diner and bring calvin it'll be fun and i i say is that your dry bar. place and she said yeah and i said most dunner is a [ __ ] travesty. sucks you know it's terrible. it's on sunset and only tourists go there. and i have no beef against tourists but like it's not. good food it doesn't have. to be good food. because it's on sunset boulevard. and tourist go there do you understand. what i'm saying do you get what. i'm saying now so she was like yeah. but it'll be fun it's like a 1950s diner. so now i'm like okay. kristen's a cuda but it's all good. but we're all cudas right. we're all kind of get suckered. into that [ __ ] every now and then and i'm gonna sucker. for a good atmosphere too. i really am dude. i used to. love this strip club. so um so so kristen's like meet me at the uh at the at the and i'm like okay. well we could you know. i was like when are you done. she said 2 30 i. said okay that's fine. uh i'm gonna probably be uh ready. sooner than that i'll bring calvin. i'm gonna go sit near. the coffee bean until. if you know how i do it. and i want to. get cal calvin kind of indoctrinated. in the whole system here um so she says cool. go to the coffee. bean and tea leaf. and then i'll hit you up. when i'm done so i'm at the coffee. bean to leave i'm having a really great. time with calvin he's got his life. riff jacket on his denim. jacket which uh it was made by on instagram. his name is seamstress he's [ __ ] great. and uh he made me and calvin some matching life. reps jackets and uh calvin. was kind of you know we were hanging having a good. time he had his little centipede. toy and uh i was born bubbles with the coffee. it was really cute. and uh so then kristen is like hey i'm done. where do you want to. meet and i said well you know. we're really close to. this cafe that i like called. dialogue which is great. they got a great. brisket burrito and i wanted it. but then she said oh okay. i said or we can go. to mel's you know but it's a little further for us. and she says let's go. to mel's so i go like this. okay because i'm a good person. oh i want to. go to dialogue cafe but i swallowed that so we go to. mel's because i do think actually males will probably be more fun for calvin. and also that's where krista wants. to go and honestly. i live life outside myself. now okay used to. be a selfish. guy dealing with it battling demons. but also my heart's on the outside above. my body at this point. like i said i pray. for my enemies so so we go. to mel's and we have mel's and why did i start talking about this. oh no so i was at the coffee. and i'm at the coffee. and i go to. leave the coffee bean. i get in the car i put calvin. in the car seat. i know there's always like i said if you know. something about this podcast. i talk about coffee. shops all the time. because i go i'm a regular baby. i love it and um when i go there. uh there's always what one crazy. person at a coffee shop. is never more than one. it's always like one guy i have a feeling. it's a conspiracy and there's always need to. be like one crazy dude. and i think it's so people won't sit there and post. up and stay on the wifi. with just a 450 dollar a 400. of a 4.50 [ __ ] macchiato for like seven hours at a time so the crate i can't be around. this crazy guy anymore. right i think that that it's a good. thing that coffee shops do. so this guy's a crazy. guy he's one of those guys that [ __ ] decals his car all up. he's like a holly dennis woodruff. is his name go. to denniswood dot com. he's a [ __ ] guy someday he'll walk up and he'll be like hey man i really like your comedy. and sometimes i see him. and he walks up and he says i watch your special. man you're not [ __ ] funny so i'm like all right dude look just pick one or don't pick and don't talk to. me so i never know. what honestly i know honestly. i don't know what dennis i'm. gonna get but that i don't want. even one dennis woodruff. so the guy [ __ ] uh knocks i get a knock on. my uh bloody guts calvin's. in the back seat and i i look. i see a bomber. jack i don't see the face. i open up the door like. a [ __ ] [ __ ] by the way i don't even see who it is i just see a bomber jacket and i open up. the door god could have [ __ ] shanked me the [ __ ] could have like dragged me out and beat the [ __ ] out of me i don't know who the [ __ ] it is i just huh i see i opened a door and it's this [ __ ] guy dennis woodruff one time he's at the coffee bean. and he just had an astronaut helmet. on like this is the kind of guy. i'm dealing with and he's got his dog. near my car and i don't want his dog. to jump up and scrape that [ __ ] pearl mat what you know that white the pearl white. mat you know what i'm saying it's hard to. match the paint with a [ __ ] she's got a big dog in his i don't want him to. i don't want him to. scratch up my car so. i go oh hey and he says is that. a sunroof on your car. and i said yeah man. he said oh that's bitching i said oh thanks. man and i closed. the door and i'm just like i try to. eat out of the um driveway. and from the back i hear calvin. say it was really nice to. see him [laughter] and i was like oh yeah yeah and it's like dude. no it's not but also a life. lesson right a life lesson. an acceptance a life lesson. in do i really pray for. my enemies because if i did i could sit here. and just breathe through. this and understand that this is a person. with a mental condition. and that's okay yeah he's monopolizing some some of my time. and yeah it makes my heart. hot and yeah it makes my [ __ ] palm sweaty but you know what dude life is good and my son he's not jaded. i am so maybe it was nice. to see him i tell you man. as a dad your son. or your children. they teach you some [ __ ] you just got to. be open to understanding it so. now next time i see dennis woodruff. depending on what you know. i'm gonna try and be in a good. if i'm in a good mood. i'm not going to. let it get in this. is the stuff i'm gonna take if i'm in a bad. mood and he says something. to me i'm going. to be like okay you know. great but if i'm in a good. mood i'm not gonna let him. move me over push me. over to a [ __ ] bad mood i'm gonna. stay in that good mood. and be like you know. what dennis rodrick in my head. i'm gonna be like yeah i'm at the problems. and that's fine but i accept. you and you know what it. really was nice to. see you and then i'm going. to [ __ ] go on my way it was really nice to. see him my legs caught. my legs caught um anyway you. know of course uh and then we went to. mel's diner and we okay so i was talking [ __ ] about my most diner in the beginning so i we went there and look i like to. say i'm not a cuda. to [ __ ] just grab it you know if you don't because i don't know what a coda is it's a [ __ ] barracuda and they just go to. chinese objects because they're shiny they don't really have much thought into. them and so that's what i say. when somebody's accuda they just are tricked. into going into a place. because of another reason than they actually want it. so um it's just programmed in their head. because we know we all. got a little bit of kuda. in us but like the guy who just gets [ __ ] hot. sauce chocolate hot hot chocolate sauce. on his [ __ ] ice cream and doesn't even think about if he wants it or not just because like oh that sounds nice but it's like wait a minute i'm actually an ice cream purist and i don't want to. have like [ __ ] like dude how about this actually and i i digress. but ice cream is good enough. all the places where it's like. come on in and see whatever. toppings you want go [ __ ] yourself dude eminems no thanks gummy bears. are you out of your mind. one time i was at a place. and they had [ __ ] pepperonis and so i'm just like no that's disgusting. but ice cream's fine. but anyway i digress. so we go to. mel's and i see on the thing i'm like i've been eating like a [ __ ] [ __ ] lately you know i had a burger the night before and a burger the night before that and they were both a mess they weren't like you know what i mean good burgers they were great the way they but they were [ __ ] you know what i mean and uh like chef's kiss of course but also you know doctor's kiss too because they're gonna see me sooner now that i ate them and uh uh so i i i've been eating like an [ __ ] i'm gonna get something light like a salad but then i'm looking at the menu and i'm like i'm not gonna get a salad at a diner if you get a salad at a diner honestly i can't even think of a bigger piece of [ __ ] person than does that and then unless you're a woman i get it but like a guy who gets a salad at a 1950s diner like a piece of [ __ ] right um and then also like so anyway so anyway right um so anyway i i look and i'm looking and i see this section that's called arnold schwarzenegger's protein section or something and i'm like what the [ __ ] did arnold schwarzenegger agree to. this [ __ ] on the menu. you know 100 just agrees to. everything they're just like we want to. put three items on a [ __ ] 1950s diner on sunset boulevard and name it after you is that okay and he's just like oh yeah what's on it it doesn't that actually doesn't matter just put it on there so um i look at the thing and it's got a uh eggs uh uh chicken slices of tomato. which is [ __ ] honestly eating tomatoes is like eating nothing. and then and then you also get um what else tomatoes chicken. oh yeah asparagus which is cool. you know i like my pee stinky. so and i see it's called. protein the protein plate. i hate when people talk. about protein because usually it's like people. who are just like they look. like [ __ ] sausages and they're just like big but they're like not cut and they're like you gotta eat protein. and you're like bro. talk to me when you can do. laundry on your abs. um and uh so but i gotta i'm like this. is kind of what i want. it's kind of light it's kind of nice. so i'm like i'll just get the protein. plate she says oh okay great protein. plate comes dude and it was great. so i didn't want to. talk [ __ ] about mel's diner i i haven't been there in 20 years. i got the same waitresses by the way. i've been there in 20. years i used to. go when i was coming up. in hollywood and um last time. i went was with eric. youngman and denis testa two. friends of mine so i haven't seen. them in a bit but you know. uh went to. went to the 1950 diner. and ate that [ __ ] and it was really good and then i wasn't done. dude you know i wasn't done. because there were no. carbs in the goddamn plate if you don't eat carbs. it's not really a meal. is it didn't eat any breads uh my son. got chicken fingers ate none of them. i didn't even need any of those. so i'm still hungry so i look. under the [ __ ] thing at the menu. and there's a protein. shake now i gotta say protein. again but i don't it's not called. a protein shake what it's called. is the protonator and i'm like well i'm not saying this. do you know what i'm saying. i want all of the ingredients but i don't want the umbrella. it's under so i say to. her can i get the protein. shake that's also on that section and she says the protonator and i said you said it. she brought it back. and it was okay. it was pretty good so anyway. i'm full of protein um. and i don't like when people say that. but i am so uh that's what's up. diana schwarzick has his own. [ __ ] i want a guy like the arnold schwarzenegger is too that's the thing he's too famous. for me to have somebody. like if they honestly talk to. me i'll go to. the restaurant that gives greg kinnear. a [ __ ] section um but yeah i saw in this article here this is on buzzfeed which so you know it's hardhitting facts. buzzfeed news right there's bud buzzfeed and then buzzfeed news. i guess which is hilarious. like that's they're trying to. be like the and there's an article i saw timothy chalamet's. agent revealed that he hadn't hasn't auditioned for anything. in over seven years. and it sparked a conversation. about nepotism privilege and industry connections. okay this article dude. so look apparently they were trying. to have timothy chalamet do gladiator too. which is sounds like literally a fake. movie they would make a a whole arc on in the show. entourage like gladiator two like does it. another gladiator or what the guy's dead. so i would go see it. i will go see if it was gladiator too. and it was like oh this. guy's gladiator too this guy's a gladiator too um but like not even. a prequel so then and also and also you want timothy sheldon. he better be the bad. guy the guy wears more [ __ ] sparkles than any chick. i've ever met he's not. going to be the russell crowe part. right gladiator could only be played by a guy. who you know is going. to be fat when he's 60. you know. what i'm talking about uh what's his name's gonna get timothy chalamet. is going to get thinner he's going. to be willing to. foe and [ __ ] when he gets older. only way more handsome now. i get william to. vote sexy he's got his own. [ __ ] going on but you know he wears sparkles and [ __ ] so uh uh anyway this guy is going to. play gladiator in glad here too. really scott's going to. do it so that'd be good look. at these [ __ ] guys dress um so apparently timothy chalamet's. agent brian swordstrom which is a [ __ ] name that would be in a movie and tom cruise would play the la the the [ __ ] anthony swordstrom would be the [ __ ] tom cruise guy and um quick he quickly entered the conversation to. refute the viral rumors now first of all this. is what the agent wrote. i know one of these actors was shooting a film. because they were saying who's going. to play the role. in and there was like is it. tiffany is it this guy and this guy his agent. to the shopping said i know. one of these actors was shooting a film. in the middle east for the past. several months and he hasn't auditioned for anything. in more than seven. years he tweeted now. the fact that your agent tweets. anything is terrible and about you. starable that was that is a fireable offense. if i was timothy chalamet i'd put on my sparkly. [ __ ] blazer and tweet back you're fired. okay and with a little [ __ ] tie that like you know the little tie. not even the bow tie. the one with the two things. that come down like a [ __ ] so because brian's tweet now hello an agent. has entered the chat now. what do we all know. about agents everyone hates them. no matter what so hey agent. don't tweet about me. i'm all good so his tweet. sparked a mixed reaction from fans. many of whom thought timothy's industry connections. into uh who brought timothy's industry connections. into question the 27. year old uncle is director rodman flender remember him. remember rodman flender huh. no ah then why is this. an article while his maternal grandfather. was writer and screenwriter harold. flinder oh that's why. it sounded familiar it wasn't rodman flender it was harold. flender right no you still don't. know oh right then why is this. article written dude and timothy's mom nicole. flender is also an actor known for. her roles in movies the bird. watcher and the heat of passion. how many times you see in those. movies zero oh okay. then why is this an article dude. it says given that timothy by. the way e e you. know with an accent. over the first e who shot. to fame after starring in the first film. yet come by your name question. whether it's a success in. the industry is supposed. to do their familiar connections. i got your answer right. here no okay i mean no. dude and for this reason. several fans argued that timothy not partaking in any. auditions in several years was. proof of his privilege in the hollywood. industry he's got privilege in the hollywood. industry because he's slaying these parts. he's got clout in the industry because he's absolutely obliterating his. choices and scripts he's out there. picking up i mean it's so look somebody some asian. chick wrote this is not the flex. you think it is look. at this hollywood is giving him. special treatment chalamet is a nepo baby. but a lot of people don't know that. because but he has an uncle in the industry that opened a lot of doors. for him dude how about like everybody. dude how about how their how about how every industry you j. look my dad is a producer. okay people think that literally people like my comedy. because my dad worked on ally. mcbeal do you know. what i'm saying people think that literally fans. buy tickets to my shows. because my dad directed a few episodes. of lois and clark like they think that you know. how hard it is dude. this is the industry that we grew up. in and i say we me and timothy telling me. because we're both [ __ ] complete we have star power. you know the same and you know it's like yeah he was in dune. but did he [ __ ] does he have a sold out. show in seattle i mean. he doesn't you know. what i mean i'd like to. see him try to. stand up is all i'm saying. like yeah i get it. he was in [ __ ] whatever that movie was uh uh call me by your name. and you know that was great. but i'd like to. see him go try to. do two shows at the beacon. on february 15th chrisley dot com. um so i don't think you would do very and obviously honestly. even if you could sell tickets. i don't think he would do very well. so and that's fine. but i'm saying put me in his roles i'll clean up. i'll clean up and it's not i'm not saying. you know i i i get it. but you put i'm not trying to. say one's better than. the other but you put me in dune. and it's a different story i mean. i know a lot of people liked it. but you put me in doing it's a different. story dude and i mean people go like this. okay wow all right. well yeah he's a force to. be reckoned with i know. i'm not going to. say it's a [ __ ] what do they call it tour. de force but so all i honestly. it's my gold address. like timothy chalamet though 100. when i'm 60 though when i'm 60. um so anyway you know it's like look at this. person tweets they're a real. conversations to be had about white. privilege but timothy shadow may not audition for. roles right now isn't this. is where this is where he is. in his career he's not. the first act to. be in the position i won't. be the last yeah for sure. 100 who said that. um i kind of if i was timothy shall. i might do i would be so angry. at my age and her age. and shut up you know. uh so anyway uh that's there you have it. dude it's not because of nepotism. dude the guy's a good actor i guess. right he massages the lens i'll give them. that much is he good i don't know. or is he massaging. the lens you know. i've seen a few movies. with timothy chalamet maybe only one and he massages the lens. i'll give him that much um but yeah i mean. it's just insane these people don't get mad. at [ __ ] anything how about this get mad at frankie muniz for being a nascar driver that shouldn't have happened in this world right now i've met frankie muniz the nicest guy in the [ __ ] world want the best for him but dude i want you to. be agent cody banks i want. you to do 11. of those movies i want. you to do more malcolm. in the middle i want malcolm. to not only be in the middle. i want him to. be on the left and the right. like dude i want honestly. what's his name frankie. muniz to be i mean. the guy's four six and i think that that's [ __ ] fantastic. man i want you to. play always in movies. i want you to. be bad guys i want you. to be the illest james. bond villain how about that. oh my god i'll tell you right. now frankie muniz if he was a james bond villain game. over so he does nascar he didn't want. to do acting and uh frank. commune is known as malcolm stars. starts nascar career look at. this there might be a reboot. on the horizon for actor frankie. muniz one aptly titled malcolm in. the middle of a pile up. sabad not funny i'm munich has started malcolm. in the middle and agent. cody banks announced that. he was that this week. he's competing in a fulltime. race car and driver. in the he's going to. die you know like and here's the deal. that because that makes so much sense. that headline frankie muniz dies. first car nascar race. like you know it just makes too much. sense i think he misses calling he should have. been a jockey dude. that would have been amazing. but it's probably good for lighter. guys to do nascar. [ __ ] because they don't have although maybe it's good to. have the weight you know because once you get the velocity. going i'm really [ __ ] i know a lot about science. and [ __ ] and math. uh and it all comes. down to velocity um. anyway congratulations to frankie munoz to. do his first race. we love frankie muniz here. at the congratulations podcast i love frankie. munoz i like him more than timothy channel. i mean honestly i wish frank. munoz was in doing um how confusing is that. title call me by your name call. me by your name call me. by your name is that what the movie is call. me by your name yeah. also oh wait hold on. timothy chalamet his sister. is also in the business. dude any business any business. you do is mostly a [ __ ] because you're like oh i know that. guy well why don't you hire this guy so and then when it comes. to hollywood everyone gets. all pissed off because everyone wants to. be in hollywood and people think it's because they're brown. or something or a lesbian. that they didn't get the part. we're gonna realize you just don't know. anybody and i don't you know. what i mean like if that's not that. doesn't come from my place. i hate i'm just saying i might have to. cut that part out we're not we're not cutting. that part out so um because i'm real. um i'm just honestly happy. at hey we talked about a lot. about movies we're going. to talk more about movies. i got a question for hollywood. hey hollywood what you doing. hey hollywood let's talk about this. 80 for brady hey hollywood. what you doing i want to. know 80 for brady it's a movie. about four women that are a hundred and eleven. that are tom brady. fans and want to. go watch football games okay. is basically what it is. that's the law that's the line. that they pitched um for sure. so here it is we open. up four 125 year olds. females love tom brady. the guy from [ __ ] lionsgate or whatever. is like i'm interested. and um not lions game. but you know what i mean.
