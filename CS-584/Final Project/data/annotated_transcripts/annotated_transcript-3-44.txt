[ __ ] okay but i like to. think the way i did. it right it had us making sure. that it was going. to be great all right. well we're chilling we're having a good. time here uh we're downtown la that's where we do. it and we were in downtown l.a and i stopped to. get a [ __ ] coffee bean. and teal if you know how i do and um i uh i got down to. the i got down to. the coffee bean tea. leaf i saw about three people on the street. and when i saw them they all said hi. to me and that's very weird. and the only thing i know about that. so here's the thing if somebody says hi. to you you're walking down. the street anywhere yeah then nice people right. if you're downtown l.a that's how you know. they're crazy yeah i mean everybody's crazy. downtown late night no but it's sad. though it's actually sad. it's definitely sad it's. also it's just [ __ ] it's never ending. so like you get sort of jaded. by it anybody that asks you for anything you're just like nah. nah right no whereas normally. you i at least i am open. to giving people [ __ ] but every [ __ ] half block somebody's coming up. asking me for something it's usually. an autograph usually no picture. with me in it. no no usually [ __ ] whatever a kiss on the forehead. wow the the [ __ ] pope so yeah i'm the pope. speak of the pope i've been watching the tudors. [applause] why are you clapping about you watching i've been watching the tutors i saw a [ __ ] five episodes in two nights. and how is it does. kristen like it she watched. the beginning of the first episode. and then was on tick. tock and then went to. bed and then the second night. she didn't want to. do it because she went. to bed no i'm pissed. dude but it's all good. i did [ __ ] spin move back. downstairs watch the whole. thing and i'm down [ __ ] watch it and watch it instead of her watch it with her i'll watch it with a friend wow you watch the tutors with a friend yeah dude you have mental problems. well no it's good you know. why it's good and i'll tell you this. okay here's the deal i get it's not very it's not as thoughtprovoking. as it as a show like that. should be okay but i i wondered why. it's it's it's just it's watchable. first of all like jonathan is. it jonathan reese and rhys myers. yeah he is so obviously. not henry viii it's unbelievable. and i heard that he was like i'm going. to do the part and then wouldn't put on the fat. suit and wouldn't dye his hair. oh dude i hate this. which sucks but also it's like who cares. if they look like the people in history i guess. it adds to. it you agree no i fully agree. oh you do fully agree. that it doesn't matter what they look. like when people get so caught up. in like with rey with jamie foxx. and i was like he looks just like him. anthony hopkins and nixon he looks just like who gives a [ __ ] they're acting i know me i know i spend your [ __ ] disbelief exactly. exactly let me know the other thing. i hate right now. i'm not a crook the other thing. i hate though is the is. when when there's like a let's say it's an uh an american. movie but it takes place. in france and all the american. or english actors do a [ __ ] french accent. 100 agree with that a hundred percent. just either do it in french. or don't [ __ ] bother. do it in french honestly. or honestly no accent yeah. or even just pick an accent. i don't give a [ __ ] it's better. than just they didn't speak in french. accents they speak they spoke in french. be a [ __ ] boston dude yeah and be like oh i think that the tiger got him yeah that would be good yeah like in [ __ ] gladiator if it was just like some dude that was just like oh from fargo right yeah that'd be good too oh oh oh one of the gladiators died so any accent as long as it's not the place where they're actually like taking place yeah like do like be joaquin phoenix and go like this when when you want to. kill a guy do that. okay do that in this. oh no oh he died. eh right okay oh no it's like an armenian person so i watch the tudors and the only reason why i watch that show is because eric griffin keeps telling me okay about this scene where there's a guy whose job it is to. catch how do we not get [ __ ] age. restricted for this or demonetized. to catch the king's um spillage when he uh yeah. and he just sits there. with a when he does the kumjabi. thing and he goes like this. and then over he goes like this. and he goes like this. and folds it and he leaves. that's his whole role. that's his job worst role. worst acting real role of all. time you know oh yeah i was in the tudors. i played uh jonathan rhys. myers his [ __ ] kumjabi collector and come jobby dude it was a great experience uh yeah oh wow dude that's amazing just just this and it shows it shows you it like one one it shows one thing where you play the neighbor and according to. jim right and then one thing. where you're just like and then a doritos commercial. and jonathan and then jennison reese. myers was like ha ha. and you're just like thank you. [ __ ] quarterback thank you sir. and the next thing is the doritos commercial. where the bag is like spitting. and [ __ ] and you catch it yeah yeah yeah yeah oh wow best [ __ ] acting reel of all time yeah so um so yeah i'm watching the tutors and i'm [ __ ] hell into. it dude i mean i'm into. it i can't believe you're into. that you're always in the [ __ ] that's like really dumb for dumb. people i know but i but i think that it's actually like because here's the thing. when television or movies. try to be too. smart i'm [ __ ] out that's for dumb. people i think i think this is a better. version of game of thrones. there i said it but it's not similar. the tudors is based in a true. story in it there's no dragons. and [ __ ] i know that's why why are you comparing them because it is the same kind. of they walk they walk the same. and they talk the same. and [ __ ] okay and they yell at the same times. okay how many of us. everyone's [ __ ] each other how many episodes of game of thrones. have you seen three seasons really. yep guess how many dragons. i've seen you just like won. you just dropped a [ __ ] bomb. on yeah bombs man. didn't expect that so um well by the way. i was walking downtown before we get into. it i was walking downtown just today and another guy. one of the guys who said hi. another dude walked by me. and he was walking by and i was playing the parking. meter and he looked at. me and he just he looks at me. and he says i'm innocent. and kept walking that reminds. me when i used to. live in new york. i was chilling at. [ __ ] washington square park and i was just reading a book guy comes up to. me he's like kind of nervous. do you know where this. is going no i think he knows. this story though yeah yeah uh he walks up. to me and he's like he's just like uh hey and he's kind of like nervous. see me he goes hey and he kind of stumbles. on his words and then he stops stumbling on his words. and he finally says i have aids. oh yeah and i was just like oh that's not a good. icebreaker you know so i have aids. can i have some change all good. that you have aids but don't leave what are you. trying to do so i have aids. i was wondering if you have a representation. i'm an agent of hollywood. um no i think you just if i remember correctly i mean that kind of is. all i remember but uh i think he wanted. uh and we dated for a few months. and uh how was that yeah. so all right so you have too many. drinks and i'm dripped out and gold. and it's all good dude. right i know so um all right. let's do you want to. get into the show. or what sure we'll get into. the show go to. get your lifeline merch. we got it all we wore. it and we you saw it. with these mentality uh. coffee too all right. cool matt comfy a reggae artist. hey uh luke here from the uk. i love the podcast. and chris i love your podcast. as well uh so i just wanted a bit. of advice on me and my partner. we're emigrating to australia. in a couple months but in the meantime. we're moving back into. my parents and lived with my sister. and i just wanted a bit. of advice really you know. how we carry on. doing the horizontal yeah with them. two in the house there. was one time when i first brought my partner. back um i left my belt on the floor. and i had to make up. some story my mom fell for it. because you know your boy's got acting in his corner. he looks like nice so yeah. just a bit of advice. on how we keep it. uh keep it moving in the old. parents thanks guys david. brent um well i think jesus. man save the blasting for when your parents. are gone if possible and if you can't if they don't leave if there's no blastage. possible when you if there's no passage possible. when they're gone right a professor. i think that what you need to. do is tr is is have the quiet. blastage where it's like you kind of just like wow. tightlipped making sure it's just like the efforts. are contained and you're just doing it. slow you're not banging the bed. against the wall right because that's a big. one you're trying to. do the quiet blast out. from the wall yeah from the middle. of the room yeah only a [ __ ] in the middle of the room. yeah yeah exactly if that's the floor. that's a floor yeah if it's the ottoman that's the ottoman and don't leave your belt on the ground. so here we have save the blastage. right here we've saved. the batches for when the parents are gone if the parents are here we're gonna do quiet. blastage worst professor of all. time jet propulsion laboratories uh yeah dude. i think that um there's a lot. of crazy cool places. to do blastage though you could do car. blasted you could do [ __ ] yeah actually maybe in a motel are there motels in britain i don't know try to. do the blessed outside. the house if they're always at the house. you know yeah illegal but yeah or or watch. like if you have a tv. in your own room watch it. real loud right right. but don't watch sex scenes. because then it'll sound like it's you know. like watch like [ __ ] saving private ryan you know wow sad blastage right. right right right you're the same. guy that he shot him in the first place. wait you're kidding me he let him. live and then he shot him. what that's crazy it came. back around ah oh this. is my favorite part when the guy. stabs him when he's laying right. over him looks them. right in the eye oh dude. imagine saying that yeah wait. a minute is that vin diesel. that's the guy from fast. and furious who are here he. comes just a minute mum. no mama just watch and save him. private ryan oh that guy's looking for his. arm isn't he um so yeah. dude i think that that's what you do. you save the blasters for when the parents. ain't home because the parents got to. leave the parents got to. leave don't they they do sometimes. well i mean yeah i mean i guess. if they're old which they probably are because he's not it's not. like he's you know he's i mean. he's obviously at least in his late. 20s they're below 75 based on the way. he looks so so but that when they get older. and older the parents stay. there but the good thing. about that is they lose. their hearing so they lose. their hearing and then blast away. but also you're an adult. so you deserve you reserve. the right to. participate in blastage whenever. you want here's the other here's the other thing. too you cannot get kicked. out because you're already moving anyway so you can pretty much do what you want right. and if they say we don't want you. to be blasting in here. we don't care if you're listening. to [ __ ] saving private ryan it's absolutely manzo and then they'll be like well mom guess what we're moving to. australia anyway come on partner. let's go back in yeah. let's watch [ __ ] whatever that movie is with paul rudd. and tom hanks what's that. the [ __ ] uh the one that came out the spy one that came out recently bridge of spies. maybe yeah there's tom yeah tom hank. you know hank is in it. tom hanks cause only one. of them isn't it tom hanks. not all the tom hanks so. um all right cool all right. yeah that's okay cool. we got it we figured it out. thank you here we go. what's up matt what's up. chris jack coming from chicago. got a question for you so i've been seeing this. guy i'm a gay. baby and i've been seeing this. guy and we've been on like five. or six dates we always have fun. on the date he's dope. i want to. see where it goes. yeah but he's starting to. become a bit of an excessive texture. okay i'm getting a text. right when i wake up. i'm getting a text at. 11 am i'm getting a text. at 2 p.m 5 p.m and it's like i work. fulltime i kind of got to. stay focused during the day. and also i just like want to. not talk sometimes so how do i break. it to him. that i like him but you know. i i can't be doing this. all day texting let me. know i know how to. do it i know how to. do it just say you don't. even need to say that. say uh sometimes i can't text. even if i want to. i'm at work i don't see. the text or i have to. read it and then respond. later so you can be like you can make you can frame. it like you don't mind. the barrage of texts but you you you are. letting him know he won't be able. to respond all the time. so you're not making it personal. to him you're making it about you. and how often you're available to. text back i have a i have a great. oh boy no it's not if i ever. had a good idea a lot. of times we do silly. [ __ ] but this is for real bro. i think i have a good. idea you're known as a guy. who gives a good advice. whatever quote unquote vomit but like wow. so rude put your red receipt read read. read read receipts whatever. it is read receipts put your red receipts. on for him okay. this way he knows when you see the text. okay and tell him listen. i can't always respond. you know you text a bunch if that's your thing. i'm not always going to. be responding because i have to. work right and i'm obviously the [ __ ] you know you're acting like a girl i know you're a guy but you're acting like a girl right but don't say that okay but but i'm gonna put my red receipts on so you know when i get the res that this is out of respect you know i got it i saw it and i will respond when i can putting on the red receipts. is going to change the dynamic. oh i don't understand. because the guy's going to. [ __ ] see that he sent it. and that he read it. and he's going to. get used to. the fact that the guy. doesn't respond as soon. as he sees it and then he's going to. re because dude dude i mean i respond. to people sometimes [ __ ] eight hours. later oh dude i'm so bad i will sometimes. just not respond until. they text me again. and i'll be like oh right. you texted me before. like dude i'm so bad. at it also you could just have a conversation. and be like dude. the greatest thing about being gay. is we don't have to. deal with [ __ ] like this nobody's a straight girl guys don't give a [ __ ] dude i'm gonna i'm a dude and guess what we're we're we're chilling. we're gay we're missing out. by you texting me all the time. we're missing out on the best. part of being gay not having to. deal with the woman yeah well right. but super sounds really messed up. in the negative in the negative. way women are great. obviously okay but in the negative. ways that women are and a lot. of [ __ ] men are negative in a lot of ways. but we're not talking about that. right now we're talking about right. now you're acting like a woman. right the best part of being gay. is i don't have to. talk when i don't want to. dude we can just chill. okay and [ __ ] hang out watch saving private. ryan or whatever it. is and not have to. talk to each other bro. but what if this is a guy. who leans more to. the feminine in that way. obviously there are many men like that. yeah but then he's got to. find another dude that's going to. be more expensive that's not a [ __ ] deal breaker is it. texting a lot just be like look i don't text. that much that's it. okay if the other guy deals. with it nice then good well. that's what i'm saying then. it's on him that's a weird. problem to have if you're gonna be gay. you need to. be all the way gay. and still be a dude. and also [ __ ] be able to. be like look dude. we're we're bros at the. end of the day. we're bros now you. know what i mean whether you're top. or bottom it's all good maybe sometimes. on top sometimes on bottom maybe we mix it up. whatever it is i don't know. what your kink is. but one of the [ __ ] things that's a pro. about being [ __ ] gay is that we're dudes and we don't have to. [ __ ] do this [ __ ] all the time right yeah you don't have to. do this [ __ ] all the time yeah yeah okay well there you have it yes got out of that one who's a handsome guy. a guy yeah it was a good. looking guy i'm sure the [ __ ] boyfriend is a good. looking too okay. what do you guys. think about um do not disturb. things in general on the iphone. thing i have almost every single person. i know on do not disturb. yeah but that's still i never get alerts. on my phone anymore. i have to look at my phone. to get a text. that's good you know uh but no that. still doesn't save i mean. he could say i have my [ __ ] on do not disturb. i think he should let the guy. know all the reasons why he doesn't not that. he doesn't want a text. he should frame it as he doesn't see. text he's not good at texting. it takes him a while to. get back to certain texts all. that [ __ ] everything's short of you text. too much and stop it you know. i i also uh sometimes get like i'll wake up. in the morning i'll get eight. texts and i'll check them. and i because i'm hot hazy. and foggy yeah i don't even remember that. totally you do that too. yeah absolutely i always have more than eight. because i'm really popular but yeah no but i have eight. because i only sleep. for like an hour i listen. for an hour i'll wake up. i have eight but if i see for eight. hours i'll have almost 250. yeah i'll have like i have like two. 1600 i think it's like three hundred ten. hundred i think i have about three or eight. i'm honestly about four hundred i've had there's been a bunch. of times where i've had a thousand. i'll have like two two or three. thousand all right so all right. next one dude [music] you. want to read it. okay i mean i mean you know. i robots i female 21. oh okay i f21 and my boyfriend. m21 hi female 21 years old and my boyfriend mel 21. years old currently lived. together and have been together for about four. months to. explain why we are living. together at the four month. mark quick we started out. as roommates but then started dating. oh my god oh wow. okay i have to. say my boyfriend has never been good. at pet names oh. boy some early ones were little stubster. little stubster that sounds like a [ __ ] honestly that sounds like a sitcom. in the 80s with one. of those short black dudes that. never grew up and sour. meat dude this guy needs. to do this oh hi. sour meat that's just like a straight up boner. killer why would you do. that oh man. sour meat one of my nicknames for. him in comparison is little bird. that's a cute one. so sweet yeah yeah little bird. hi sour meat hey little bird hey [ __ ] [ __ ] mcgillicuddy anyway about two weeks ago. he starts calling me tony pizza. tony peter are you dating. what what this doesn't mean. this doesn't even make sense. and he uses it more. often than my actions this guy is an alien. masquerading as a human being he is. obsessed pet names like. tony pizza and sour. meat and also little substance honestly. bothers me that he can't even plan to. find a somewhat nice nickname. for me i have had a couple of conversations. with him about it but he says he just can't. think of anything better what do. i do is this going. to become a bigger problem. or should i even address. it i hate being tony pizza. i would hate being tony pizza. too you know what the best. i would love being tony pizza. dude are you [ __ ] your name was totally pizza was calling you tony. pizza as a pet name come. on i don't know man. it's kind of weird your name. was tony pizza that's cool. but this is a pet name. like a term of endearment from your loved. one no dude no no if you're having sex. with someone and all of a sudden you're like yo. i'm tony pizza right you can say it. about yourself but imagine a woman. saying it to. you hey come on down to. tony pizza's jeweler okay. jewelers hey come on down at the by the way you know the best part. about this is he used. to eat as a kid. tony's pizza remember tony's pizza yeah. he definitely has that that's why he's getting. that and he's calling her tony. pizza because when he was a kid. he would eat tony's. an association with it. yeah yeah what i think is you absolutely. have to address. it you have to. say look the names. you have for me are [ __ ] disgusting. and they make me feel disgusting. and you're stupid if you think they're good. wow you can't think of anything else other than little. stubster such a [ __ ] [ __ ] sad meat or whatever sour meat sad meat would be better. yeah sad meat what's happening. would be way better sour. meat is only disgusting. dude this guy sucks. dude break up with him. i want to. know who this guy is. very badly also he's 21. to. be [ __ ] 21 and have that this guy's creative is [ __ ] honestly to. be able to. do that i mean dude. little little stubster is one thing. that's just sour meat. is incredible but tony pizza is. the most unreal [ __ ] name to. the remember we had

word his last name is bacon just a spicy food pizza yeah so wait hold on first let's go in order little stubster is [ __ ] rude no straight up but straight up it's ruth there is an argument that little stubster is kind of cute. in a way there's an argument it's like calling somebody a little chubby. boy little chubby that's kind of cute. no dude okay anyway sour meat. is just like yeah sour. meat is like a bad guy. in the cr in the [ __ ] comic books. tracy the spawn i said okay. so i was saying it's something a little slightly better. but it's okay that's okay so then you know it's sour. vacuum tony pizza is fine. but as as a pet name. for your [ __ ] girl tony pizza dude. it would also be dick. these are all dick. trees honestly these are all dick. crazy yeah yeah little stubster

adelaide. and i am a huge fan. so i want to. start with that um but i wanted to. ask you guys a question. so i'm super mixed always have been always will be and i've always had a problem. with how people address that. though oh like i've consistently walked up to. and asked things like what are you. or where are you from. or what are you mixed. with so i guess my question is like how do you respond. to people like that this is a daily. thing for me so any help. appreciated okay have a good one. i think for me whenever somebody. asks me where i'm from or like what. my ethnicity is i honestly. find those conversations so boring. that i think maybe a good thing. to do is just say. like like ask do do what. happens there hey what's going on where are you what. are you you're boring. but okay you're boring. me oh wow yeah are you black. or white boring me oh and then i'll stop yeah that's really i mean. it'll stop um i have to. be i have to. be honest so when i saw her. i thought wow she's like the most fifty. percent white and fifty percent. black like remember that seinfeld episode. where they couldn't tell if the person was white. or black no actually and they were like we don't know what it. is that's what and george. is like i can't tell [ __ ] what the [ __ ] he is you know this is exactly what's every episode. you know she can't yeah yeah but she yeah. and she even she's not doing. herself any favors by having a the blunt. the hair blonde but that's okay. though do what you want. live your truth but what is your truth. but that's what people want and also if you don't deserve. to know that whoops right. okay but they don't deserve to. know that unless she i don't know. is it a weird thing. to be like where are you. from it's annoying it is annoying. because you know here's the thing. when i saw her i thought wow i wonder what she is. oh you did yeah i did. yeah did you no it was the first. thing i thought but then i immediately thought she probably gets that all. the time yeah so i would not ask her. that at least from jump. yeah you never ask somebody. that here's the deal you never ask. somebody something that is clear. they get asked it. all the time right. like for me like dude. how big must your dick. be no that doesn't mean. they do do that. though that doesn't happen they go. like this yeah they say like dude. does it weigh down. on your test they go. does it weigh down. on your testicles and then the first time. when i was like what do you mean. oh my and they said because you're obviously and i go. okay yeah right that yeah. most conversations how they start for me. i'm gonna i don't think that happens. but it's okay you're not anything. that get the anything that anything that's obviously. asked of someone a lot. is going to annoy. them if you also ask it. curb your [ __ ] curiosity because we all know. that what the truth is. people ask because they want to. fill the [ __ ] air they don't actually have small [ __ ] really the worst they're not going to. remember when they walk away. so why ask the annoying. thing just don't [ __ ] ask. that in general people stop asking people that it's so boring. and annoying hmm who's excited to. be like yes somebody asked me. about my info white black and a little bit mexican. then you got to. tell them like it's not nobody. likes that you guys say you they. say what is where what are you. fro what are they what's the question. she gets what are you and then she says what's your favorite. movie and they say oh uh and they answer. and they say good now. we're both boring spinning out. that's good um now we're both born. we need to match. your boringness it's a good. move and so uh i think that uh yeah. i don't know man but yeah i think that it's just really good. it's one of you know. what dude it is it's one. of those things you got to. just [ __ ] sometimes charge to. the game though right. meaning well like it's just like the your thing. it's gonna suck man. it's just one of those things. you got to charge it. to the game that's gay. yeah or i guess you could answer. and just be so clearly like annoyed. about it just like that. yeah exactly dude exactly what i was mixed. i'm white and black my mom. and my my mom was white my dad. was black because it's never obviously the other way. around but yeah and then say you're happy. now like that are you are. you happy now yeah you know. i think that uh yeah i mean. that's what i do when people are like dude. is the top you. know does that is the top. of your penis no no but they're like is it. often raw and red and i'm. like why in the first beginning. i was like why and they're like because when you walk. forward obviously the top of it. drags on the ground behind you and i go no it's not actually i you know i make sure that i [ __ ] scoop it around my leg and i tie mine up so they're not facing out right and so they're like wow and then i go yeah and so that's how i that's how i combat that question but i still go like this when they go like this is your the top of your and i go right i wrap it and i cut them off as i wrap it around my leg and then go oh okay okay okay okay that's all good man that's just not what they were gonna ask. you when [ __ ] there's i wrapped my dick. around my leg i was gonna ask if the top floor. is 10 or 11. all. right cool now a word from our. sponsor better help how well would you take care. of your car if you had to. keep the same one. your entire life that's how our brains. work so why don't we treat them. that way therapy is something. that's near and dear to. my heart i mean this show is an advice. show but therapy is the real deal. when you have serious issues. serious problems anything in your life. that comes up you want. to talk to. a therapist i can't recommend. therapy more to anyone and everyone everyone should be in therapy. and i've even tried better. help and better help. is amazing it's great. because it's better help. is online therapy that offers. video phone and even live chat. only therapy sessions so you don't. have to see anyone on. camera if you don't even want. to it's just all for you. it's focused on you it's much. more affordable than inperson therapy. which is great and the cool. thing is you can be matched. with a therapist in under 48. hours which is really lightning quick. especially it's hard to. find one you know you a lot. of the time when you're on your own. and not online and not using better. help so that's why betterhelp is really great. yeah otherwise you get on a waitlist. it just takes forever. and ever this is the way. to go better help. our listeners get 10 off their first month at betterhelp dot com. lifeline that's better helpcom lifeline. so go on over there. and give it a shot. better help is uh is a really great. uh really great thing. to do here we go. let's do it and chris wow. what's up my babies going. skydiving my girlfriend and i i mean. what the [ __ ] is he wearing. my wife now he's a straight. jacket couldn't get his belt. out together for four years. look at his headphones. dude only one of them. is on it would be like his [ __ ] glasses are like this. hey what's up one. legging is shorts hey what's up. man uh my question is kind of obvious. how do you wear stuff. [laughter] all right go ahead. everyday i'm sure that's how every relationship. goes his hat isn't even on right. now like once a month. he's talking about having sex. yeah i know that's irregular for any young. couple but it seems to. me like she's falling out. of sexual attraction i'm. so comfortable talking about anything. this guy yeah i want to. know what you might think of what that reason. is the most comfortable kite reason. for that right all right. about anything oh who's this. [ __ ] this guy's the shirt oh my god i've never seen somebody more comfortable in his own. skin talking about anything because he's talking. about his sex life. and he's on like they were they were like his friend. was like do you want to. blur your face out and he. literally goes like this. why would i do that. yeah right yeah but the thing. is that when she's gonna rest your clothes what. do you mean i'm putting on half. of it it's definitely not. that she's not attractive anymore. because the way you are being dude. literally you could be a [ __ ] one yeah this guy cleans it up. yeah if you're if you're that. confident it just doesn't matter what. you look like uh but let's say that. you need to. know the answer i think they're just like most. things there's a way to. ask that without being like hey why don't you want. to [ __ ] anymore for instance. right how do you how like is there. something i could be doing more. like i feel like we used to. have more sex is our. passion dwindling if it is what can i do like recharge. it like what what what are. the things that you need uh and then once the conversation's. going your partner will eventually. tell you the deal you know. like if you make it a safe place. for her to say whatever. she will tell you the thing. if they're look it's totally possible. that it's nothing her sex. drive just has waned there's nothing to. do with him yeah but like if it if there is an underlying reason. that uh she's sort of nervous. about sharing i think opening. up a space like that. communication that kind of [ __ ] she'll be able to. have a safe zone to. say that [ __ ] oh man that's incredible. i just can't believe how i honestly. think that guy's the most comfortable. guy i've ever seen in my life. he's comfortable he would just walk up. to his wife and just be like [music]. in front of her. family what are we doing doinking. why don't we donk why don't we have sex. here here's the deal i don't. know if you guys know but uh we don't have sex. much wow um hey mom at thanksgiving. hey hey her mom and hey her dad yeah. anyway can you pass. the gravy maybe once a month. it's all good but past me. half the gravy i'll only use half. of it what what what is. your advice dude you i mean. here's i have advice which is similar. to yours but i also think that this. kind of stuff just comes. and goes in waves like i have a lot. of old friends that have been married. for a long time and they're like yes sometimes you go. a year and it's not good. sometimes you go two years is not good sometimes. you go a month it's not good. but then you go and you have like a string. of [ __ ] months or a year that's just great. it's true you know it's part. of commitment it's part of being with somebody. it's part of uh marriage. you know and uh and i just think that right. now you're in one of those. moments you know sometimes the shirt's half. on you know as they say. as john lennon said john. lennon said sometimes your hat's. tipping off the back of your head. and you're only wearing one headphone yeah the headphones. thing was what did it. also what was around your chest. also where was he was like i think he fell out. of a plane hit the ground. and immediately started recording the video. dude [music] so my wife. it's all good but we don't have. sex we have it like once. so basically what do i do. and then he went and then he stopped recording. and he just goes oh my god i didn't realize how much pain he's right. he broke his back. you know uh so wait i think the one. other thing i want to. say before we move on. is i don't think you should be. assuming don't exactly bringing up. with her that it's some kind of attraction. level thing it's not good i'm telling you right. now dude okay but but it's not a good. assumption to make no it's not bad. it's not good to. make any assumptions yes but that's just that one is specifically bad because it'll [ __ ] change the way you're directing it and it'll make him resentful and be [ __ ] weird and that'll make it even worse whatever's going on yeah so um yeah don't assume anything honestly ever yeah really yeah okay all right cool next one next one next one hey guys um my question is is it ever okay to. move on after your spouse. passes away my fiance passed away in. december and i get a lot. of people telling me that. like they hope that i move. on and i find somebody else someday um but like i just don't feel like that's appropriate. um like his family doesn't get to. replace him so like what. gives me the right. so i'm just wondering like what your take would be. and if you were in my shoes. what would you do. oh and if you are going. to move on what's the appropriate. length of time before you move on thanks. here's the deal first of all that's terrible. and i'm so [ __ ] sorry that that happened that's unimaginable and just my heart goes out to. you and and his family um as far as moving on i don't think that you should put a hard and fast. rule on yourself about. that if you don't feel like doing it. then you definitely should not if you start feeling. like doing it you gotta lose. this idea that it's inappropriate. it's not inappropriate unless you feel. that deeply on the inside. but don't there's no rule. that says you know it's inappropriate. until x amount of months or whatever. years uh that's just not it's not a fair. way to treat yourself uh. but and i also think that the thing. that you mentioned about his family. doesn't get to replace. him but but you know and so neither should you. i don't really agree with that. because i don't think that you know. when you have a child um do you have either. that just that child or more. children and you're right they are irreplaceable as that individual. child but people all the time. get married and divorced. have long relationships that end. amicably often and so i think that you should give yourself the leeway. the the bottom line is sadly he is. gone and you are still here. and i think because of that. and i think he would say this. too and i i mean. i'm assuming even his family. would agree you deserve to. be happy in this one. life that you have so i don't think you should put some hard. and fast rules on. yourself for you're not allowed. to you shouldn't do it. it would be a bad thing. to do it's not a bad thing. to do if you don't feel like doing it. then don't but don't make yourself not do it. because of some rule that. you perceive to be some kind of moral code. it's don't put that on yourself. it's enough that your fiance has passed away. that is plenty don't add to. your troubles yeah don't i mean. she's asking when is an appropriate. amount of time there is. no appropriate amount of time. it's whenever you feel like i think that like your parents. or hurt their parents was it. their parents or i think she's talking. about the history yeah yeah i mean it's tough man. i mean i i don't know what the right. uh answer for it is i don't imagine. it's easy at all i'm really sorry. that this happened um i think it's just a slow. process that's very you know. you take your steps as you can. and hopefully it feels okay. when it does and if it does then. that's a some sort of a blessing. in your life i you know. it's i don't think there's any real. answer here you're right that there's no right. answer but there i believe that. there is a wrong answer. and that wrong answer would. be that you can absolutely never. move on that is not fair. to yourself and again. you're you remain you have a life. and you need to. live it that doesn't mean. get back out there it's time. to move on that. is [ __ ] and anyone that's sitting there telling you you have to. move on come on get pull pull yourself. up by the bootstraps get yourself. out of bed that's horseshit. if it takes you six months. 18 months [ __ ] five years it. doesn't matter but at some point. if you start to. feel like getting back out there. and maybe meeting someone do it. absolutely just do it do. not hold yourself back. because of some perceived morality that you feel. like you need to. put up put on yourself. that that's not that's not fair. to you and also just objectively it's not right. it's not right i get that. you would feel that way. though it's it's a heartbreak and you're probably emotionally. just [ __ ] crushed and it's gonna take a minute but don't add to. the to the troubles. yeah that makes me sad. i don't um i don't have much. to add to. that i mean i don't even. know what i would do i think it's just um and i think you know sorry. but his family is one. thing but they're going through. a different thing i'm sure there. are online communities of people who have lost romantic. intimate partners uh suddenly or not so suddenly it. doesn't matter but before their time. you know you're still very young. uh so i think that give yourself all. the time that you need but also maybe seek out. people who have gone through. similar things i know. just from firsthand experience that. obviously this hasn't happened to. me but other things that have been traumatic. finding other people who have gone through. the exact same thing. who understand it in their version. but understand it in a broad. way maybe hearing their stories or even just like reading. about their stories you don't even. need to talk to. these people if you don't want to. uh could really sort of help. a lot i think yeah you know. yeah my heart goes out. to you man. i'm i'm i'm sorry to. hear that it's brutal. but we love you. and uh take care of yourself. first and foremost matt. you are much better. looking than chris okay. well i've been running. for years he looks like his way. of getting rid of stress and anxiety. and like decompressing and like it's my outlet. that's what i do there's this. family in my neighborhood that um when they see me. running they turn the little fiveyearold loose. and a little fiveyearold tries. to come out of the street. and play tag with me. when i'm doing my sprints. and like i'm not a babysitter. like this has been going on. for months i started off. really nice you know i'd wait. for the kid to. get tired and try and finish. up my run later but like the kid. is like it sticks around. for longer and longer now. i've let the charade go on. for so long i tried. to be too nice. about it and now i'm at this. point where i don't know them i can't set. that boundary because i don't know. them but this kid comes. out in the middle of street and i'm babysitting. while i'm working out like it's so stupid. get out of my stupid. face do i need to. perform like spin moves or something. like do i need to. throw like hot flaming toilet. paper balls in there yes i don't know. i was gonna say that. i was gonna say that. that'd be weird if yeah. that would be weird if you were gonna say that. i mean he's running. by and they do this he said he's got a workout routine. that involves him running. back and forth past. his neighbor's house and when the fiveyearold sees. this happen yeah he is loosed upon. this poor guy put him in the [ __ ] work get him uh you know what i mean. working out have him go. into your house and take care. of like do the dishes. make your bed whatever. the [ __ ] like put this [ __ ] away yeah it's so that's so annoying. it's annoying yeah i mean. like i you know it's it's not it's it's one. of those things that's annoying. but it's like cute. the kid's cute so you're like oh [ __ ] but the parents are annoying right yeah but are they watching him because if they're not watching him then you should have a conversation with the parents. and be like yo i'm trying. to work out and i don't know if this. kid you know i'm gonna run. into your kid. i don't want your kid. to get hurt i'm working out. you know i push [ __ ] crazy weight. you know make up whatever the [ __ ] he said the parents are setting the kid loose yes exactly. so you got to. go over there and knock on the door. and say hey look your kid's fine. i don't mind him being out. here when i am but like obviously it's a [ __ ] free. country do what you want but you can't leave him with me i don't give a [ __ ] about your kid right and i just want you to. let you know yeah yeah. i'm not gonna watch him. yeah so if anything bad happens. guess whose fault it. is right only yours. i'm not watching you i'm not watching a kid. i got weights that. i'm moving around i don't want your kid. to get in any any sort of pain. so you got to. keep an eye on your kid. if if i'm running by your house. on the street it's not your property. right i'm [ __ ] you know what i mean. and keep running don't stop just keep running. they're doing the thing where they're just like. ah yeah he'll watch him. you know what i mean. if i'm doing some [ __ ] inside or yeah. you know the kid he's not always gonna. let the kid get taken. no right well i think that's the thing. you need to. be clear if your kid. gets kidnapped i'm just gonna let it happen. i'm not doing anything i'm not watching this. kid it's not my responsibility. i don't know where you got the [ __ ] idea in your head. that it is but this is not my [ __ ] thing i'm just letting you know i'm not watching your kid. and and i'm not just not watching because i'm oblivious i'm purposely. not watching your kid. i don't want to. do that i'm working out not [ __ ] babysitting. like dude there i understand. he doesn't want to. set the boundary because he doesn't know. him but they're being crazy. rude and irresponsible well it's just they're probably. just got their head up their ass. you got to be like dude. i don't know if you've heard about the zone. but when i work out i get in that and i can't [ __ ] see [ __ ] around that so if your fiveyearold's running around playing with my weights he's gonna get hurt. and i'm in the zone dude. so it's not gonna be my fault. you don't want your kid. to die because i'm in the zone. it's about him like running. off getting into some other thing. right right you don't want your kid. to get taken because i'm in the zone. yeah okay but just blame it. on the zone i'm just saying dude. the [ __ ] you know i don't know you know the husband's probably out of shape. she'd be like your husband's out. of shape he's probably never or very rarely. been in the zone he probably. hasn't been in the zone since high. school i live in that zone. right when i'm out here with the zone. yeah i live in that. when i'm running back and forth. that's exactly where i am. and guess who's not in the zone. anyone else for your kid. definitely but anyone else so. familiarize the parents with the zones. step one first and then be like watch your kid. let them know that you inhabit. the zone step three let them. know their kid will never inhabit. the zone and therefore this is not gonna work. i mean the kid. might be in the zone. but he's not gonna be in my zone. he's gonna grow up. and be in his own. zone well he'll grow up. eventually being his own. zone but nobody's in any zone at five right. there you go except like the [ __ ] of your pants. educate them about the zone the [ __ ] your pants. is on right that zone. is something that kids do but educate. them about the zone and then also say look you know that's not gonna all right. okay good cool so basically uh this. one's another written one so basically a good. buddy of mine is seriously dating. a friend of my sister hold on. a second a good buddy. of mine is seriously dating a friend. i can't ever do this. hold on so a good buddy. of his is seriously dating. a friend of mine sister. i was like i get it. it's like steven vecchio wow i mean. i'm taking them all the way. back i'm dating laura in the vecchio. current friends but okay uh her and my sister are part. of my guy's friend group. of six dudes i recently found out that. his girl went on a date. with someone else behind his back. because her dad forced her. to that's in quotes. by the way i only found out from my sister. and i swore i wouldn't tell him. if i tell him i essentially ruined. my sister and hurts friendship because my sister. wasn't supposed to. tell anyone and then there's beef with me and my sister and her and my sister and the holy christ. the whole tris group is. gonna be affected okay that's not a word. oh but all i know is if i wrote a group. triangle i mean i don't know. whatever the [ __ ] but all i know is if i were in his position. i would need to. know this makes me so mad because my guy has no idea. and plans to marry her. i want to. tell him so bad but i don't know. what the right thing to. do is uh i think you have to. do of i need you need to. get to her somehow whether that's through. yourself or you don't. want to blow up. your sister's spot and you want. to maybe make your sister. say to her friend. hey this guy's really serious. about you and we're all like a really tight. friend group i'm not gonna say. anything but i think you need to. like he's gonna try to. he's gonna keep pursuing this and wants to. turn into something lifelong. like he needs to. know and i think that you need to. talk to him. about this tell him. about this give her the option. to it's never good to. be like hey dude your [ __ ] girl's cheating on you you want to. talk to the girl first and give her the chance to. do it well they they went. out they hung out because the dad wanted them. to whatever that's all about that's in quotes. i think he's implying that he doesn't believe it. oh okay i got you okay. and then that that's all that happened. she went on a [ __ ] date with someone else is what happened yeah how old are they that's a that definitely you know i mean it sounds like they're like [ __ ] 19. it sounds yeah they sound like they're in their late teens honestly i agree so like he wants to. marry her but also she's not gonna marry. her anyway you know what i mean. just let it play out. i think maybe start talking [ __ ] about her too to. him to your friend. wait who the guy that's writing should. talk to his friend and be like ah dude. i know you're gonna marry her. i don't know if that's a good. idea you know yeah maybe i don't know. i mean you don't that. is a bad spot yeah. but you run the risk of saying. hey look dude you know uh if you involve yourself. you will run the risk. of ruining your friendship with the dude. the guy could be like [ __ ] off this and that you know. what i mean you don't need to. be too forceful about it. i know i don't know i know obviously. they'll be forceful no matter what but like you run. the risk of getting involved and then having it backfire on you it. could totally be the kind of thing. where it's just like i mean. dude if it was uh a hangout and that was just that oh wait i got the advice. okay but i got the advice. the advice i got the advice. the advice is this tell your sister. you need to. talk to your friend and confront her. about this and tell her that. she needs to tell my friend. who she's dating that she dated. someone else behind his back. hold on hold on. hold on tell your sister. there's so many i can't do this. dude see that's pissing me. off because it's it's so hard. okay do it again. say it i i'm suggesting. that this guy talked to. his sister okay who's friends. with the cheater okay and the cheater told his sister. that he can't that she can't. tell anybody and she told the guy. that wrote in okay so he's not supposed. to know so he needs to. talk to the sister. and say talk you need to. talk to your friend or else. i'm going to and that. can't happen because the sister is going. to say no you can't do that. and you're going to. say well you better then because i'm going. to if you don't do it. so you're forcing the sister. to confront her friend. who's the cheater about cheating okay and then so you don't get. involved exactly i see what you're saying. and then the threat over her. head is jesus christ i'll. [ __ ] i'll do it if you don't and that'll make you look bad to. your friend okay so then she's gotta [ __ ] talk to. her friend about cheating and then she's gotta confront her. and then so that he can be confronted.

[ __ ] honestly here's what you say uh it's easier for a woman toward a man. at the gym because the the thing. that is the biggest nono. ever at the time it's just not. gonna yeah the other way. around is still kind of dicey but it's not. nearly as [ __ ] bad yeah but anyway uh i think in the elevator next time you see him make like a f she's cute. and she's being cute. and laughing at herself. take that same exact. vibe and say oh this is so weird. but you know i didn't want. to do it inside. the gym but we always run. into each other here and i thought why not just tell you like i actually have like a crush on you. and it's silly but i just want to. let you know and like maybe you want. to hang out sometime that would be no. that's like [ __ ] oldfashioned [ __ ] just be like yo what's up how you doing my friends and i are going to. be somewhere why don't you come. meet up with you and your friends. don't like it why. though playing it too cool. she got to. be honest and earnest her. vibe is the honest and earnest. cute thing yeah i know. but she doesn't seem to. be alluring and [ __ ] like she can't be like i have a crush on you that's like because the guy's gonna be like got this you need to. be the guy you need to. make the guy be like oh that. was cool that was that was an interesting. situation huh what's that girl. all about you can't play all your cards. bro [music] you can't play all your cards. uh i think what i said. is great if you want to. take a bigger chance do what. i said if you want to. play it all cool and [ __ ] do what he said no. don't play it it's not about playing. it cool it's about getting the guy. to be intrigued with it. all right maybe don't say crush but be like oh man. like i feel like we run. into each other a lot. of times on the elevator uh i feel like maybe i don't know. yeah be cute and [ __ ] don't be like cool yeah no i'm not saying be cool. but be like yo um hey i uh uh i see you here. all the time you you should get some friends. i'm meeting my friends because you don't even know if you like the guy yet. you just have a crush she likes. him but you don't know. though the guy could be like [ __ ] terrible and at which point. she could hang out with him. for an hour and leave and i know if you meet up. with friends if you say my friends are coming you should come and then you know if he shows up he's kind of interested i think that that's a move okay well you just say look my friends are hanging out with this at this place come with your friends if you want if he shows up then you know he's interested if he doesn't then maybe he still is but still you know that you've got the gym and you could see him all the time yeah i think yeah i mean i think we disagree on this one that's not the worst thing you think i should say hey i notice you you have you know i think you're cool we should hang out sometimes oh she should be like oh i'm kind of like embarrassed and i would never do this at the gym but like we run into. each other time and i don't know i just i thought you were cute. maybe we could like go. get a coffee sometimes. you would like that oh yeah. dude just straight honesty and not creepiness. always the best if she can pull that. off yeah but that's very hard to. pull off but if she all she needs. to do is take the vibe. that she took to. that video okay that's it. is she saying the gym. is in their building. i don't know i'm confused. by that too i thought i thought maybe she meant. the elevator is just at the gym. but i didn't think i could sing the elevator at. their building building and she sees. them at the gym oh. then you could say and honestly. the best thing is that the gym. in the building the gym. in the elevator and my apartment are the same. place if we end up hitting it. off we could live still. live here and we could always be together. yeah well that now that would be bad. that's something that you like to. say probably that would be a robot. all right cool well look that's what we have for. this uh this this today um if you have a question. then go to watchlifeline dot com. and also you can get the lifeline. merch on my website or the other website that we have for lifeline. uh which is what watch lifeline. dot com and get the lifeline. merch dot com lifelinemerch.lifelinemerch dot com yes so that's that and uh and that's it. and leave your comments on. what you think the advices. should be in the in the comment. and then subscribe to. super cold studios we really appreciate. it and subscribe to. also the clip channel that would be great. we got super cool clips. thank you very much you guys. you rock yeah we love you yeah. hello [music]
