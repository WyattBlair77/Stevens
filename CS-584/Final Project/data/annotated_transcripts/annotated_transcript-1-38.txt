say is i won't say there. there are no words but i will say. i'm too dumb to. actually find the words and construct. the sentence to express my gratitude. because i mean it. man just for the we're filming. this two days after the special came out guy. stopped me on the street and he was like dude. the special and and i go like this. and it was about 6. seconds until he said the next word. and i was like i don't know how this is going. to go he goes. the special and i i just stood there like a dumb. dumb because these days people. will say anything and i i waited. i was in the parking. lot and then i finally went like this. and he says it's fire. man it is so good. i mean they're all good. this one uh he said uh i just thank you. thank you he said and dude. and i went in my car. and i sat there for a little bit like i was in a movie. and i just had a a little bit of a moment. so anyway dude whatever i'm trying to. express my gratitude but i'm too. dumb to have the words. to say it and construct a sentence. so i appre pre pre all you um cy. dot com anyway uh i'm good. i'm feeling good i'm i'm having a good. time haven't worn the shirt. in over a year decided to. put it on just throw it. on and uh you know. give it a give it a whirl. again dude how about how it is when you find a shirt. that you used to. wear and you go huh. what a you're so dumb. dude when you're going through. your closet you go. oh yeah that one. and you go huh. and you throw it on you're like huh. and then you walk outside. and you feel good and you're just like huh. all right huh. and nobody notices but you you know. but you're just like yeah that's the weird. thing about fashion right. it's a weird thing about fashion. because i was i was watching uh i was at the gym. earlier and i was watching uh a uh my buddy. steve hoe uh who was on. shameless right he was at the gym. we didn't go together but i saw him. there and i was like i wonder if we're going to. say hi you ever go to. the gym you see. somebody like i wonder if i'm going. to say hi that guy. like guy i don't know and in my head. i'm like oh maybe people everyone hates. me so so he probably hates me. by now you know i've known him. for 6 years i think the trajectory is he hates. me by now and um so i'm just working out. you know how i do it. i was doing all sorts. of leg stuff and um and he's just the next batman. i mean this guy's he looks great. he looks awesome and he's beefed up. he's yoked and i'm jealous. and it's all good dude. he's also like two inches. taller than me the guy's. a giant he's a good. looking dude whatever anyway. he's doing these workouts. and he's grunting and he's doing it good. and he's all sweaty and i'm looking at him. and i'm like godamn dude. and i go and i say and i'm like chicks. probably love that [ __ ] just he's all sweaty. and his his hair's in his face. i'm like my wife probably thinks he's hot. he's all big and tall. and it doesn't even. matter what he's [ __ ] wearing you know like chicks are always like at the gym. and they're like oh my god i'm a mess. oh i can't even believe i got hit. on at the gym. because i'm in a mess and i had a hat. on and i just women. think that if they wear a hat. that their tits go away. you know what i mean. oh you think that's because you didn't put on makeup. that you plush lips. went away oh my god and i look so ugly in the meantime dude you know and so um i'm looking at him. and i'm like man that's it's kind of unfair. that dudes just don't have to. do uh [ __ ] which goes back to. what i'm talking about putting on my own. uh my new shirt i'm like nobody i feel better. looking but nobody thinks that. it's all in your head. so the key is to. always think to. get to that level of dude. i am looking fantastic. but you can't though can you cu. when you wake up your face. is puffy cuz when you wake up. your hair is absolutely terrible. and when you wake up. and you look in the mirror. you're looking a little flabby hey. you can't get away. from it dude just don't look at yourself. honestly but then you start looking really [ __ ] stupid right. because cuz you're like anyway i worked out harder. after i

[ __ ] [music] competition wait hold on a second bro. this is german this seems like it. would be the most american [ __ ] of all time. and these germans just that's the craziest. [ __ ] you don't even know they got forklifts. in germany and they're [ __ ] hauling tires. this guy has them so precariously balanced how do the [ __ ] they even get him up there dude. how do they get him. up there the slowest competition. of all time dude soft. is good is cool dude. bro hey it's sold out. here it's packed this is like a burke crusher. show what the [ __ ] you think this guy

thing. but it's so slow. wow at least this guy looks exactly. like someone who would operate forklift the thing. i like about german. is every now and then there's a word. to english [music] p. every now and then there's a word. in english dude i was watching a show. in when i was in uh europe. once and they and it was a german. it was the german german. channel it's crazy that like in in europe. they'll they'll they'll have like a bunch of channels. but then one that's just dedicated to. like german german the language. and it's like we're in london. and i would watch it. because it's funny to. me and they would just be like uh every now and then it was a there. was there were english words. in german language and the [ __ ] i was watching this. dude that was obviously a bodyguard. or something being interviewed and he goes i. swear to god he goes. bro i mean i will never forget. this he goes technique. and i was like dude. there's definitely words for killing. and technique in germany. dude i i i swear to. god why and germans get with it. so anyway but they are obviously with it. because they did the they did the um forklift that was sent. over by rob hay uh in our on our patreon. um one shop s shirts. and hoodies for you. at sunkissed coconut dot com. go to my page if you want. purchase 10word ad holler. christalia um oh man. i don't think anything's funnier. i don't think there's anything funnier. than like i was thinking about um these two things a guy. wait that's not the is this. the thing oh wow you put something. here that's not that you said. the worst laugh of all. time and that's the that's also the forklift. competition um i don't think that. so these are the two funniest things. to me either a guy. trying to control his. emotions uh which is why i love the chuck. croissant videos the chuck croissant video. and the guy and and the other on the other podcast. that i do with my brother. lifeline the guy who had the toothbrush the girl. with the toothbrush in his sink it seemed like he was so mad. and seething and trying. not to do it. but or that is the funniest thing. to me a guy trying. to hold in his emotion. but you can see the cracks. to me dude. i there's only one other thing. that well i would say two other. things that are uh at that level. okay a guy falling. down if it's funny. enough or a guy pretending he's not insecure. and you can see's insecure. but you could argue that that's a guy. trying to control his. emotions so no no no here we go. here we go no and no it's today. uh thursday oh god am i still rich. he's on a
