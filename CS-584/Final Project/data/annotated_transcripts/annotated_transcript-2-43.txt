irvine brea oxnard to. nail down exactly what i wanted. to do in my hour. special taping um flew figured that. out flew to. um milwaukee every time. i hear milwaukee i think. milwaukee and i thought that was me. but then i realized that that's the actual indian. way to pronounce it uh. so i must have heard it. somewhere or i'm i'm the psychic indian. um so yeah so milwaukee. and then did the last show. oh it's from wayne's world. milwaukee that's why wayne's world dude. wow uh one fire coming through. dude with that with that wayne's world. thing that's why i got dude. how can you think how could you hear. something when you're 12. and then just think it when you're 43. and then you're like why did i think that and then it's just mike. myers with a wig on 40. years ago um you know. you heard it twice. because you saw it once. and then you saw it. again for your friend's birthday. party and you had to. sit through it twice. um that in ghostbusters too. vigo scared the [ __ ] out of me. um so anyway but yeah so uh so anyway uh uh i did the milwaukee. show and then i flew to. minneapolis to. do the taping now i was actually. a bit nervous i wasn't nervous. like scared i was more anxious. but also a little bit nervous. actually you know what i was. scared for a reason because i there was a storm people kept saying like there's a storm there was no storm but they kept saying there was a storm so i was like oh am i gonna make it the flight got delayed and my one of my buddies. was gonna come out the day. before their whole flight got canceled. there was no flight that they could make it. and they were in la so i was like oh no. if they're in la and we're coming from milwaukee. that's the same direction i. believe i don't know really i'm not good. with directions but i was like zara's gonna get canceled. ours got delayed and we're like should we drive from milwaukee. to minnesota we did. not do that we waited. for the flight got on a flight. landed and then i couldn't even take a nap i was like if i had four hours of sleep um did the special and i was so um ready i mean i'm ready you know and i also i've only been performing this hour for eight months like i did it it was a year so i worked i work at the clubs a little bit to. try and get new material like it was 2021. i started doing it in like september. i would go up every now and then with minimal material. then april came along and i booked a date in phoenix one of my favorite spots. to do um and it was april. 30th and then so a year later. i did um what do you call. it i did uh that i started. the i did the taping. so besides that um it was i took from april to. like august off so it. was really from august to. now i i i was doing the tour. and that's a very short. time actually from when i uh start performing. to to shooting a special. it's usually like a year or or more. you know man on fire. i was touring it for so long. i was so sick of it. but i didn't want to. i didn't want to. do it too here's the deal. when i do the tour. i don't know when this. is going to come. out but when the special comes out. it um it comes. out and uh i'll i will have to. have some new material so. in essence when i when i shoot. to special i have to. then think about starting new material. because by the time it comes. out i want to. have new material and i don't want people. to who have seen this. special to see everything. from the special some comics. do that and they are lazy. but i don't want to. do that i don't feel good. about myself doing that. i also am bored. with the material after i do it. but this hour is so special to. me um it it it. just is um it's not just funny. you know i'm speaking. a lot of stuff from the heart. um and so i was a little nervous about. shooting that because i wanted it. i wanted to really connect. with that emotionally and it's also um not something. that i usually do like when i first did. my specials i just was like i just want. to be funny i don't care. you know people always like you know yeah. but what are you really talking about. it's like i'm talking about how messed up. and silly everything is but this is this special is way. different from my my uh you know. it's me growing and it's me. uh getting out there. and and and now i'm i'm now i'm in my 40s. my last special i did. it when i was 39. and um yeah so i don't know. it's just it went off the first. special the first taping we did. it twice the first taping. was great the second one. was just one of the best. times i did that hour. so it really uh it really means a lot. that you guys came out in minneapolis. i i love you. guys i love the support. that i get uh that everybody. came out on the tour. so far i'm still doing the don't push me tour. because it hasn't come out. yet the special but like um i just so appreciate you and this is what i wanted. to start out with this. podcast but i so appreciate you coming. through and so appreciate you. supporting me um and i just i can't thank you. enough for for for that i really can't. um watching this the the the vlogs and the tour. reports which i put out there. and just uh being a part. of it really genuinely means the world to. me and i know i talk a lot. about you know silly. stuff on this podcast. but uh that's that's what's up. and uh i really i am so fortunate and thankful. that you guys come out to. see me and i love you. for it and i try to. always give you guys the best. show that i possibly can. uh which is also why. i have to i have to. start writing new material. now again but yeah i love it. anyway dude uh let's be silly. you know i know i know i know you like also when i'm when i'm transparent. and all that stuff but let's be silly. too um i don't have a title. yet i i'm circling on what the titles. are will might maybe be uh but i don't know. and when i drop it. i drop the trailer it's gonna go. gangbusters we go. your boys gonna go dummy viral. so we'll drop the title. then you know what i mean. okay anyway stop the cap um i don't know. what the [ __ ] one one fire. added a bunch of things. dude i went to. go i went to. go uh i went to. go put on you know matt. my buddy matt rife hit. me up and he was like yo we post about my special and i was like [ __ ] yeah let's do this the dude's awesome and i and i posted on the thing and i went to. go click the link on that. story to connect it and i copied his i copied his youtube. link to put on my story and i posted. it and then when i posted it after i posted. it the link was a different. link and i was like what. the [ __ ] it is because my producer was on my computer he had already copied the link. since i copied the link. from that rife and put it on the thing. and it was a video. where the guy goes stop the cat. and so that was the link. that was everybody was see and when i did. the matt right thing so anyway go. watch his special it's great he's awesome. he's uh exploded on the. comedy scene but uh it's great. it's out there now it's called. matthew stephen rife it's the whitest name i've ever heard in my life. but also he is uh exploded. so go check his [ __ ] out he's great. um anyway dude you know let's get into. it dude let's get into. it he added a bunch of different. uh things on my on. my sound sound board but that's that's cool. dude how about this man. um kanye loves the jews again. who knew ah and thank god. for 21 jump street because that's what he saw you do it. he watched so he's mental. he's manso man and it's just like okay. he loves it he first of all. he didn't hate the jews. he thought he hated the jews. right that's what he thought he thought that. he's mentally unstable and you. want to be like well [ __ ] it you know it's sad. is mentally unstable but then then you go. like this well you know what hitler. was unstable and mentally unstable so. then there we go everyone in the third. reich was unstable and mentally. imbalanced so okay so then it's like at what. point does it it does it. you know you want to. you want to. give grace to people. who are mentally unwell. but then also you don't want to. give too much grace. because they end up you. know being hitler also so it's like you know. kanye kept doubling it out and doubling down kept doubling down. until they killed me and uh but they kept doubling down. and then all of a sudden adidas was like no. or if you're a dork. you could say adidas um you go all right. well kanye you know it's too. it's too bad i really liked your sneakers. but you can't thank you for working. for us but then you gotta go. so then it's like adidas was like oh wait a minute. we lost 1.6 billion dollars. we fired kanye and it's like. maybe we should rehire kanye. you know what i'm saying and yes what he said. was bad but also we want that. 1.6 billion dollars back again so what happened. was they are talking about rehiring. him and because of that he watched. 21 jump street and said because jonah hill. is in it and did a good job. and he's funny that he doesn't hate jews. anymore and i'm just sitting there. like huh more disrespectful. do you know what i mean. and i'm just sitting there like okay. well it was disrespectful that he hated that. he was saying he hated the juice. but now he lie. the reason why he's come around. on it is because jonah hill's. performance in 21 jump street. huh that's even more disrespectful. to see jonah hill. running around and pretending like he's a cop. in high school and then kanye. west goes like this you know what on second thought june should be more. mad at that that's what turned him. around and he's got the post. up he's got it on instagram. and it's the only post up on it on his instagram feed. and it's just like that's more disrespectful. um so anyway now adidas is just like yeah. we don't give a [ __ ] however. he wants to. say he likes it. again that's okay let's get the 1.9 there's only 1.6 billion dollars. in so anyway kanye loves. the jews again so now. we can chill. dude this could be the point. where the world gets back. on track since the pandemic. everything's gonna [ __ ] this can be the point where it goes back. on track let's just make it with the point. go back on track you know we had trump everyone hated trump. you know the it seemed like everyone. hated trump didn't really. because look you gotta like it then we have biden. everyone hated biden seems like. everyone hate about it. but you know a lot. of people love biden so it's like let's get into. president that's going to get in here. and do some [ __ ] damage right it's all gone to. [ __ ] and kanye west loves. the jews now so let's just get it. let's just everything's better right. guys um what did he actually. write on the thing kanye. west kanye west jonah hill uh. he writes oh god they say seth. rogen reacts to kanye. west saving jonah hill's saying jonah. hill seth rogen you know. you know what did he say. here yay on gay on. instagram this is what he says if you haven't. heard which is crazy if you haven't. heard watching jonah hill. in 21 jump street made me like jewish. people again it's straight to. the point uh no one should take anger. against one or two individuals. and transform that into. hatred toward millions of innocent. people no christian can be labeled. antisemite uh knowing jesus. is jew thank you. jonah hill i love you. you know and then he just and then he and then somebody just writes under that w. though the internet you know. dude that's a that's a w. comment i want people right. yo that's an l. comment that's a l yo. dude that's l so congratulations. to the kanye west and honestly. congratulations to the jews because he's got he's got that back on he's got that. back on is trump arraigned has been arraigned no. he's not been arraigned right. but he will be tomorrow so this. will be coming out the next. day so let's just pretend dude. how about that trump. [ __ ] dude it's crazy he's gonna be arraigned he's never gonna go to. jail so everyone just if he goes to. jail by the way do you understand. how many [ __ ] up things are going to. happen so let's just hope maybe he'll just like he's older. right he's like he'll pass. away i don't know and i'm not even saying i don't don't come at me like i'm a trumper or an antitrumper. i'm neither i don't give a [ __ ] you know. what i do silent. you know how people say silence. is violent that's me. then i guess i'm a violent. guy then says when the [ __ ] is silence. violence i don't like that you know. i don't like that [ __ ] um so anyway dude it's just it's just like oh i forgot the [ __ ] thing though about the on the um man i tell you what dude when you travel a lot it is you really get a representation. of what the [ __ ] america is like i mean i went to. milwaukee and when i got on the plane. to milwaukee i i mean. dude everything is so insane. everything is so insane. i got to the airport. we got on the plane. i got on the plane. and i'm bored on the plane. because the plane because it sucks. right and there was no tv. i think in it. it was like i wanna. every time they get a plane. that was from 1978. so i got a dm the top. dm i go check it. i look it says hey don't worry bro. your bag is safe. and i look at the image and it's a picture. of my bag on the [ __ ] in the plane. like the the guy who puts. the bags in the thing. took a pic of my thing. and then sent it to. me like some [ __ ] and i'm just like a dude that's one of those things that's like it's like that's creepy tell me more about that but it's like you get scared but like for what reason. it's just a picture of a bag. but also you know not to. be creepy on an airplane. dude the guy sends me a picture. of my own bag that's creepy. tell me more about that. it's insane and so i'm like jesus. and i screenshot i said that to. my whole team who's you know. in the plane they go. yo you should report this. guy's like i don't want to. get anybody fired he's like you want me. to report it i'm like no. no chill dude because my uh my tour. manager's gangster dude he's like let me report it. i'll report it i'm like no. dude just chill and i'm like well this guy's just [ __ ] right. here's the [ __ ] up thing everybody has your phone number basically like you can contact anyone anyway from the phone you can talk you want you want to. talk to elon musk. you basically have his phone. number dm i mean guess. what he'll get it. that's so [ __ ] up how connected we are that now i got the the the the the united airlines [ __ ] guy who checks in the he's not even dude. he's not even the guy the person. who checks the bag and he was like the the troglodyte. under the thing near the conveyor belt that. was like with it you know. what i mean with this.

[ __ ] hey move but i was like gangster in the no shame man i aspire to. have that no shame um which is cool. you know it's like here's the other thing. too if i wasn't famous. i would be diarying everywhere. and telling everybody about it. but i'm famous so like i don't even. care people really know i'm diarrhearing places. but it's annoying if like someone gets a picture and it's like yo chrisley is diarrhea. in there it smells like [ __ ] and then i gotta and i gotta deal with everybody. online like yo chrisley a diarrhea. i don't even really give a [ __ ] about that. but also it's annoying that then people will be like everybody. diarrheas you know whatever. it my whole point is that lady. more people should be like that lady. but also dude and then david sullivan. had to do it. and he was like man. man i was when we went to. we flew in somewhere else. and he was like man. oh back to la it. was like i was almost gonna do that. lady did man i had to. go because i ate steak. last night and then drank a coffee. this morning um yeah so that was just amazing. i love it but you really get a taste. when you're when you're when you're traveling. how it literally insane. everyone is but before the flight. was even over this uh young woman. was sitting in front of me. and she was like she goes to. the bat this whole thing is everything. around the bathroom but she's goes to. the bathroom and before. she goes to the bathroom. well no she goes to. the bathroom she gets up. walks out before she gets into. the bathroom uh we're first we're like row. three so the bathroom. is very close before. she even gets it about. them her alarm goes. off bro i was this was the mo. for some reason this really earthy her alarm. goes off and very loud. at the la i didn't even know the alarms. go that i thought here's the deal. i didn't know alarms go. that loud on the iphone. because i don't put mine at the full. blast obviously nothing's happening if you need your alarm. to go off when you're waking up. nothing's making a sound anyway. so don't make it the loudest. [ __ ] if you're somebody who puts the alarm full blast you're kind of a piece of [ __ ] if you live with someone okay and you know i live with someone right so uh i am doing i am i am on the plane this lady gets up and before she gets to. the bathroom her alarm goes. off just pam pam. pam pam pam pam. you know that one pam pam. pam pam just so horrible. okay and i'm like oh good before. she got to. the bathroom so she'll hear it. come back turn it. off planned pap so i'm she that's what she does gets in the [ __ ] [ __ ] so i'm like oh are you she doesn't hear it because it's so loud all right does a whole [ __ ] in the bathroom or piss i don't know maybe sometimes ladies take a long time to. piss because you got to. sit down just the whole time. pam pam pam pam. just i mean three minutes. of this is happening. and i'm sitting there like look i could reach in front of me. turn the thing off but guess what i don't. do i don't touch other people's [ __ ] i'm not gonna touch someone's phone. i don't care if the flight. attendant wants to. come by and touch someone's phone. and turn it off. fun and also if it bothered me. that much i would touch the phone. but it didn't really bother. me that much and i know it's gonna end. as soon as the letter. comes out so i'm chilling. dude i make all these decisions. pretty quickly uh it takes. three minutes anyway the whole. thing happens for three minutes. this is that doesn't bother. me that much okay. what happened with that lady. doesn't bother me that much. doesn't really bother. me that the sound is happening. flying is annoying anyway. this is the worst part. dude the lady next to. me who the whole flight. has been this every like every 30. seconds and dude it's one of those things. that you don't realize happening. and then once you do once. you do okay catch you later. man i mean i was getting so livid so the lady. who's sniffing next to. me i was like pam pam. pam pam pam like she the sniffer. turns to me okay. i'm on my phone texting. people she turns to. me and says is that your phone.

[ __ ] dude so many [ __ ] things are wrong with this. first of all why would i wait. that long okay but even further before. that why would she wait. that long to. ask me so she's at fault. for more than i it's not my phone. okay but also if she's waiting that long to. ask me is that your phone. that she's at fault. here if she thinks maybe it's my phone. she should have said something. already three minutes is that my phone. dude also snot my phone. you know why i'm not deaf also. i'm on my phone looking. at my phone i'm also looking around. like oh wow i'm looking at people. she says is
