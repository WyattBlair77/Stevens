 hey guys welcome to. another episode of congratulations. crazy crazy crazy [music] it's another episode. it's another episode of congratulations. and um [music] you. know we got it up. we got it all dude. we got it all in life. don't we we got it. all you just got to. realize it that's why i say life. rips man a lot. of people write in to. me about uh the hard. times that they're going through. and life is as good as you make it. and you can just basically have no. limbs and still have life. be ripping it's all about a mentality. baby and that's why uh you know. oh by the way that's why we got these here life. rips these are new the new. colorway on the [ __ ] um podcast go to. chrisley dot com and you know. it's like yeah life rips but also i gotta collect. racks so it's like that's that's what it. is um so yeah it's like oh his message. is also collecting racks but it's like any message. collects racks right so it's a movement. yada yada people get tattoos it's a yada yada. it's a cult yada. yada and it's all good but uh you know that's how we do it. gotta come clean my babies. gotta come clean dude. and i'll tell you why dude. and i'll tell you why and you don't even. know you don't even understand. uh what i'm about to. say but last time. i had a uh podcast episode of congratulations. i uh we had a conversation. me and won fire. and kristen afterwards and we were talking. about how carhartt was. the new von dutch about. how von dutch was firing. on all syllables for. a while killing it. [ __ ] absolutely changing the game and then all of a sudden paris hilton wore the [ __ ] and then it [ __ ] petered out now it's not parasite's fault. is van dutch's fault. but then carhartt became that [ __ ] right carhartt. was pretty cool all the kid. hit kids were wearing it. and all the [ __ ] um guys were wearing those orange beanies. with the car hard. shits or if you're a king in the sting fan you absolutely wear car. heart right because there's no such thing. as a king in the sting. fan that doesn't have at least two three articles. of car clothing okay. and they've got that real industrial ship. but this not because they're hipsters. it's because they do real. industrial [ __ ] and they're in pittsburgh. right um but i was like man. i can't believe how i got out. of the [ __ ] carhartt thing. without even doing it. because i thought i felt the carhartt. pull i felt the pull and now. it's getting a little bit overboard. with the hipsters in los. angeles with the twisty. mustaches wearing a [ __ ] carhartt industrial cargo pants. right or a nice flannel. that's bulky and [ __ ] like they even wear gloves. in the wintertime and i was like i got out. of it without wearing it. and then i looked in my closet. today and boy oh boy. dude did i forget. about ordering a car. hard thing a few months. ago and i'm wearing it. right now and i never [ __ ] wore it because i have to. expose myself because i gotta come clean. my babies [music] i'm i'm you know am i hipster am i industrial you do the math. dude i'm a little bit im. you right i'm that industrial hipster that's what i am. and uh and i feel a little bit phony but dude. i completely forgot about having the car. hard shard i really forgot about it. so anyway that's it dude. i had to come clean. um we got to. tell the truth here we got to. [ __ ] talk about the real hardhitting issues. and you don't know me. if you don't know me. right and i have to. let you know me. i started this whole podcast. because i still wanted to. [ __ ] uh uh i was a little bit trepidatious and starting the podcast if you if you listen to. the first or second episode. ever i talk about how you know. i don't really want you. to know who i am i don't. really want because i still want. to do roles as an as an artist. as an actor and [ __ ] i mean how the [ __ ] can i daniel day. lewis head up right if you guys know all about my [ __ ] like i'm i'm exposing myself about carhartt. but [ __ ] you don't know what daniel daylewis. is really like you don't know. what leonardo dicaprio really. is like besides the fact that he like you know. wants to save the ocean. or whatever but you don't. know if i want to. [ __ ] i didn't want you to. know if i i didn't want you to. know if i wanted to save. the ocean or not when i started this. podcast and now you're now you know every all the [ __ ] ins. and outs about me dude. i mean i've cried. on this podcast multiple franken times. sad all good though. we persevere we get through. it right because life rips you collect. bags or you don't you. have limbs or you don't. you get cans or you. don't but life rips i mean. everybody gets cancer right just depends on when you get it. hopefully you're getting it. at like 80 something. or even 90. but my point. is now you know me. oopsie daisy whoopsy daisy was it by design no but it was my destiny wasn't it it was right do you believe in destiny or not is it. a bunch of malarkey. i don't know when somebody comes up. to me and they say do. you believe in fate i go. like this dude i don't really talk. or think about that man. you got the wrong guy. don't you guess how many times in my life. i've thought about fate honestly. give it a good hard. long thought fate destiny guess how many times in my life. well if you're an avid. listener you probably get zero and you'd be right because that's the whole thing is it by design life or is choice something and my whole [ __ ] is who [ __ ] cares we're never gonna know oh yeah but those are the earth's unanswered questions don't you want to. know why we're here what's the meaning. of life when somebody says what's the meaning. of life i think but what do you mean. the meaning of life is whatever. you want it to. be isn't it a lot. of parents will say the meaning of life. is about being a parent. i love my son. i love my daughter but bro. the meaning of life could be about i mean. as ben and jerry it might be ice. cream dude and if that's the meaning of life. for them then that's the meaning of [ __ ] life so stop asking me what the meaning of life. is if we're just having a conversation because it's whatever you [ __ ] make it dude. is fate real i don't know. is destiny real i don't know. is choice real maybe feels like i'm choosing. doesn't it when i look at two. pair of shoes and i wear one i chose. that one didn't i so i don't get heady. and uh i don't get you know. i don't get too right. i don't get to. you know what i'm talking. about in my [ __ ] in my in my in my head right. but sometimes we start the podcast. and we're talking about real. hard hitting issues you know some things in life. make you sit back and they make you think about it. like i did the road. technically it was an arrow. away oxnard i did improv. levity live and uh it was the first time i actually did quote unquote. the road it's a little bit. funny to call oxnard the road. when you live in la but it is. they get comics from all. over the place uh los angeles. you know but also new york. and boston and chicago or where the [ __ ] lives wherever i don't know. tennessee um and i i i accepted. a weekend you know they reached out and i said yeah. um but you know if you know if you want to. go on the more chris uh more crystallia. channel you can see the the vlog. there that we did we had a lot. of and friends which were uh king batch. trevor wallace uh brendan shaw brian callan and um michael lanochi and uh maddie chimber which is a new comedian. that's very funny you should check him. out but we did that in oxnard california and it was awesome. um we had a really great. time but i'll tell you man. driving down there we got this van. and everybody piled in we made a [ __ ] thing of it. it was like 11 people. in the van kristen. was there too kristen. even brought her mom one. of the shows um and uh it was uh you know i got in the van. got to the oc. got to the place. oxnard went into the green. room and boy was it a mixed. bag of emotions man. i don't like when people say stuff. like that but it really was it. was like a bag that. i put all my emotions in and i could look inside. of it and think huh. look at all those emotions but instead of looking it. was feeling right i just wanted to. cinch it up but i couldn't man. it was like it was overflowing. like i i was a little bit excited. but also thinking i wonder what it'll be like right. like two years ago. when i would [ __ ] just dang it on the road. just binky right i just do [ __ ] madison and then milwaukee and chicago. and right uh this was a oneoff. i was gonna be there do five shows. and that's it and um i was uh going. to the show and it was exciting. i got to the green. room and immediately i felt this. overwhelming sadness and i don't know what it. was i don't know what it. was but i was excited i saw the green. room and then it was like wow. it was like you were transported. back now i know the last time. i did the road was about. two years ago but it was like i was transported back. to legitimately my my mother. would like hold me. and tell me it's okay. or some [ __ ] it was back when like i was transported back. to another time it was like a past. life i mean look i'm still a comedian. i do shows at the laugh. factory that improv all the time. but this was the road. technically and i was in the green. room and the whole crowd. was just waiting for me. to go on but i'm a different. i'm a different man. now like my son is a huge part. of my life i don't live. with the doors closed. anymore i live with them. open and that's what this. whole mixed bags of emotion. was because i was feeling everything. and it was [ __ ] insane. man it was vivid. i was happy and sad. and all of it right. and kristen showed up. with her mom supporting me. and uh you know my my real homies. were there and it was a lot. i don't even really know. how to describe it. i'm trying here each friend. would go up and go on stage. and it felt good it. felt good the applause. they got everyone was having a great. time in the audience the comedians all killed. and then i went on and the first show. i went on was a friday. early show and i went on and it was amazing. and as soon as i got out. there i've they started cheering. you know loudly for a long. time some bragging i don't mean. to brag but this is what happened. and i felt behind my face. just swell up and i'm like for [ __ ] sake you know you get that little taste of copper in the back. of your [ __ ] mouth and you're like am i gonna [ __ ] is this gonna am i gonna start my eyes gonna cascade what the [ __ ] am i gonna turn into. a japanimation character what the [ __ ] is going. on i let it subside with the crowd. and i did my act and about you know. i did 35 40 minutes about 25. 20 minutes into. my act i started talking. about my son and i [ __ ] couldn't help but god damn it. i started crying man. and it just came out. and i said god. damn it i get to. this part and i start. crying and everyone was cool. with it and it felt nice. to be vulnerable to. a bunch of people and it felt natural. too which is the weirdest. part because all of the stuff. that i've been thinking about and doing in the past. year and a half. or whatever with my family. and myself and just other people like the walls down. [ __ ] feels like it's working. because when i'm on stage and i can be vulnerable like that. i mean it is a far. cry from the guy. who started this podcast. that didn't want to. have anyone know who he was but it's because if i'm honest. i don't think i wanted. to know who i was i don't. think you know i talked about this. a little bit in my act. but this business they just [ __ ] reward. you for things when you're hot. and it's easy to. just lose to. that as a weak person. or as a person with moments. of weakness you know so it's interesting. this journey is another word. i don't like because it's like seems pretentious but it's what it. is right and everyone's got their own. [ __ ] and for the people that came out to. my show um thank you. for coming i normally start. this podcast off ripping and roaring. but i don't know i didn't want. to or i thought i wanted to. but it didn't happen. just like when i thought i wanted to. start the podcast and keep you at arm's. length that didn't happen either i i was with uh the other night i started doing my group. therapy i was on zoom. and i i said goodnight to. calvin and he was really. [ __ ] tired and i could tell by the time i got out. of my group therapy he was. gonna be asleep i got out. at nine and i knew he was gonna be asleep. and i got out and i walked upstairs and i noticed on. the on the that calvin's. door is open i'm like what the [ __ ] is going on and i go into. my bedroom and he's there with kristin. and he's saying and he's in his sleep. sack and chris said he was just up. he was staying up for an hour. and he wasn't even uh he wasn't even. um going to. sleep he was just sitting. up in his crib. uh and so and so he was sucking his thumb. holding the back of his head. which he always does and tarzan is blaring. i mean phil collins is just like even when he's [ __ ] swinging through vines whatever the [ __ ] he's singing you know um he's got the line cloth carefully placed over. him when he's swinging. through the vines why don't we show. his [ __ ] his [ __ ] would be flailing around from trunk to. trunk we would be showing. his trunk but we're not [music]. because this is disney or whatever. the [ __ ] you're telling me. that when he never climbs he doesn't scrape the [ __ ] out. of his [ __ ] come on that loincloth isn't even tired understand. it's just carefully tied around. his waist i mean come on you can't. even [ __ ] have a rope. tied unless it's doubly tied without it. opening up and exposing your card. tarzan should have so in conclusion tizen should have a scrapey. dick right but it's covered. right because it's disney. right [laughter] the biggest [ __ ] in the disney family. is doesn't have a screen. pdf [laughter] so anyway dude. um so anyway where he's there. and [ __ ] tarzan's just swinging around with his loin. cloth around how do you even get it there's just bananas and coconuts and apes how do you even get it does he sew with what hey tarzan nice to. meet you where's your scrapey. dick right so um even the monkeys. are like where's the scrapey. dick right so he meets [ __ ] so he's doing it and i and i say what the f i say what the [ __ ] kristen and she says he was up he wouldn't go to. bed so i brought him. in here we're watching tarzan and he looks and calvin. goes looks at me looks back. to tarzan all eyes. on tarzan dude my son loves. him from tarzan and secretly i was hoping he was going. to point to tarzan and say dad died. because you know tarzan's buff. and he's got long hair. and i was like maybe my son sees me like that he didn't do. it for a while but he ended up doing it. he ended up pointing to. it and saying dada so that made me feel good. and that's the kind of [ __ ] [ __ ] i am a 41. year old that has a [ __ ] twoyearold son that gets happy when he points to. tarzan and says da da because then i secretly think well maybe my son. thinks i'm buff got probs so anyway um. we're watching the thing and calvin's. got a bowl of [ __ ] pretzels do it and he's just housing a man. i mean he's just like a [ __ ] tree trimmer. just just housing him he's got two. three in his hands and his little [ __ ] hands and i was like what are you watching and he and he points. and he ate all the [ __ ] pretzels in the bowl dude right and kristen had chinese food. like a [ __ ] piggy that she ordered while i was doing my [ __ ] group therapy and it was just the whole. room stunk like [ __ ] right because of the chinese. food when someone brings chinese. food in and you're not hungry. game over dude if you're in a [ __ ] house and somebody and you just ate and somebody brings chinese food over uninvite. that [ __ ] oh it stinks to. high hell huh you know. how rude it is to. bro that's like one time. i was on a plane. and somebody brought popeyes on. the plane and just started eating this. [ __ ] and it was like cool i'd rather go down. and it was a lady. so you can't say anything. you know if it's a dude. maybe you just give them. a look or you'll be like ah bro. really you're gonna eat a [ __ ] six piece on on the way. to tucson so um so he's watching the thing. and he's eating the pretzels. finishes the pretzels and kristen does the most [ __ ] uh what like the most like dick [ __ ] the most like this is what she does she says you want more pretzels and he says yes and she says oh really well do you want dada to. go get you more pretzels and now i'm like it's all on my son. my laziness rides on my son. right because if kristen was like hey can you go get pretzels. for me i could reply with. your legs don't work but she's asking me. in front of my blood. she's asking me in front of my son. and if i disobey kristen in front of my son. he grows up and he [ __ ] up life. i'm trying to limit. those i don't want my son. to be a chippendales dancer. right i don't want my son. to hold up banks so now she hits. me well through calvin secretly hits me. with the hey calvin do you want. do you want dad. dad to. go get pretzels oh and my son knows those words. so i'm sitting waiting dude. waiting for my son. to answer and he looks into. my eyes past my face. and says yes well i guess i'm moving ain't. that just like life man. you used my son to. thwart my laziness unfucking believable. dude kristen unbelievable you used. my son to thwart my laziness so i get up. and i say sure and guess what i'm [ __ ] happy. about it that's the most annoying. part because i love my son. yes [music] so i'm going. downstairs i fill it up. with pretzels and i dude this is how good of a dad. i am i don't even. do it with one version of pretzels. we got three versions of pretzels. i had the twisty shits. the stick shits and the pretzel. chips bro i put them all in like like it was [ __ ] cereal. dude i put them all in the bowl. like it was my emotions. in oxnard dude and i brought it. upstairs and i'm mumbling well. i'm not mumbling but i might as well. be because in my head. i'm thinking i'm a [ __ ] jeep yeah. guys i'm one pretzel well i'm a [ __ ] dad and went down and you fought my laziness and we got three [ __ ] different things so i bring them up dude. you know you when you're riding with a certain type of [ __ ] when you're riding when you're snacking when you're out. there and you're snacking maybe you're watching shark. tank but you're out there. snacking and you know you're riding with a certain type of chip. what are you gonna do you're gonna remain. with that chip aren't you right. you got sour cream. and onion and then you got [ __ ] mesquite flavor. and then you got pretzels if you're [ __ ] with sour. cream and onion that bag. is gonna be empty before you. even touch mesquite [ __ ] before you even breathe on the pretzels. and my son was rocking with the twisty. shits well i brought the twisty. shits i brought the sticks up. and the pretzel chips bro. we got it all and i give it to. him and i think i wonder he was gonna do like that. that does and only rock. with the twisty shits. and sure enough he only rocked. with the twisty shits. but then kristen told me. something that was so [ __ ] cute. when i got there he said she said i can't. believe what he just did. i said what and she said. and she said halfway. in the middle of while you were there. he looked at me. with his palms up and he goes. tada like he was [ __ ]. impatient dude hey man you don't. even really know how time. works okay you haven't even lived. two years dude i've waited. for [ __ ] longer than you've been alive and this guy's pissed off. with how long i'm taking dude. don't go palms up. to dada oh dude you go palms up. you're not a bad kid. you're a good boy just maybe figure out. how time works before. you go palms up with dada. that's all bro it was hilarious. dada and then he goes. and takes two and [ __ ] didn't eat the chips or this. or the sticks just the just the twisty. shits so he rides like dada with the chips uh and it was cute. then we watched [ __ ] uh tarzan and for a little bit and i oh dude. and then i was getting so tired. and she put calvin to. bed in the in his in his crib. and then i was so tired. dude and i started falling. asleep and god damn it. dude why why i get i wonder if you does. this happen to.

i was too [ __ ] about to. talk to we had surrounded i could. have struck up a conversation. i could have said hey lady. you're a fan of ceramic. balls and straw witches. too and the love could have. blossomed and we could have had a child. that re that we raised. in this beautiful well decked out. ceramic balled up straw. witch to one bedroom apartment and we're gonna raid. raise this child and this child could have grown up and we could have taught him [ __ ] and there could have been so much love in our family and then one day this kid could grow up to. go to a different own. goods and get [ __ ] his own ceramic balls with straw witches and met another person what could have done that but i missed. the moment i didn't connect. with the lady with the ceramic balls. in the straw witch so
