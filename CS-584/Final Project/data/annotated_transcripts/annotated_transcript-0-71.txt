well other people are meeting up. and i'm like oh no i got to. sit here wait on a lime. scooter for my wife. to get a moood to. with other people that are are i'm i'm going. to have to. meet you know and so we're like waiting and i'm looking around. like where are the dorks. but then i'm like i wouldn't know my wife. was waiting for a mww. so i'm like there could be anybody. and i'm looking around. and then i see this table of three. dudes that look look and i'm just going. to level with you okay they look like they're on the spectrum. and that's it and i i don't you know. what i mean like i don't know. if that sounds bad or what. or if you're going to. turn this off but that's how they looked you. know if i was writing a novel. that's how i would write. and alas they looked like they were far. over to one side. of the spectrum or at least. a little bit and you would get it. how about that you would get it. so it's your fault. too um and they're sitting around. a table and i swear. one of them just says ah you must be panda. to my wife and my wife says no. no i'm actually kt pokey pokey. head or whatever the heck. it is like okay well i guess. we're still waiting for panda i don't know. where panda is but we got to. get started pretty soon i have to. defeat the m and catch him. catch the m so we sit there and she gets uh to. attack in the meww and with the pokeballs with the three. other dudes panda panda ended up showing up. with her boyfriend and it was uh there were two people. and they were both attacking. so there were two three five six six people. that defeated m that day. and i was sitting waiting on my lime. scooter probably the orest of them. all cuz i was on a lime. scooter waiting hey chris. what are you doing waiting. for my girlfriend actually waiting for my girlfriend. to capture a mww so. we can move so. we can move on. and look at the battleship. it's a it's a it's a military it's a military. town so she got the mwo and then we went to. go look at the um battleship. which i don't know man. it's just like you know i guess. the the play should make money. off of the battleship because they parked it. and now it should be a tourist site. so so there it is you know people just walk in and out. of the battleships and stuff. they got [ __ ] battleships outside. it's a little disconcerting you know. i mean i know i'm not like mr. americ american but it's weird. when you look out of the the hotel. room and you just see [ __ ] three battleships. like i know i know i know it's history but also though. it's crazy in in uh it it. you know it's crazy. because well speaking of history they found an uh a pyramid in antarctica. not in egypt antarctica which means. we're dead which means we're dead. i the more i hear stuff. the more i think that history just kind of i feel like we blew. up the world and then started over. again i feel like we were really technologically savvy right. around you know the year. zero blew up and then you know uh geologists at the german. research center for geosciences in poim said the pyramid shaped. structures are located in. the ellsworth mountains which is uh a range. more than 400 km long. so it's no surprise our rocky. pet's popping out the eyes. i don't know um they're beneath. the ice um and they're trying to. pretend like it's just something. that happened i guess that a mountain. poking out of the top. of the ice and not a mysterious. pyram look at the way they're saying. in this article so the new location. is just that a mountain. poking out of the top. of the ice antarctica and not a mysterious. pyramid at all trying to. cover it up antarctica has been been the subject. of more than its fair share. of speculation recently uh after conspiracy. theorist eric hecker described. the amson scott south pole. station by the south pole. as air traffic control hub. for aliens earlier this year. trying to cover it. up hecker claimed that 2010. ron that in 2010. ron the us aerospace and defense. conglomerate chose him to. be a contractor to. the uh on the research. center operated by the united states national science. foundation there was much more quote unquote. to the station that met. the eye according to. trying to cover it. up shoot him take them. out dude i don't know why you know here's the thing that i i know governments obviously take people out and stuff but i i i kind of wish they would just take more people out i don't i i want i want them. to get just you know like that. thing to be the last thing. that they hear loose. lips sink ships loose lips sink our country. and you know i am a patriot so. anytime someone speaks out or uncovers some documents. or carries around a dossier. even that's it last thing. you hear and they fall on the ground. why isn't the government there's a po. there's too many people in the world. in the in in our country. hey government come on start. offing some people look. loose lips belong 6 ft. deep that's my new one. um it was easter. and my son's dressed up nice. we were at my aunt's house. it was nice came back and saw so many posts on instagram. that was like remember easter. isn't

out or add holler. bab. christalia the um let's do some of these here. uh misconnections uh it's been a bit. since we've done misconnections. honestly and there's there's a few of them. here just a few but i people still doing. this huh like with all the [ __ ] out there tinder and hinge. and the gay one. there's still on craigslist. just like sup you know. here we go part time. personal assistant parttime lover us guys looking to. get me tooed for sure um i'm looking for a woman. parttime work at my office. personal assistant and parttime a lover woman. only dude god the internet. just ruined everything huh. this guy just is the bare. minimum doing the bare minimum just being so lazy hey guy go out and try to. get hey guy go out. and try to. get laate it's supposed. to be hard you know. if i could just let me. just uh two birds two birds. with one stone here i do need an assistant and i do like coming i do i do need an assistant and i sure love bending women. over ah you know i could get a male assistant. and then a female lover but it's like you know. just can i if i get them. both in the same it's like cheaper. and also probably less of a headache. number one i need my taxes. done number two i need someone to. go to the grocery. store number three i certainly love spurting. so it's the deal dude. here's another one looking for a female who is into. pegging gay or wants to. i don't think it's gay. actually it's that's a good question. i i know i know black people think it's gay. but uh like there's no black person. on the planet that thinks that getting. pegged by a woman isn't sus. you know and i i am. of the camp where i think you're gay. if you want to. sleep with a dude and you're a dude. and that's it really that's it. and then you and you do it. you can also not do it. and still be gay it's about the want. in your head you know. i mean you can completely splur i don't know. if you can splurt in a dude. but you could probably hook. up with one and not be gay. if you if you were like i don't know i was with a guy. once talking it sounds no. diddy but this sounds uh but i was with and he was like someone. said he said something suspect. and then another guy said oh man. are you gay and he was like no. no i no not gay. i know that and we were like huh. and he was like yep. 100% s s i'm not gay. and we were like how the hell why. do you react like that. like why do you know. cuz if you ask me. if i'm gay i'll just be like nah i'm not. gay you know and i was like why. are you gay he said because when i was younger. i tried having sex with a man. and i'm telling you not. for me and it's like that's an interesting. point but also how'd you get to. the point where you were. naked you know how did how did you get to. the point where you were. kissing with a bone doggy. how'd you get to. that point not for you. kind of for you you know. kind of for you ah once. i did it after i split. it and i came out and what myself off and realize you know what like it's not [ __ ] a vgo mortensson movie it's gay sex yeah i don't really like that actor dude you boned them. yay so i think you could probably do. it and not be gay. but for all tense purposes. you're gay if you do it. right like you're not going to. really convince anyone you're not gay. if you do it so perception. is reality you gay. and it's fine but um this. one says looking for a female who's independent. so anyway i don't think it's i don't think it's gay. if a female pegs you. i don't think it's gay. i've never done it. myself uh not cuz i'm not gay. just seems like it hurts. also why would you be doing that. when you can be doing all the other fun. stuff during sex so this. is what it says looking. for female who's into. pegging or wants to. try it out to. take me to. gapplebees disgusting um how could you make it. more disgusting dude gapplebees frat. guy wrote it drunk. late at night frat guy. wrote it drunk right. dud take me to. gapplebees classic man turn my black light. on see if you can take me. to gapplebees here's another guy doing the bare. minimum the subject is st. starbucks white girl and then his body is let me take you to. cancun absolutely doesn't give a [ __ ] if we takes to. cancun is so [ __ ] potbellied and ugly. you know crazy the internet's nuts. dude anonymous sex you know people do that. that's so crazy people do anonymous. sex people do sex where you show. up and and they go oh you see. they go i don't know. they go oh really yeah. i don't i don't know but i i set. it up from the internet. so guess we're [ __ ] and then chicks will who is it i don't know your dad. died early you know what i'm saying. your dad died early. and that's okay and you know. i know people say to. me hey don't ho. shame or whatever but also let's face. it ho shame i know they say don't oh it's [ __ ] shame right but also and i get it dude. anyone could have as many part. as they want but also you l. a lot of guys inside. you you dad died early. and that's all i'm saying and it's sad. but it's sad for you. it's sad for me. too i don't want your dad. to die early but because of that you know you let a lot. of guys enter you and that's all good. it's not my business but if you make it. my business you going to. make fun of it. you know and that's fine. okay it's it's all good. um cuz guys like to. have sex with a lot. of women and you know. women try to shame. them for it too i like i like the women. that are like these guys are so shitty. i'm 35 i made i made something out of myself. and i'm not married. and i'm looking for a man. and i'm so pissed off. i you know i was listening. to this woman say i'm so pissed. off because all guys are going. for like these 20s. something year olds and it's like they're they're perverts for. that and it's like okay. well you know hey dude don't get upset. at the guys just because you chose. your life path you made a decision. you made your bed lay in it. you see what i'm talking about. you don't get to. make us feel guilty you. made your bed laying it you. wanted to be a strong. woman here you roar. roar great for you. don't make me feel guilty you. made your bed play in it. you know what i'm talking. about it's just like yeah. you can do anything you want in this. world but nobody wants to. here's well you can't do anything. you want right can't murder. they'll get you i don't know how there's still serial. killers i can't even understand. how they're still serial. killers it's absolutely in and then i think about like the stuff. cuz you know those things. on the um what do. you call it like there's so many crime. documentaries and all that stuff. and we watch all of them. uh and we watched them. and dude if i was a serial killer in this. in 1978 hey dude hey i think i could kill. 1,500 people and i i still don't think i get caught. people getting caught after eight. people like dude jeffrey dmer. got caught huh. hey uh john wayne. gasey got caught huh. hey dude nobody had cameras nobody had twitter nobody had. nothing i could how do you get caught. in the 80s how would you have gotten caught when i see. movies where the police are like or documentaries. where the police are like zeroing in on a suspect. i'm like dude how i tell you what i think i could. 1,500 is a lot i think i could probably [music]. murder 40 to. 50 people in 1980 and that's that's on. god okay now i think you could get if you spac them. out not all at once right. not like a a mass. killing you could maybe get. three anyone who gets more than three. is the most gangster killer of all. how do you avoid. how do you avoid. the every cameras are everywhere. you ever seen that show uh c. no evil or c. no what is it you. know mary eldrid turned 26. she took her extra babysitting. money to go to. you know and then disappeared and then they just where the c. cameras are everywhere cameras are everywhere. they're on the outside of ves. they're on the outside of shoppr. right they're on the inside. of radio shack they're outside. you're down your street if you get if you leave your house. keep walking in a few. steps you're getting filmed dude. in 1980 i could have killed. 40 to 50 40. to 50 people in gapplebees. it's nuts bro they're clamping. down on everybody. dude you could just go. out there and say all the racial slurs back in the 80s. and just do it fire. them out there and now you can't. and now we're filming stuff. like this guy just just screwdriving into. a car feed first. gu just screw driving. into i mean hey dude how do you practice. this also why is he jumping. from a car oh that's so i'm not going. to lie that's so cool. dude i i i i i i need to. do that you start with convertibles right. make it a little easier. and you just roll down the windows. man the [ __ ] how much would it hurt. if you missed though. your dick would just [ __ ] scrape off. i used to. have a um a fantasy about driving. and having to. go to the bathroom. and then i would just roll. down my window and as i'm driving. just pee but my pee stream would go. enough up to go. out of the window. that i could just keep driving. and peeing out the window. without getting up and moving but you can't. do that obviously and honestly. i'll tell you this much i fill up so many water. bottles when i go in the in the car. i i don't
