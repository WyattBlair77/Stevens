[ __ ] and i mean all of this [ __ ] like nose ring alternative lifestyle your tongue. is split and and the green. hair and it's karen you got to. go to the coffee. shop that's like have a [ __ ] be in the meadowver you want to. be a [ __ ] ethereum so bad. you know what i mean. go get coffee on the [ __ ] blockchain. be fake drinking it right. be fake drinking your [ __ ] macchiato on a blockchain. okay karen 3000 it's like um so she's there. and already everyone is just like oh [ __ ] checking the back. of their necks for that. plugin oh hold up. okay no this is real. coffee bean cool and um i drink. the coffee it feels. real okay are we on the blockchain. ma'am and uh so and and as if that's not enough and this is i didn't mean. to talk about all this. metaversion but this was the thing. that she was doing dude. there's always music playing in a coffee. shop unless it's green blatz which [ __ ] closed down. and was next to. the laugh factory and greenblatt. was this diner that we it was unfair. what this [ __ ] diner did to. us dude it was next. to the laugh after i used to. go all the time and i used to. get that [ __ ] reuben sandwich with turkey pastrami and one time first of all they brought it and they brought turkey and pastrami and i [ __ ] up dude i realized that's my fault. because i didn't say took a pastrami i said can i get turkey. pastrami and that's too slow. to say that okay it's tooth. and that's and that's me that's my fault. so when they brought it guess. what i did i ate some of it. and then didn't eat the rest and i didn't send it. back because i [ __ ] up there's rules and i didn't go by them and the unspoken rules. are the more important rules. because that shows that you get it. if you abide by the unspoken. rules you get it. dude you're in our matrix right. and we got our own. karens right like i get you can't rob and steal. i don't do that but those rules. are written but when you say turkey pastrami and not turkey pastrami and you get back. turkey and pastrami you failed. okay so now when i order. that [ __ ] i run it. together i'm like the micro machines. man dude i'm like turquoise. ramen can i get a turkey. pastrami sandwich and they say oh sure. and if they don't look impressed. with how fast i said it. i say you know i meant. turkey pastrami and not turkey and pastrami right. and they say oh yeah so we win. [ __ ] we win right i got my own nft [ __ ] in our matrix in our metaverse. and i know the unspoken. rules so um what this. greenblatt did was and they got real. nuts with it do it and i didn't even know it. was like there's this video game. i was watching the other day. on youtube and they uploaded this. thing and i was watching this. level i didn't remember what the hell it. was but the level started. and it was like this. i didn't even realize but halfway. through there was this lowgrade music. and then by the time. the guy got to. the boss of the of that. level it was the boss that was playing the the boss that you were fighting. was actually playing this. organ and that was where the lowgrade music. was coming from all along and i was like dude. not only did i not even really understand. that there was a guy. playing an organ throughout this. whole video game i didn't even really understand. there was music playing it. drifted in and now i gotta fight. this guy right i felt had but greenblatt. i would go years and years. and then one day all of a sudden. my buddy um who is an animator and just kind of not in the comedian. life he wasn't hooked into. our world um he just said know. what's weird about greenblatt. while we were eating there. and i said what and he said they don't. play music and i never realized i have never been to. a [ __ ] diner or a deli that just didn't have some sort of [ __ ] do you know [ __ ] jack johnson playing or even like enya or [ __ ] what's her name uh what's your [ __ ] katy perry like they play something right you're eating a sandwich you don't even realize you're eating it to. the beat you know you're like you're you're eating. a [ __ ] burrito and you're like why am i [ __ ] oh i'm eating to. the beat of the [ __ ] lovely. lady lumps or whatever the [ __ ] the song. is from black eyed peas. but had us dude. we were eating and it was like what. is going on and i realized once. once he said they don't play. music every time i went in i was like man. this is so weird. dude can you put on some lovely. lady lumps please i'll have the black eyed peas. and also play the black eyed peas. er worst joke ever. and so um and this is the reason. why i bring it up. this is the reason why i bring up. this whole thing i know. i got sidetracked into. [ __ ] there were many tentacles in this conversation and many tentacles in this story and let's just get back to. the [ __ ] squid right we'll get back to. the squid all right we're all the arms of the squad. i went off i started talking. about an air fryer i went. off i started talking about nfts. i went off i started talking. about the fifth element. and all the other things this. the music at greenblatt. but let's get back to. the squid all right let's get back to. that beak part of the squid. did you even know that. the squid has a beak part. did you know that a squid. has a [ __ ] beak straight up did you know that squids have beaks. man and we're just supposed. to be out here living. our lives right somebody invented the internet. and a [ __ ] toaster and we forgot. all about squid beaks dude. squid there's a beak and they shoot. out they wrap you up. and they shoot out and they beat you. the [ __ ] up in your chest. that's how steve irwin died. i think maybe you know. what i mean they got beaks. dude [ __ ] underwater they got beaks dude. i didn't know that they're wet. birds in there dude just not flying. just beaking it up. man pulling you in french. kissing you [ __ ] making your [ __ ] all [ __ ] up making your [ __ ] all lumpy making your [ __ ] like ground beef with their [ __ ] beak just [ __ ] great you ever see the end of that [ __ ] uh prometheus or whatever the [ __ ] movie is where they were that big ass tall white guy that's secretly black dude when they made that movie prometheus with the [ __ ] guy in it michael fassbender or whatever which is a madeup name fast bender but dude when when when they at the end when the alien comes out because he's been cooking for the whole. time in the lab and he comes. out and he grabs that bigass albino white black dude. dude they tried to. make it so that do you have you seen. that movie you know what i'm talking. about the bigass white. duties in the beginning. and the end of the movie. because in the beginning of the movie and then we go we'll see. how he was [ __ ] made or whatever the prometheus movie it was that from the aliens. thing from the aliens. uh quadruply trilogy how many. alien movies are there. [ __ ] ten of them anyway there's this big ass duty just literally straight up looks like [ __ ] michael jordan it's so racist so they were like we got to. make him completely albino you know. he was an albino in the beginning. but they were like dude. he looks like a black guy. they're going to come. for us the woke mob's. going to come for us. we got to make them. white and they just kept making them. whiter and whiter and whiter until he was [ __ ] translucent. and they were like this. is basically it anyway. when that [ __ ] at the end when the alien comes in and they pull him in the guy the white dude. is extra strong because he's an alien but that. [ __ ] alien comes in with the tentacles. and brings them in all into. his [ __ ] mouth [ __ ] and beaks him. up dude so that's what i'm saying. let's get back to that beak. what were we talking about. though what even was the [ __ ] thing i was saying i was talking about the lady dancing. the reason why i was talking about this. whole thing about the [ __ ] thing that happened at coffee. bean is because all of a sudden this fifth. element nft style girl with the karen. haircut from [ __ ] rainbow brite dude. she starts uh dancing in the cafe. she starts dancing to. the music and i don't know what they're playing but she's [ __ ] bopping and dude i i thought about talking about this. on the podcast and whenever i brought it. up in my head to. me while driving or whatever. the [ __ ] in the living room. i thought well i'm not gonna do the dancing. because it it makes me. insecure even by myself do you know what i'm talking. about people are out there. doing [ __ ] that makes me insecure. not even doing it for. people but by myself and they're out there. doing it like we're paying them. to right have you ever. been out at a place. like a diner i was at a mel's. diner once and busta rhymes was there. but not being bust to. rhymes just eating a sandwich. he was being whatever his regular name is mr. rhymes [ __ ] jack rhymes i don't know. what his regular name is but busta was just sitting there eating something. at mel's diner and all of a sudden a lady comes up to. him and just starts singing. like she's going to. put his like he's going to. put his [ __ ] turkey pastrami [ __ ] down sorry took her swami [ __ ] down and all of a sudden just be like hold up be on the third track on my next album it's just not gonna happen. but people are but she did it. she's saying like we were paying her. for it when in actuality that's not the world. we're in right now right. we're in eating world we're in the mel's. metaverse right all these different [ __ ] it's like figure out where we are and be that way there's dance clubs hey man hi i don't mean to. bug you and i touched you in real life. so apparently you're not an nft but uh there's dance clubs. for that all right take care. but the what the dancing she was. doing was and i don't even. want to do it. alone and i'm alone now. but you guys are going to. see this but this is what the dancing. she was doing she was. going like this like this. ah [ __ ] it's cringy. right and i'm doing it. and if you're just listening thank you. by the way if you're watching i'm sorry. and if you're listening thank you. and you're welcome but she was doing it. like this like like she had two small [ __ ] right like this like just jerking them. and she was doing it. like this and then leaning her head back a little bit jerking. to [ __ ] and leaning her head back what making the two guys [ __ ] jizz on each other not her right that's what was happening because when you're [ __ ] leaning back and you're doing that you're jerking they [ __ ] splash on each other's right they [ __ ] sp whoopsie you spunk down this tip that's what they do not me though and you lean back with it right and so she was leaning back with her doing the dancing and then she stopped and then she did the dancing again and hey i'm just like lady but be in line though hey just be in line it's one thing to have all the outfit and then it's another thing to also amp it up with doing all the dancing that you should be doing in a dance club and that's all i honestly have to say about that many many tentacles but we got to the beak it's just dude maybe i'm jealous because she was so carefree right i think that's the hottest thing a person can be as carefree i think it's the sexiest hottest thing a person can be as carefree right that's why pete davidson is like the [ __ ] man get dating everybody he's dating [ __ ] what's her name mother teresa next and she's dead dude and he just cause he's so carefree he's just like if you ask pete what's up he'd be like ah man whatever hey but we're at war ah man [ __ ] dude do you want this what is that i don't it's a i found it what is it it's a thing i just found well what is it i don't really know but you want it you're like oh god all right let's [ __ ] like that's how carefree is the [ __ ] girls are guys why doesn't it matter though that that speaks to my soul but why doesn't it matter when something doesn't matter to somebody i feel less than and um and that's how they [ __ ] and we all need more of that especially if we want to [ __ ] be sexy right that's what we're all striving to be sexy in a coffee shop [music] so uh yeah man i love it i love it and by the way dude i know i come hard in the uh podcast i know i come hard with it sometimes and you guys are like he's a curmudgeon but i'm not though because i want that lady to do what she does above all. else do what you do. and dress how you want above. all else but also i get to. complain and have a good time. with it right those guys out there. with [ __ ] ascots that's way. worse are those [ __ ] what are those. like remember those taliban. scarves that everybody used to. wear like for nine months. um i [ __ ] i did the king in the sting it's out if you can go watch out. i did king of this. thing i was with eric. uh griffin and brendan schaub and uh i filled in a little bit because i know theo. couldn't be there but i was the guest. on the couch um and uh that. was good we talked you know. they got a good they got a good. show there um i i had never watched. a full episode obviously i've seen. clips but uh i saw the uh i saw the whole episode. that i was in because uh but i saw it. through my own eyes when i was there i didn't watch it. um so you can check that. out i've been doing a lot of watching though. a lot of watching i think you know. what i did the other day. i turned on regular tv. i have that i didn't. even know flipped the channel. and it was like a 8 30. or something and every channel. was about like was about like black people trying. to be a musician or an artist. or something and it was like yeah. it was like the networks. were trying so hard to. not be racist but also being racist. dude like they're hiring i know they're hiring. people of color to. do the people of color. shows right is the guy at the head. still like some white jewish. guy like why is this. happening like i turned on that. show blackage blackit black itch. wow going to. [ __ ] hell i turned on this show. blackish and the lead guy. his name is dre. like dude first of all i thought it. was drake and i i fell out. of my chair i thought it. was drake i thought the guy's name was drake. and then i and then realized it. was dre but also that's still like such a big. hiphop guy like don't name him. that it's i mean i get okay. people of color i hope. they were in charge of this. is all i'm saying and i know they are because i know that. guy kenya barris did the show or whatever. but i hope what he said. goes because i just imagine this white. dude like at the top. that's just like can we call him. dre do you know. what i mean can we call him. is it cool if we leave everything. but we call him. dre and they're like well. i just i like his name. richard yeah but i don't know i just like dre. just not explaining himself some white. jewish guy yeah just like dre. because this was before. probably this show was on the air. before kenya barrows was kinder bear is that even. his name or am i being racist. kenya you know um it's like a [ __ ] my name was denmark um denmark dalia uh [ __ ] north pole. johnson uh so for [ __ ] sake dude. what's a really white place. spokane spokane johnson um so uh so every and then i change the channel. and i know that [ __ ] that i turn on the show. queen queens with brandy. who is i think brandy. by the way is there's something about brandy. that is the most attractive. thing i think brandy. it's so funny too because you like i looked it. up on imdb to. see what the [ __ ] actors and the characters names. were and it's so funny. that on imdb they'll be like it'll be like brandy. and then her last name. too and it's like oh okay. it's all official now right. like [ __ ] it'll be like ella cool. j is in this but also it's james. todd smith and you're like oh oh oh okay right. and uh so so i'm watching this. [ __ ] show queens and it was about the r b rap. [ __ ] world and i'm just like all right it was just so funny to. me that these [ __ ] networks are like just trying. so hard and i'm not saying it's a bad thing. it's a hilarious thing. because like i i i they don't care. they just act like they care because they think their money. is affected right and so they make this show called queens and brandy's in it and the [ __ ] two artists that they're that they're that are in the show. are lady zee and explicit. hey name them better. hey uh try a little bit more. did you give up halfway. through thinking lady z and explicit. why don't you just call. one of them break dude. lady z [music] but there's but there's jayz though. [laughter] oh but there's exhibit explicit. hello and what meet your archrivals. break and bust the crimes [laughter]. and foxy drowned dude. try harder i'm sure people of color. wrote this so stop being so white people of color. dude it's insane man it's insane. dude explicit dude x to. the t it was oh and you oh and you better. believe it was axe. split it wasn't ex. dude oh yeah and we uh yeah. hey what up i'm i'm. this is your rapper. explicit and i got a show. on vh1 pimp my pride try. think further dude it's like this. whole thing was thrown into. an algorithm and it just fired. it out the back. end people running these shows. what what is going on. what what is going on. and people are watching it. look at these are the rest of the names. eve plays prof professor sex that's her. rap name in it that's what it. says jill the thrill at least those aren't lil muffin. i mean these would be but dude. it's just like on it's like and dude. they're saying [ __ ] like yeah and it's lit and dude these people are 40 in it brandy's older than me. you know yeah i'm in the hizzy like what. dude who's writing this [ __ ] like just that's that's why. it's like just do you abc. just do what you're doing. you don't have to. try to do what. you think you should do because it's [ __ ] it's that lady. dancing in the coffee bean. it's it's embarrassing dude. a cringe city it's like. so weird man it's it. i i kept flipping. the channel it was it kept being about [ __ ] hiphop producers dude. oh my god dude it was [ __ ] hilarious. and everything is is turning. into that too it's like it's so weird. this is [ __ ] so weird man. and i'm not saying don't ha. like this is i could so see somebody saying oh crystal making fun. of [ __ ] oh black people shouldn't be on tv like you're a [ __ ] idiot if you think that's what i'm saying you're a [ __ ] [ __ ] that's not what i'm saying but like can't like god god you know what dude it's like and then and then they go on the other end and they do the [ __ ] what's that movie the the movie with the [ __ ] all the black cowboys. and [ __ ] on netflix and it's like okay never mind then they tried to. make black people white too. and also it didn't work. it's like just but of course everyone's reviewing that. somebody said the best. cast imaginable dude i love how i saw that. billboard what's it called the harder they fall is it that [ __ ] movie and they're like best cast imagine dude that's the thing that they're running with best. cast imaginable and in my head. i'm like oh but jiminy cricket. and jesus christ i these. are what do you mean. imaginable gregory peck he's dead. though sidney poitier just died. i'm imagining him though oh cool. you got some guy that was in some movies. i'm imagining napoleon bonaparte though. best case imaginable it at. best best cast alive but also no though. whatever dude i'm too [ __ ] whatever bro it's like dude it's just like [ __ ] lady z dude there's like even with the z. dude um speaking of rappers kodak black did. that thing where he had sex. in the [ __ ] box seat. what is kodak black you know. like he i feel like when he goes to. a place he doesn't walk he just says okay. and just [ __ ] rolls what shape. is he what is he five. tires like what what it. what is what is going. on dude he is a simpson right. like if you saw him walk by homer. in the show the simpsons you. wouldn't even think about it. but in real life you go. oh there are my tires. are you just [ __ ] four trash. bags like what's what are. you who is what is going. on dude i listened to. an interview with him. and he it was so all was unbelievable. dude he was just like you know. what i don't even know but you know. what i mean you know. you're talking a minute that's and then somebody would be like [ __ ] you you don't. even get this lifestyle what lifestyle. the i don't the i don't hear you. lifestyle i you know and like about being okay. like oh yeah you're just you're old you. don't get it that's my favorite. thing you're old you. don't get it no what. though that's why i think that people need to. to be somebody in society. you'd nee you need you don't need to. actually do but you need to. be able to. do more than one. job you can have one. job right as a matter of fact. you should only have one. job and do everything. for that one job but you need to. be able to. do two jobs different. jobs if you can't you gotta just kind of plug in. and be in the metaverse. you can't be walking around. like what else the [ __ ] could kodak black do right. do you know what i mean. like some day trip some some [ __ ] wall street guys you're like oh all you could do is do this [ __ ] dude get out get go in a metaverse with kodak black i'm not it's not a you know

[ __ ] what what beauty mark is that what you call. them juan yeah beauty mark all right. well i call it a beaker. and as a kid when i was a kid. i just thought they were called. beakers like i just i don't. know it was just like it. was already in my vocabulary. i never learned it nobody. ever called it a beaker. i just called it a [ __ ] beaker as a kid. and i was talking about it. with my mom and i was like oh man. my mom i have so many beakers. and she was like what the [ __ ] is a what and i was like a beaker and she's like what's a beaker and i started pointing them. on my arms and she was like she started. laughing she was like you mean. beauty mark and i was like yeah beaker and she's like where'd you learn that i don't know it should be called a beaker dude and so that's what it

same color. as your skin i did. a show i did a show with brendan schaub and uh we did it. in uh it was brendan shaw befriends at the improv. and it was awesome. here's the thing i was watching um i was in the what do you call. it uh i was i was what am. i trying to say i had i i did. a podcast last week and in the middle. of my podcast kristen said she was bringing calvin to. a movie and that i should come and i ended the podcast. and i had to get to. the improv and i couldn't make it i'm like babe. i don't want to. do that and i'm upset. because i want to. be there for calvin's first movie and she was like well i'm with him. out and i never really get time. to like kind of like destress and unwind so i'm just going. to go see the movie. and i was like i would really appreciate it. if you don't you can do anything else. i want to. be there for my son's first. movie and she was like well we're already inside. anyway i was like okay you know i don't want to. make a thing out of it. but i was upset. swallowed it and i um and then i and then i i had to. get ready for the show and then i went to. the to the uh get my coffee. as i do i do my thing. i [ __ ] get in and i do my uh i i do my routine. you know i went to. the coffee bean i got the coffee. actually i think i went to. the [ __ ] starbucks even but i went to. starbucks and i went to. the improv and when i went to. the improv i was uh you know i kind of was thinking about my son. watching move i was like i hope. he has a good time. but i was still kind of bummed out. and i got into. the green room at the improv. and i hear tata and calvin's. there and i just everything. just melts away i'm not bummed out. anymore i'm not upset. and kristen's a hero and he's just da. da da da da and he runs to. me gives me a big. hug and calvin's in there and i almost start. crying and i i put it on my other. youtube channel uh more chris uh more crystalia. and it's uh on the it's the preshow. with chris it's called and um my face even the side. of my face you can see like how emotional dude. i [ __ ] everything else felt fell away. and it was the first now. instead of seeing my son's first. movie it was my first first time. my son was gonna see me on stage. and i was gonna be hanging out with him. in the green room with my other. people who still you know. look it's been a [ __ ] weird two years. for me to say the least. and the other comedians on. the show that were still [ __ ] rocking with me. and that that uh in the face. of fear still support me. um is just was such a beautiful. thing man and that you know. to think that my career. used to be the most. important thing and now it's not my family. is the most important thing. and now i'm at this. show and my family's there. in with two of now. the most important things it. was just too much. for me to even. handle dude it was just so. emotionally uh amazing and i was nervous. for like the first time in a long. time besides the first time i came i came back i started. doing standup i was a little nervous. but dude to have i was like calvin's. not even two and i'm nervous. for this person to. watch me because i want him. to [ __ ] like me i want him to. like me and it wasn't like i want. him to think i'm funny. like he doesn't even. know what the [ __ ] i'm saying as a matter of fact i went on stage and he was just like that he was so confused. and chris was like she watched me. for 30 seconds then he was like trying. to run around and she was like be quiet. be quiet and then just put on something. on the phone for him. to watch i'm like people buy pay tickets. for this [ __ ] i told him. she should just put my specials on that. would have been funny because no matter what if it's on that. phone he'll just zero in on it. but it was such a beautiful. thing man you can go. watch that video on on the more crystallia. channel uh the preshow with chris and uh yeah it. was just [ __ ] really wild. and i love it and i just loved that. moment man and i loved that moment. it's just so much it's so much. feeling you know it's crazy. to be a person. a period actually it's so much. if you let it be you know what i'm talking. about like that's why. i say life rips it's like it. it it's so it's it. really is a feeling of what. you let it be right. like i could have the old me would have walked into. that green room no i didn't have a son. right the old me the the unaware sleepwalking. through life guy what didn't have us it. wasn't when i had a son. but the old me would have wouldn't have necessarily stopped and thought about that. and taken that in i wouldn't have allowed. it because it was too. much feeling right i talk. about how i don't like music. a lot because it's artificially making me. feel these emotions and that's what life. was to me it was you're not. going to make me. feel that way i choose. how i feel but if you're doing that. then how much of the life are you living right. like nobody wants to. be around all day and cry. at every [ __ ] waking moment. there's a lot of sadness. in the world but there's also a lot. of happiness and you need to. feel all of that to. be a person if you're not then you might as well be in the metaverse. and have a jerky [ __ ] foxhead right you might as well because you're not really living life is as much feeling as you let it be and as much as you let it take in because man having my son there. in that green room having my son. there knowing that he was watching his dad. do his job for him. too you know like i actually do it. it was the reason why i went back. on stage it's because of him. i didn't you know i checked. out i was in a bad. [ __ ] place man i did not want to. you know there were weeks and months. at a time where i didn't i was like [ __ ] it dude. so many people threw me on. the under the bus [ __ ] them i'm not doing standup. anymore that's not a community. i'm not in that community i. don't want to. be in that community [ __ ] that i don't want. to be in that community. you know the world has a certain uh uh opinion. of of of me or whoever the [ __ ] has an opinion. of me or whoever the [ __ ] it is uh you don't know who i am. and there was a long time. where i just wanted. to give up and the only thing. that made me get back. on stage at certain points. was my son's gonna be 20. one day or 15. whatever the [ __ ] it is of a mind. to ask me oh hey dad you used to. be a comedian and i would have to. say yeah and he would say well why don't you do. that anymore and i'd i'd have to. say a version of i let the world. get the best of me. or i let people say and believe that. i'm something that i'm not. and i gave up and when it comes. to my son that's just not an option. um so yeah so that's what that's what that. means to me having him. there and that's what that. means to me having him. there with all the people that i love. and still love uh whether that. be you know brendan schaab theo craig. conan chappelle lacy eric griffin you know and i'm just naming. some of them but you know. and my fiance and calvin who uh who knows. me um i love you [ __ ] but that was a nice special day. that i had no idea was coming. you know sometimes you have special days. because you're ready and sometimes a special day. just hits you over the side. of the [ __ ] head that's what that. was i didn't mean to. get so heavy speaking. of heavy i want to. talk about this about uh bob saget. man um it was just you know what the crazy. thing about bob saget. first of all bob saget. he was he was a great. guy i knew him a little um always was smiles. and made you feel like when you're talking to. him he was you were the you know one of those people oh you oh okay. this is bob saget. you know but when i was a younger. comedian he he treated me. like a person which doesn't always happen. with uh bigger comedians and um he we we had a um a conversation. once that um where we disagreed about. something and i walked away. feeling um so taken aback by how he how he handled it. you know um it was by. no means an argument or anything. like that but it was just it. was something that i realized afterwards. if it were someone else and if it was someone else. with any sort of agenda. it could have been such a weird. thing but he made it so comfortable. by being a great guy. about it and it wasn't he wasn't being a great. guy he just was a great. guy he it's so sad. to see him go. because of that energy that he brought to. the world um you know whether it. be on tv or making you. laugh or just even if it wasn't bob. saggy you he would be one of those guys that would be in the room. and you'd be like oh that. guy oh yeah that guy. oh i [ __ ] like that guy like that's that he radiated that really he really did and he was one of those guys too that like it's gonna be a little bit weird. to not have him in the world. like he's been around. ever since i could remember and he was 65. which is young and you just he seemed like a guy that was just gonna be 95 you know. and in 30 years you were going. to be like that was hey yeah bob saget. had his run but he died. too early and it's such a shame. man it really is you know. i didn't know him well but i knew him. and i hope this is coming across the way. i wanted to because you just i don't. know i i just i think it. was a special guys go i think he was a special. guy he had a lot. of friends and i've been texting with a lot. of them you know reaching out. saying oh hey i know this is close. to you i'm sorry. and uh yeah they're all saying how horrible it. is you never heard a bad. word about bob saget. but um anyway yeah i don't know how long i've even done. this podcast maybe i should do this. one more thing i'm gonna total oh jesus. christ okay well i guess we can i had that cool mo d wrapper thing i could do that next time actually that's a good thing to. do next time um all right. well that's that we'll end on. that rest in peace. bob saget you were. a legend you know wow. you were a legend. in only 65
