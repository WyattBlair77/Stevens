[ __ ] killed it dude. it was unbelievable it was so good. it defined a new kind of genre. it changed action movies. it changed cinema now of course. the ancillary uh actors the ancillary characters the people that they cast did they all look like they would be in in [ __ ] they would be poor male porn actors yes they did does it. matter no every single person. in matrix two and matrix three all. the ancillary characters did it seem like they were [ __ ] uh male partners yes. it did find one. ancillary character in the matrix two and three that. don't look like they did. [ __ ] like they [ __ ] on other people's [ __ ] tits and faces and even guys too gay ones too like they did like straight up like the guy it's unbelievable how many [ __ ] side characters in the matrix only look like [ __ ] porn actors it's male and not not female but male porn actors straight and also gay ones dude it's so crazy every white guy that they and and also there's a lot of like mixed race guys they all look like guys that would just be like oh yeah and jizz all over someone else's face whether male or female okay i don't know why the wachowski well sisters did that [ __ ] brothers i don't want to. you know dead name them. god for [ __ ] bid right but they were back then they well they were they were they would say that they were women they just you know had to. come out okay. fine but they were still known. as the wateoski brothers back. then okay fine whatever um matrix two. is horrendous i'm gonna you know i say. matrix three i thought was great. okay matrix one was just all time. two was really bad three. was great that's what i thought. okay so say what you want. about the trilogy but matrix. number one the first one. okay so it was great. so 22 years have passed since the matrix and 60. in the actual world of the matrix. now let me tell you um i watched. this movie first of all neo's in therapy. in the beginning okay i'm not going. to really do many i'm not going. to do spoilers. i'm just going to. tell you about the movie. i haven't seen it um but it's not me. who spoiled the movie. it's the movie that spoiled. the movie okay but um he's in therapy. uh which is so weird. also let me tell you this. too uh keanu reeves he's i you. know how much i love counter. reefs i love cannabis i'll watch him. in anything and i will continue to. do so he's just too old. dude there was one time where he was fighting. doing the fight scenes the fight scenes. first of all they're sucked there's no guns. in them which is so weird. he did the fight scene where he was in the middle. of fighting and he got up. he used his hand on his knee. to get up okay. game over that's it. that's it you're in the matrix. by the way you don't need to. use your knee to. get up your hand on your knee he's too. old he looks weird everybody. acts badly in it. neil patrick harris is in it. the guy from [ __ ] mind hunter is in it they're the new adrian smith and the bad guy dude. it's so weird like neil patrick. harris sure he's a funny. actor but he's the bad guy. in the matrix now bro. this is dookiehouser this is the guy. from how i met. your mother and he's all. like right neo nah dude. the movie's so colorful and so it's so here's the thing. too it's so of the time. it's so ex you know. uh the [ __ ] video [ __ ] neo works he doesn't know he's in the matrix any more and he works and he's famous because he created a video game called the matrix and it did so many numbers because it was basically the movie of the matrix that he then sold into. a video game and he's working on a new. game and they want to. make him do the the sequel. to the matrix video. game so it's so super meta. but also they're using footage. of the actual movie as it. being the video game in the matrix. resolution and it's like they're like well this. is the video game. that you made and it's like got keanu reeves. and that [ __ ] chicka place trinity. in it in the [ __ ] video game quote. unquote but they're just showing the movie and you're watching it and you're just like hey that was the matrix the movie though you're telling me you made this movie it cost 200 million dollars you couldn't make a [ __ ] cgi video game version of the [ __ ] you're just showing the movie it's so and it's like so like here's the other thing too the matrix i didn't know this back then but when i saw this you know the wachowski back then we knew them as the wachowski brothers they were battling with [ __ ] inside themselves they believed they were women they then uh uh what do you call it um changed to. women what do you call. it [ __ ] uh transition to. women and and they did that. and you know [ __ ] good on them man. um and that's awesome and then you watch the matrix. again and you realize that. oh [ __ ] dude this is about people unplugging from the norms of society. in the real world and finding out. that just because this is what people say. the real world is doesn't mean. that you can't become who you want. to be and live as the one. and with and outside of the matrix. it's all a [ __ ] metaphor for trans. politics and there are people who are trying to. like uh you know stop you and make you feel shitty. about it dude. when you watch the matrix. again now in that lens and i looked it. up online too and they were you know. they were saying that one. of the one of the they wanted. one of the actors to. be uh a male in the matrix. and a female outside the matrix. or whatever it was or i don't. know if it was vice. versa but it but but corporate uh uh hollywood. or corporate america warner brothers wasn't um. ready for that so they didn't do. that and it's like to. make this movie this art. uh digestible to. corporate america and have it secretly be about this. this this this trans woman's. idea of what it's like to. be a woman and trapped in a man's. body that is mindblowing that. is amazing that made me like the movie even more like they did. that [ __ ] and it was like haha joke's on you corporate. america i'll make you digest this. [ __ ] and this is secretly about this and then you go and rewatch it you're like oh you're we may meme. in it you're like oh that's amazing. you did it witchowskis. that was killer [ __ ] it was ahead. of its time and you [ __ ] killed it and that's what art. should be whether or not. you believe a woman. was born with a [ __ ] or not who gives a [ __ ] who cares that's what art. is and you [ __ ] nailed it. i don't care if you think you're a [ __ ] grilled cheese sandwich. you nailed it you nailed. it congratulations you're a talent. [ __ ] blue pill red. pill they took that [ __ ] right the right. took that [ __ ] now they mean oh you're red pill. you're you're waking up you're seeing what. the world actually is they don't even know what this. [ __ ] means it was for the left so you bogarted it. fine all good and then they go. and they make this [ __ ] movie where neo's in therapy. and everything's about your feelings he's creating. a video game called. binary and the matrix is just like oh my god. dude this is the worst. movie i've ever seen and i hated it. because i wanted to. want it to. like it i wanted to. love it dude but it's the worst. movie and i've seen wonder woman. 84. that was the worst movie. of today wonder woman 84. and then this movie came out. forget it dude forget it. the whole movie's so gay. ever and i don't i mean. gay everyone in it. is is gay like agent smith is. all that like he's wearing blue. and pink and [ __ ] it's like what the [ __ ] what what are you doing there's no guns. not that it's not gay. to use not use guns. but dude it's so badly active. even keanu's bad in it. it's all weird as [ __ ] anyway i don't want to. talk about the matrix too much. but i did but i just don't know. what they did movies. are [ __ ] terrible now man and i'm still a fan. of the wachowski sisters. i [ __ ] well only lana did this one maybe maybe they need maybe she needs the other one too oh and it's so funny too because people are so afraid to. like i looked up at the onlines that dude. there's no way that anybody in the right. mind thinks this movie is good and like you go. to look at the reviews. and ever and people are like lauding it. saying like oh it's so great. because it's so meta. and it's speaking to. dude they're only scared to. say it's bad because a [ __ ] trans. woman directed it it's so [ __ ] it's so it's so ridiculous dude you see the worst.
