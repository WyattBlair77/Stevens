[laughter] and left it. in there and [ __ ] just went to. watch tv he was like gotta preheat the oven. didn't realize he was regular heat. in the crock pot went. to go i and so i walked over to. dad and i was like dad. and what happened and he said guy. [ __ ] i didn't know i i put the cr that i keep the crock pot in the crock pot in the oven. and i i forgot i keep it. in there and i started the [ __ ] thing to. preheat it and then i realized it. like you know 30 minutes. later i was like 30 minutes later how did you realize this and he's the whole house. smelled like [ __ ] plastic and i was like really where were you and he was like i was watching tv. in the tea room tv. room is clear across the house. so that means that the [ __ ] plastic on the crock pot went over like smoke. tickling donald duck's nose. while my dad was watching [ __ ] combat or whatever. the [ __ ] show he that aired in 1948. that he's watching on [ __ ] the movie channel or whatever the [ __ ] you know and and it's just the croc plastic is just doing this. under his [ __ ] 73 year. old nose and he gets up and it was all melted. so he [ __ ] took the yet that he had to. wait for the crock pot to. cool down take it out. and now he can't use that. oven they got two. ovens so now he's cooking. everything in the one oven. and so we end up eating. at like five and one of the people. in the [ __ ] thanksgiving had to. leave so they didn't even eat and my dad. was so [ __ ] mad dude and when my dad's mad he just goes god. damn it like that's what he does. dude he goes god damn. it so they left. and they're like here it is. i hope it's good i don't know. if it's good i only had one oven. i planned for two. ovens i only i left the [ __ ] crock pot in the thing dude and we [ __ ] ate it and everyone's like wow this is amazing wow this is really good he's like oh good i was worried and let me tell you something dude it wasn't that good okay and i'm coming clean with you guys because i respect you all right the turkey was dry now here's the other thing turkey is kind of always dry that's why you have the gravy that's why you have the gravy i'm not even a gravy guy but i use gravy on thanksgiving because you because turkey is usually dry it's really hard to. cook turkey and i know that because people tell me people close to. me tell me i don't know. that because i cook because i don't cook. because i [ __ ] hate cooking but i trust some people and those people tell me cooking. turkey is very hard and that's why. you have the gravy all right. so i poured that gravy. on there and i still tasted. dried turkey and i drove home. and on the way. home i was like hey dude now can we talk about it. the turkey wasn't good and people were like oh i thought it. was really good and i was like are. you [ __ ] actually serious right. now and they were like yeah i was like you really telling me. that that turkey be busting. and they were like the turkey be busting. and i was like okay. i guess i'm wrong dude. i guess i'm wrong but dude. the fact that my dad cooked the crock pot for 30. minutes and ruined. the oven and asked to. get into a crock pot and ruin turkey amazing. with one click of the [ __ ] wrist. dude [music] you

[music] dude with the feet up. dude like eagles like eagles do like the [ __ ] dangerous ones. the eagles that show their [ __ ] you know what i'm talking about. they're [ __ ] and [ __ ] when they're trying to. get the [ __ ] trout that's me. dude if a doctor sits there. and diagnoses me with some [ __ ] rare. [ __ ] duck duck. this is you this is everybody. around me if your boy gets diagnosed. for real dude i'm serious. business dude i come out. on this podcast turns. into [ __ ] you know what it turns into. for real [music] that's what it. turns into dude. the doctor says mr dalia sit. down yes you have a rare. form of heart cancer and i just stand up. [music] grab him by the lapel. and i'm out dude but it's sad. dude you know we lost. a good one we lost. i loved his [ __ ] i thought offwhite was one. of the better was one. of the best brands because honestly. some of this [ __ ] was this is the best. stuff in life some of this. stuff is awesome and some of the stuff. i'm just like who the [ __ ] [ __ ] is gonna wear that right like the fact that you know virgil. abloh was a good designer. i mean many reasons but the reason. why you know he was a good. designer is because what one of those. [ __ ] uh quavo or quavo whatever. the [ __ ] wore to. his [ __ ] thing the guy had a purple top hat on i don't know which one he is of the [ __ ] group what's that group. called migos the three amigos one. of them were a purple. top hat and a [ __ ] like pilgrim outfit and i'm just like god damn it. the fact that virgil abloh was. able to make this guy wear this. at his [ __ ] just without even saying to. do it with just him. through creating the fact that this dude. from migos showed up in that. absolutely you know that gay. pilgrim outfit that [ __ ] mad hatter it's just so awesome. that that's his that's part. of his legacy made whoever that migo was the worst. dressed person i've ever seen. in my life you know. what i'm talking about like kid. cudi wore a green [ __ ] neon. all neon dude people dressed like such [ __ ] at his [ __ ] thing that even like people from alice. in wonderland would be like [ __ ] let's throw the other like dude. they just dressed with big. sun one guy was blindfolded just feeling. his way around like dude. what what the [ __ ] a guy showed up in a tux. to the back and just walk backward like what are these guys. doing one guy sawed his [ __ ] legs off at the knees. and just said this is what fashion. is now it's just like virgil. abloh had an effect on. [ __ ] and that's cool. right 41. that [ __ ] me up. man that [ __ ] me up when i heard he died you know i didn't know him at all but like um yeah [ __ ] me up man because uh i'm 41 dude and i you know i don't mean to. make it about me. but it [ __ ] made me s weird. all day dude just texting my brother. and [ __ ] and just like it's just weird somebody can be taken from you from in a moment dude and i didn't know he had kids i didn't know he had a wife and kids man you know it's it's it's it's odd. that even a fashion. designer would have a wife and kids. because they're you just assume they're gay. i guess that's prejudice but like man. you know [ __ ] nor mcdonald him. and the [ __ ] chadwick boseman you know it's just like [ __ ] i had a buddy die. two weeks ago. i didn't talk about on the podcast. but it's just like uh it was rough. man anyway hmm i feel like these podcasts. just get [ __ ] sadder and sadder they don't though dude the life dude life is pain life is beautiful. and life is pain. i feel you do it. if you're going through a hard time. if you lost a loved one. i i [ __ ] i want to. be there for you i do i really really want to. be there for you um but i got my own.
