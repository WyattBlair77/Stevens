and he's also his dad. or whatever it is i don't. know god is like the son. of his son or i you know. i don't know i'm not really religious. i kind of checked out when [ __ ] when i was at church. when the the just the singing. is really boring you know. i lose it whenever you sing. it should be better right. like you're talking and talking and like the priest was like and then the you know then jesus. came down to. the [ __ ] well and he helped his brother. paul or something that wasn't really. his brother but everybody's brothers right. because we were brothers in the human. race but paul was down. in the well and then he gave and then he he helped. him with a little plant. that he needed a fruit. he gave him one. single peach and paul made the peach last for nine. years like [ __ ] like that in a in a [ __ ] in the bible. the bible's always given they're always people are always giving somebody one vegetable in its last and he gave him one one of his crops and he and and and and john let the that crop lasted him and his family for 19 years gave. him an asparagus bushel and it lasted john and his family. for 19 years and that's that's that's what the priest. is saying you know. and like all right it's kind of okay. and it's boring and [ __ ] and you're obviously making all this [ __ ] up or someone did because also who wrote the bible. you know what i'm talking. about nobody knows it's like at least. put john grisham on. the cover of it john. grisham dude the writer of the [ __ ] and in his new on the new grisham novel it would be the from the from the writer of rainmaker and the bible. and it would still say. rainmaker first that would be [ __ ] awesome dude. from the writer of of andromeda strain and the bible. comes the firm too too. and um and uh and then they sing. dude but when they sing it's the only [ __ ] speaker that when he starts singing it's more boring. dude you know when david gray. is out there he's just like yeah. this next song reminds me. of it you're just like get on. with it you know he's like i went through. a breakup a long time. ago and you're like yeah. okay get out you're in the [ __ ] third row. just get on with it. though and this is it. leave me a hand alone. and that's when you're activated. right but in a [ __ ] uh church in the catholic. church he's the only guy who gets more boring. when he sings and then jesus. goes down to. the well and gives him a bushel of asparagus. and you're just like wake me. is he trying to. put me to. sleep dude dude any song that's a him. is boring as [ __ ] dude. if you want to. make a [ __ ] song way more boring. him knit up also the it's annoying. there's an n in there. too like songs are supposed. to make the [ __ ] better [music]. and ever and ever so boring. to add the end ever end. ever just he did it. all the time he did. it forever and that's it. did he also do it. end ever yeah cause it's in. the first forever dude. don't make me be redundant. [music] and jesus came down. to the to the desert. and gave mary a sheep. and she made that sheep. last for 12 years just. her and her family. eating that sheep [music] [laughter]. dude everyone's just in the [ __ ] church. in the pews just anyway so let me please. open up your books what's that. oh he's talking again. oh good that got boring. as [ __ ] what was it what page. open up your page is.

[ __ ] song i can't stand that song. dude put the chevron to. the lemon and the rabbits. wouldn't dry and the good old. balls singing biscuit in my this. song i mean that song. is for so for [ __ ] 42 year. old pasty white like chunky. white dudes that have like [ __ ] that that just go like this. a lot dude classic good. oh boy just barbecuing with [ __ ] pants. and flipflops on you know. and so uh they tricked. me into going. to young life and then i didn't do. young life anymore because i'm like i can't [ __ ] sing how many times can we sing around. in a circle dude so i did. the [ __ ] um i did that one ski trip. and then i'd like took a few spills and i was like first of all religion. like it's it's too much. for me and then also skiing. coupling it with an a sport. that's just gonna like i gotta get too. much gear for it. you know what i mean. like it just i gotta like th the fun part. of skiing is like two. percent of it you're on the lift. for forever and ever ah why. would i want to. do a sport where the [ __ ] down time is eighty percent. of it you're on a ski. lift and they don't even. go fast and then you get to. the skiing part and that's only two percent. of it because you zip down. the mountain and you're liable to. hurt yourself and everyone's wearing bright. clothes and it tricks you. into liking it. no i'm not into. it dude and really the only good part. is getting hot cocoa and that's the only [ __ ] part really chicks like about skiing. is being bundled up in the cabin. so what that really means is they don't. actually like skiing they just like being inside. it's like when chicks say they love the rain. but then what they actually do is just huddle. up by the fire. when it's raining out because that means that you actually. don't like the rain if you're inside. [ __ ] you don't even realize it you don't realize what you're saying [music]. well the most annoying podcast of all. time dude oh if you like the rain. then go outside but you didn't stand. in it [laughter] be it. make it make it like that. movie school ties um yeah dude. so i'm i'm [ __ ] you know that's why i'm not religious because i don't like skiing. um but yeah we did. the [ __ ] dude we would do we would do prank calls. i would call people and pretend. i was the lead the young. lifeless the young live leader. talked like this i'm not you know. i'm not going to. tell you his name so you don't look. them up on instagram but um i would go uh i would call people i would call people i would call friends. and people who were eating young. life uh young life because he would always say every time every time you'd see him like on campus. dude who are these [ __ ] guys they would just be like on the high school. campuses these [ __ ] young life dudes they would just be like 32 and they'd just be like hey dude and the dude would always be like hey how's it going wow. i just enjoy your energy. you're just great huh. just always talking about like ah you just put a smile on everybody's. face don't you and he would always say you're coming. to young life tomorrow night you're getting a young life tomorrow. night you coming to. young life tomorrow night dude. and i would just be like i would call. people up and i'd be like hey michael how's it. going just wondering if you're giving a young life tomorrow. night and then i would do this. one thing dude i would call people. i would call people what. an [ __ ] i am i would call people collect. calls from him and i would do that. part too i would just and i would do the whole thing. i would be like i'm gonna make up. his name so i don't say. his real name but say his name. was uh michael sebastian right so i would just be like i would start. it and i would say you know. how it goes you. know how he would say you have a collect. call from and then so i would do but first i would go with my mouth. i would go well wow wow dude. i would go you have a collect. call from michael sebastian press. one two and then everyone knew michael sebastian so that you i'd hear. boop i'd hear one. and then i would say and then i'll wait a little bit and i'd be like and i would go. like this is it going. hey like cut it in like with my own. voice i'd be like get going hey thanks. for accepting your charges listen i was just wondering if you're coming to. young live tomorrow night and then they would be like why the [ __ ] did you call me dude. and then i didn't realize how shitty it. was because then [ __ ] michael sebastian would come up. to me and he'd be like hey you know. you gotta stop calling people and ask. me if they're coming to. young life tomorrow night collect calls. bro but it was so funny. to do it when you were 16. wow. how sh how [ __ ] shitty is that. to do now i realize wow. yeah are you coming to. young live tomorrow night um anyway dude. um wow so bad uh so anyway i did that. let's look at this bad. church singing compilation i've always wanted to.
