 so i was at a restaurant. a diner actually that i like to. go to i like to. go all the time me and the fellas we go. after after doing the show and we have a good. time i would go when we laugh. and by the way dude. when i'm at this. diner or if i'm at a diner. it doesn't need to. be this diner any diner. after i do shows and i'm with other people. that are friends other headliners other openers. other whoever it doesn't matter. even open my courage. that i like it doesn't matter. we have a [ __ ] silly goose time and that's it i got my opener mike who's sitting there probably thinking dumb. [ __ ] like that's crazy. how birds can fly and we don't fly. you know and then i've got my irish buddy. marc who's probably thinking although we're doing the little um do. la okay and i've got craig. who sounds like this and has the most french laugh. of all time because he goes. hey okay and then there's joe the thing about joe. is he looks he couldn't look. more like he's from chicago. he also for some reason. always looks like he's wearing a backpack even when he's not one. of the reasons why i go. to this diner is i like the food. uh who knew the people. there know me they know my orders and [ __ ] i love the food. okay that's the main reason. though food and ambiance is why i go if you're a waiter. or a waitress you can be addicted. me as long as the food. in the ambience is good. or if you're really nice. and the food is good. the ambiance can suffer a little bit. you get there's these three things that i like so this. restaurant has all of them. alright we get i get my i get a chicken. sandwich which is one of my hot. [ __ ] one of the hot shits. i order all the time. i get the tickets and or i get the breakfast. burrito or i get a breakfast sandwich. and you know what i like also. the fries okay so they drop the plate. and i notice that the fries. are different all right. now i love the fries. it's one of the reasons why i go. to this [ __ ] because i love the food. and part of the food. of the fries now everybody at the table we all like the fries. that's why we go these fries. are different and joe with his [ __ ] always commenting on food. [ __ ] he says i got different fries. they look good okay. bloodcurdling anger now let me tell now let me explain. now let me explain me. here okay first of all he's doing the thing. that he always does talking. about food now step. one i take i take one. step up to. anger heaven do you understand. me i'm taking one step up. to anger heaven okay. and the the the waitress goes. like this oh yeah they're just temporary. we're gonna get two old fries. back soon in about a week. but we got these now. he says oh they look. good second step to. anger heaven okay so actually third step that's the second step. when she says they're temporary okay. third step to. anger heaven okay so now let me tell you second step she says they're temporary so now she says they're temporary because she thinks oh joe thinks they look good so now she's going to. [ __ ] think that these she's gonna think about these in a favorable way now we like the fries. already now their new fries. he hasn't tried him at all he just said. they look good now she's got that. positive [ __ ] she could go back into. the kitchen and be like hey fries. are a hit and she doesn't under now. so i say that to. this day i said joe are you [ __ ] kidding. me dude you just said these fries. look good now she's gonna go back. with that positive energy and maybe what if she mentions. it to the [ __ ] cook and we liked let me out do you like the fries. do you like the [ __ ] fries here all the time he says uh yeah they're good yeah i just thought these ones looked good i said but you didn't rhyme so now when she came back i said hey these fries were temporary right and she said yeah i said oh good because i love the other fries and then she walked away and i said i didn't want to. do that i didn't want to. have to do that. but i had to. [ __ ] do that because i had to. level out his idiocy with just blindly saying the fries. look good when you didn't even [ __ ] who gives you [ __ ] what food. looks like so so i'm like i had to. [ __ ] save the day and be like yeah i and he was like i'm just saying it look i don't see the problem and i said yeah okay well let me explain something to. you when you get the fries. here when you get the fries. here do you ever leave. any of the fries on the plate. and he says well no and i said then what the [ __ ] are you doing you're a cuda. bro i looked at him. right in his face i said you're a cuda. i don't even know if he knows. what that means i does. know what it means cuz you know. he's my buddy but dude. that's a cuda move to. just see new fries. bro to just see. new fries and get excited it. was like the end of [ __ ] and justice for all dude. i murdered him bro. and he understood i'm a good lawyer. when it comes to. being at a diner i'm a good. lawyer i represent fries. i'm a good lawyer i represent. dude fries need do you need a union representation. fries i'm here for you man.
