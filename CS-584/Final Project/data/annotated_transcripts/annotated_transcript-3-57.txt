[ __ ] on his own he went through. it he got it or like his dad. or uncle told him that yeah. you know yeah yeah yeah definitely but it sounds. like you're saying it sounds like he was saying. john kemp john kemp and chuck de leon but it's shawn kemp. oh i know and it's shaquille. o'neal and he was one of the most entertaining players. in the nba at the time. yeah jack willie o'neill was one. of the [ __ ] tallest jamiroquai o'neill jamiroquai walls. and [ __ ] uh what's that song uh the jamiroquai song yeah oh no it's so good though. remember the video what's the name of it. uh yeah it was good. dude all right um thank you. yeah let's do it [music]. what we got hi kristin. matt my name is cassie. so nervous but i'll relax i'm calling in first to. say love you both. uh i'm a baby and a log cabin member. um i'm here in savannah. georgia and i'm calling to. ask you both about how to. propose to my boyfriend. three months pregnant he's the greatest guy. i've ever met and i want. to do something special and big and wow him. and i know him well but i don't know what guys. want when it comes to. a proposal whether i'm stealing. his thunder if a woman were to. propose to you wow. how would you guys expect it to. go down would you want it. to be funny or over the top. or very very public. maybe i do it at chris's show. in savannah here on october 22nd. wow goodbye i'm doing it. um but i would love to. hear your thoughts and maybe chris you could tell us. how you proposed to. kristin um that would be cool. to hear whoa okay. you're awesome thank you bye. you're awesome even though that was like that. question was like slanted towards you i think she's awesome. even though she did that. okay well yeah that's okay. to think that she's awesome. even though she did that. you didn't even know you know. what she scented it so hard. towards you why don't you [ __ ] take me so dude. first of all well congratulations she said she's three months. pregnant right oh really that's what she said right. okay yes yeah um i i have never known. a woman that has proposed to. a man uh personally have you i bet. i have i just didn't know. that i'm saying like yeah yeah maybe but like i've heard about it. many times well i've heard about it. i i don't know i don't know i've never known. about it though um that would be good though. definitely do it yeah [ __ ] it why. do you think i think that because like oh i get i guess. there's so much stress on the guy. to get it right. anything she does is going. to be [ __ ] fine but yeah there's no version of him. that would be like you know. i wish she really did it. like this it would have been so much. that's true that's just like anything. you do the only thing that is possible. is that if he's like you've got the macho he's like she's nothing. and he's like i just wish you let me do it. yeah yeah yeah yeah but i do that's what. i wonder i wonder if but it sounds like they have the kind of relationship. if you think she doesn't feel like an insane. person barring that it's like you're almost doing him. a favor i think but if she's three months. pregnant maybe her brain is doing some crazy. [ __ ] but i would also suggest the one thing i do know for sure don't do public. that's never good no you know. what you should do i i she asked. i think she hit it on the head. i think it should be light. and fun if it's a dude. yeah if you're doing like really romantic. [ __ ] and pulling. out all the stops yeah that guy's going to. feel emasculated i think maybe but i don't know. the guy yeah but like even if he isn't though. i think a guy would appreciate it. lighter a little humor and lighter. stuff yeah like yeah like remember in the remember in the [ __ ] um uh goodwill hunting. when uh ra what's the robin williams is. like it's not your fault. yeah and matt damon is like nice. i i know yeah he's like it's not your fault. he's like yeah it's not your fault. he's like dude i know that. like that's where a guy. is if they're they're always have that. much emotion right behind the emotion. and he's not going to. want to [ __ ] crack hard like i felt like a [ __ ] when i was crying at eric's wedding. i got to be good with that. right that's going to. be my thing no that's like a place. where people cry i know. but i'm saying if you do it in a lighter. way it's less like that and the guy is less. i don't you know. i don't i i don't because if a chick was in the [ __ ] goodwill hunting. thing and robin williams was like it's not. your fault a girl would be like i'm so. glad that somebody actually said and that should be five. hours long so what i'm saying. is right sit deeper. and it's fine but what i'm saying. is keep it nice. jovial hey how's it going want to. go to starbucks. by the way what's this. and he goes a ring. and he say it's yours. and then you say yeah. by the way also do you want to. marry me and then say here's your macchiato spin out terrible. idea do not do that. but i agree about the lightness. uh uh yeah i also think the therapy. with the woman would be shorter. because he'd say it's not your fault. and then there's no like barrier. so the barrier of him. being like no i know it. makes it take longer. i don't know like there's no barriers so it's instantly. like the water works yeah. but water works for so long. right because not just because you know. oh i see because women. crash along and then they talk. so much deeper but fine. state right yeah so um yeah and congratulations. you know what i i don't i've never had people. come up and uh on stage. and the guy's obviously not a fan. of mine because he doesn't. watch anything i do because of course you would never [ __ ] do this so thanks a lot guys but um but uh she i think that she i've never had anyone uh do ask them to. marry me that would be wild. if i had a female ask a man. you know i think men probably are like nah. that's my job but then if it actually happens. it's like i'm i'm sitting at my show. sorry i didn't say that. oh no the main part yeah she said yeah. but she said that. i know but you didn't say. i know because i i got ahead. of myself that would be crazy. i don't know i know comedians have. done that and stuff like joe croy probably does it. every [ __ ] he doesn't probably act breaks. and does it but like uh guys you know. yeah before we go for our third. act break i feel like that guy's always doing different. [ __ ] here but thank you boys. to men now we're doing it's like people. are like can you talk. about your son um so uh so yeah so i just um i don't know if i would ever do that. on my on my show. i always felt like the act. was the act and comedians that. did that it's like it's nice. and it's sweet i guess. it is nice they incorporate you like facilitate yeah. you'll be like guys the guy. come up oh i gotta yeah. i guess that's how it would be i don't know. i've never done it. but nah that's not good. yeah i don't think that's good. either yeah don't do it not public. yeah yeah just that's my only keep it. light keep it nice. keep making dinner at home very it. could be very sweet. at home or go. to a place where you might have gone. on like your first date. if it's private some like look out spot. some like romantic spot. as loki and then bust it. as for me kristen said she didn't. want to do she didn't. want to make a big deal. about it at all. like she was like literally i just want you. to like roll over when we're gonna go to. sleep and do it i was like really and she was like yeah i was like okay. and then i i did it. and i was in a a like a hoodie. it was just some i was so nervous. you know i was in a hoodie. and then and like pant like pajamas. and she and i said come outside. i went outside and i asked her. in on the patio. and then she was and then i did it. and then whenever she told the story she was. like yeah he did it. in pajamas it was really cute. and then i felt like man. maybe they don't like they think that i'm being like not and so then i redid. it well you did yeah. i redid it wow i read that [ __ ] mulligan i'm asking i redid it because she said no the second time i redid it and i did it with calvin. and um in front of her. friends when we were taking pictures. for her friend i think her friends. were they were taking pictures. or something for something which one did she like more of the of friends. marriage proposal i guess. the second one i don't i don't know i did. it twice though you get two two bang. for your buck more. bang for your buck. so all right anyway uh good luck. and congratulations on the pregnancy that's [ __ ] awesome [music]. let's go hey mark hey chris my name's lewis. i'm from the uk. i'm 24. apologies for the unnamed. shirt i'm just chilling. at home um i love the podcast. i love congratulations what's like every episode. i love it anyway my question. is right so i'm on a career. path i know what i want. to do um but i just love going. out and partying and chilling. with my friends and having a good time. so my question is like how do i get off. the path of going. out every weekend and just ruining my life i love it. and just focus on that. career goal like how do you just focus on it probably a simple answer but i'd love to. hear your guys opinion thank. you peace out guys. oh [ __ ] yeah dude he's a dick you know what he's addicted to. the life dude he's addicted to. the life that is so [ __ ] ill you got to. get over that though dude. but he's addicted to. the life dude and he [ __ ] goes out bro. that i guarantee you you. see him look at his face. he was hurting all night. that was in the morning. he had a hair coming off of his chin. he'd even redo the video and he probably didn't see it. he's so hungover but my point. is dude he is addicted to. the life that guy more than like i would say what. percentage of the time are your hands. below your shoulders oh geez. 98 nine yeah yeah this guy's probably half. and half half and half. i mean that guy bro. half above him oh man. that guy's addicted to. the life bro i think though. his [ __ ] [ __ ] is fifteen percent. of the time right yeah oh sorry. eightyfive percent above dude to. the life right here the strong. shoulder muscles and then [ __ ] yeah a dick one that still counts with the drinks you have just one count dude addicted to. it [ __ ] coke molly. still up dude 15 dude. and from the time. 11 30 to 2 a.m 45. percent of the time it's like this. wow yes getting his dick. suck his uk i. love it so my shirt. ain't on that but like holy [ __ ] i'm about to. pass off on time. i'm about to. boss off i'm about to. empty me nuts on. time why do british. guys when you do them. sound a little bit like kermit. what's up with that i want. to come over to. my lily pad and [ __ ] finish it off in the back. she's just like your hands are above. your head a lot uh he did say. weekend though so like he's burning. it on the weekends and then during the week. he means wednesday through. the the advice is keep it on the weekends. and have it be something to. look forward to monday. to friday focus on the [ __ ] as you call him career goals. also what do you say. he's 24 years old. is that what he said. he's young as [ __ ] [ __ ] wow dude that [ __ ] sweet life is catching up to. him he looks [ __ ] 29 but that [ __ ] will slow down the desire to. be [ __ ] dude and be [ __ ] up all the time will will burn out on its own but just keep it to. a minimum in the sense that keep it. on the days that it's supposed. to be for burning. away on the weekends on the weekdays. you keep it about the career. this is like a [ __ ] state he's like you know he's like he's like a new york. if this was he's in america. he'd be like a new york. stock dude stop yeah change like a [ __ ] wall street dude. that's what we want though. we want the hard. work during the week. and then on the weekends just burning. it out and then one day coming. in like a zombie. but by friday you feel kind of healthier. and refreshed for the [ __ ] weekend you're living for the weekend like [ __ ] every other song says but he he says he knows what he wants to. do so maybe he likes his. job too i really wonder what his. job is i wish he said yeah. who's like what's your job. he's just like right. yeah well then that's gonna kind of i love. throwing burgers at doors. what's with you and things. being why do you insist that they throw the food. at the door they don't. give a [ __ ] why drive by they go. what happened to. you with doordash why do you insist that that's true. i don't use it you. don't even know postmates is. the worst you literally don't even. know i don't know no. i saw memes dude. the worst way to. learn [ __ ] i understand i saw memes um dude no postmates is the worst dude no not they're the same thing. they'll bring the food to. your [ __ ] door bro they deliver it in wrong places. and i go nuts. i actually like not at your door. where do they go. oh bro they don't even put it at a door. sometimes so where did they where do they put it like i [ __ ] got out. once it was like on someone's lawn. they don't give a [ __ ] dude. they put it in one. of those [ __ ] tree holes. at the keebler i was leaving. living you got shitty shitty. shitty door dashers and postmates. bro do you think and no knock dude. i mean it's hard. out there you got to. get hard getting a job. but like people who do ubereats they don't want to. be doing ubereats so they're just like you know. what i mean well they're not. going to be doing it. long if they do that [ __ ] they're going to. complain and they won't be able. to do it anymore. bro and then i try not to. [ __ ] complain and i don't want to. [ __ ] i i want to. still tip them but it's like i try. real hard not to. do that too yeah i don't. have to do a lot. do you just do it. right some and then you go call. them and then they're like i don't actually. i'm like where's my food. and you see the picture you know they leave it. with the picture oh yeah yeah and you're like this is not a place. i've seen wow weird that's not. that's never happened it's not. a place i've seen i went up. and down the last one. i went up and down my street. i looked at every place. oh the food was not there. oh bro i was so mad. i ordered it again

both so fat like [ __ ] the next day yeah it was two salmon that's kind of a mystery case yeah it was annoying as [ __ ] anyway very weird you wanna do another one hey matt and chris love the show i'm gonna cut to. the point because i've made this video so many times and i keep screwing. it up i recently. discovered that my husband chews on. his own dead skin and just disgusts me. his hands were peeling. he was biting it off. chewing on it between his teeth. two two two spit do it. again um he also if he has a cut he licks. the blood and says he's putting it back. in his body it very much. grosses me out i mean. i told him it's disgusting. how to do it. in front of our children. and he said that. it's normal everybody. does it and basically that. i'm being dramatic i guess. so i'd like to. know is it normal does everybody. do it is it a guy. thing or is it. disgusting and how do i get this. out of my brain to. save my marriage thanks guys uh it's not a guy. thing unless they're under six years. old yeah it's definitely not. normal no that's not it's completely. abnormal yeah and i would say get a divorce. i would say get a divorce. that's pretty harsh yeah but get a divorce. that is it would teach him. a lesson not okay. be harsh why is he trying. to gaslight you about it. to me like it's totally normal. everybody does it like what. like you're not it thinks it. is like you're not alive. in the world why does he think that no. one does that maybe i don't know. there's [ __ ] reddit groups you know. what i mean i guarantee. there's a reddit group uh [ __ ] skin. chewers yeah but they're not normal. members of society out in the world. this is like a [ __ ] stephen king that's disgusting. dude that is not only not normal. that is [ __ ] disgusting. uh it's it's gross. i i don't find it. that disgusting i would i would borderline throw up. if someone did that in front of me. eating their own chewing on their own. dead skin not even. eating it digesting it. is one thing just like getting it. down and [ __ ] colored a whole. other thing is just like like it's gum. well i don't think she said he swallows. it that's even worse. he should swallow it he's chewing. on it that's pretty weird. dude maybe you know what honestly. look at him and be like eat mine. too i'm your wife if i have dried skin. i want you to. eat a bowl of mine. with milk otherwise stop doing it. it's not fair he'd probably get a [ __ ] heart. on he just goes he's got a ringer. get the get the two percent. bra yeah just with the [ __ ] dead skin oh god yeah yeah i mean it's disgusting. just thinking about it makes you want. to [ __ ] throw up um i'll tell you something okay putting blood back in your body by yeah licking it is not a thing that's not well no it doesn't

wine bar ended up drinking laughing. having a really good time. you know one of what if he's gonna be doing dates. and then the check arrives and we both put out. our credit cards and she looks at me. and says should i put my credit. card and i'm like do whatever. you feel like that was my honest. response oh boy honestly and then the waitress approaches and she elegantly kind of takes her card back because she likes you and pushes her at the end of the day i was like ah that sucks it really turned me off you know yeah that would turn me off too but also i wonder how uh you guys would have handled it or if you have any thoughts about this piece a disguise why would that turn you off because first of all this guy this guy he i love how he is so where do you think he's from eastern like like wherever he's from he's so from there i think he's [ __ ] algerian that he's like he i just speak my mind like i say do whatever you feel like and he was probably like this guy like just i get the sense that this guy was just like i don't um i don't i would love to. pay because i am a member. i don't want to. make you feel uncomfortable yeah like that's probably what's going. on his head so he was just like do whatever. you like and then she took it as oh the the problem. with that is he's putting it on her. yeah so he's putting two things. on her that and also the he's not paying as the man. which i understand that's traditional it. doesn't have always had to. be that way it's fine. if you want to. go dutch but he [ __ ] up by speaking. his mind this is one. of those times where he should have. just said i got it. yeah don't worry about it. yes and he didn't do that. and that made it a little more. awkward so now when she took and here's why it. turns me off so my instinct. okay one of the i by the way. i would always pay for dinners. if i was on a date. like i just that that. would be my goto right. yeah that's not you didn't. say the right thing yeah right. but i like how he was being him. and i like how he reacted to. what he said he was like that. was just what i said it. was on my mind yeah. if sh but um he i think i [ __ ] i forgot i lost my train. of thought go ahead i forgot my. trade of thought yeah i mean. i i don't know why. that turned you off oh i think that okay. go ahead i it it turns. me off when i will always pay that's it's fine. if you that makes you uncomfortable you want to. do both whatever yeah like. um i feel like i a cheap. person turns me off and i'm not saying it. she's being cheap because she very well. may have been like this. is a date i don't want to. pay because you know. what i mean um and the fact that she took it out. in the first place anyway. was actually thoughtful right yeah uh but maybe it turned him. off because i don't know why. it turned him off but for me. if somebody if i sense somebody is cheap. it's a turn off but that. doesn't mean it's cheap. you're right you're right i could have mean. a number of things you're right. the more i think about it. her asking him that. is basically her asking him. what is this what are we doing. yes yes yes and yes we figured it out. together it wasn't just you and him. saying i don't know whatever. you want is like not it's deflecting the question. she's asking him what is this. where are we that's right. or what what is this. and he said i don't know. whatever you want and that's like and then even more like she could. have been saying no no. this is a date. i'm taking my card back so she could have been doing. a number of things correctly and he is not only getting it. wrong by [ __ ] not saying the right thing in the first place. but then being turned off. by the fact that she's saying no. no this is a [ __ ] date i don't think she's saying uh i mean maybe she is but the guy's [ __ ] so handsome i don't think she was like oh i'm gonna get a free drink. out of this or whatever it was right. right right i mean she could be a [ __ ] yeah if she was a hoe she wouldn't mean to. take the thing out at all. right the card out at all. if she meant if she was an actual escort yes she would no just like no. not that but like a hoe that's just like trying. to go get free. food dinners and [ __ ] what the [ __ ] does that oh you mean a hobo oh dude have you ever been in l.a yeah just trying to. get you you mean there. are people out there. who ju who go. on what otherwise appear to. be dates with people they are not interested. in just to eat yeah. i don't know why he doesn't get it. okay guys back sorry against world. records just call me. dude why would they do that. that's so boring and not like 100. percent [ __ ] be like you the other night and get taco bell dude that that save yourself a night because of hoes. want to be out and they want. free meals hoes want to. be out and they want free. meals with and they want to. be seen in dresses and [ __ ] dude have you been in la have you met hoes. guys i'll call you back. dude i know he's never met. one hoe yes unbelievable. it was guinness book sorry. i don't i don't know anyone. like this i'll be perfectly. honest i i have to. i have to say. i don't know what that person. is well the i'm i'm learning. now so some of them. they don't even know they're doing. it they're just like i think maybe i like them. and they're just like oh and then eating and [ __ ] in her [ __ ] town gold sequin dress okay bye dry dick gets in the uber he paid for and [ __ ] hits on the uber dude just go to. [ __ ] taco bell get like a thing for getting we don't want taco bell. why do they want to. go and i'm sorry i'll call you back. two hours dude two hours. with someone they don't give a [ __ ] about just to. eat yes dude if they're rich. or if they're [ __ ] hands up dude that sucks those people suck i don't know what's up oh suck but that's not all just literally implied like there's some kind of like sex involved no this is like this is a whole. boat this is a hobo. this is a hobo hoes want. free [ __ ] hoes want free uhhuh. this is the common misconception. with a hoe dude hoes don't necessarily. [ __ ] we don't nobody gives a [ __ ] you're using the wrong word no no i'm changing the lexicon you can't you're not allowed. to do that you can just make up. a meaningful award i mean. i've kind of done that over. the past few years. but i'm saying someone is a no. one should be allowing you to. do that because that's just confusing. when you say i think that's shorthand. for like escort it's like it's like if a ho. okay if a hoe is like if a girl is like if a girl has so many like they say so many bodies. right this year if the girls if the girls had sex. with 30 guys this year and it's [ __ ] april right. and you're like whoa yo you [ __ ] a lot you're a hoe huh. and you're like i just [ __ ] whenever i [ __ ] a lot you know i [ __ ] yes i agree that's not a a hoe is like i don't know no not really and then [ __ ] and they [ __ ] you know what i mean nope uh it's a lot whose lie is what i'm saying who's lying they're liars and they're hobos yeah okay i mean this person you're describing acts way more like a a homeless person or someone who's just completely broke that's just trying to. [ __ ] eat for free they have homes but they're [ __ ] often paid for by dudes like this a girl that [ __ ] a lot is not a hoe but my problem is that a hoe is something in the world sure i get what you're saying but i'm changing that okay because escort his escort that's what i thought you were describing that's not what i'm describing okay uh anyway what the [ __ ] was this person talking he should have said honestly when she said when she said do you want me to. pay with my credit. card too he should have. said how wet is my dick. going to get tonight no he should have. just said yes if he wanted. her to and no if he didn't want. her to that's it. him saying anything wishywashy is a [ __ ] shitty. response no or yes that's the way. to [ __ ] answer that question. because you're answering is this. a date or is this. not a [ __ ] date can i put my dick in half. hard does that work yeah. i mean that would have answered. you some questions as well then she would and then she'll write. down yeah and then she takes it right. out and it takes right. out and goes like this. good then it will be fully hard. okay you want to. have heart dick pay you will not be having sex. oh [ __ ] who does that sound like that sounds like uh uh [ __ ] tony shalum and something what is that [ __ ] i don't know man you can't call monk no no no i'm not monk all right cool what's the next one let's do it baby stud wow this got peaked in high school. no doubt i can't chris. big fan been listening. to your podcast since day. one been to. a bunch of shows hell yeah. um he's not wearing pants matt. it's been awesome to. get to know you more. um i've been living with my best. friend which has been awesome except for one. major exception he's got into. a relationship recently and they have no boundaries. they literally spend every second and minute. together and being his roommate it. affects my life and interferes with. my life a lot and that hasn't. been great i'm just wondering what you guys. think of how i should be dealing. with that and i can also tell you know. he's not 100 himself he's. not really taking care of himself. and you know i just want to. know what a supportive friend should. do in this case. wow what a nice guy. thanks a lot well great. out of hair too handsome dude. nice low angle looking strong. yeah um i don't know. dude i think definitely bringing up with them. i mean this is your home and something's going. on that is bothering you and making you feel. like you're being smothered or sort of your space. is being pinched a bit. and so just bring it. up with him and be like can't you guys. like go to her place. or something like this. is kind of annoying the second thing. he said concerns me. a bit more what do. you think he means by the way. yeah like he's not beating himself. i don't know i i got the sense. that then he said not taking care of. himself yeah though that's that. maybe he just meant like he's like uh his friend. is like not obsessing but like letting his other priorities. fall by the wayside because he's in love you. know if it's a new relationship. it might even out though. dude you know what i mean. like yeah yeah loves someone it's like [ __ ] the whole time. and then yeah but uh yeah i i think that uh you bring it. up but i also think that you know. if he's encroaching boundaries. then [ __ ] you got to. do the same bro it's all that working yeah. in an apartment dude. it looked like an apartment. it was yeah okay well all that. warfare yeah all that warfare and what does. that mean to. you uh you walk around. with a towel on you you know you pop. in you sometimes they're [ __ ] and you know and you open the door. like you're trying to. get oh i'm sorry i had no. idea you know what i mean. sorry but you know. you're always here and it's just anyway i'm gonna grab toothpicks or walk. around without a towel on that. is yeah it is your house. it's your [ __ ] house it's not starbucks. that's what you should do. do [ __ ] that's like borderline if you if you were to. have guests yeah but then if it's like and then the roommate or or his partner. could just be like hey why are you. yeah walking around with no. pants like i'm home oh you know what the perfect it's not my guest. i'm home that's great but you know. what the perfect thing is. you know that thing that people do. in the backyard or on. their patio where they [ __ ] they they. let the sun in their anus. where they fall oh yeah oh yeah put their chest. on the ground oh yeah. do that a lot yeah. receive the sun in your anus. yeah and when and don't draw. the blind let them see out. into the [ __ ] patio if it's an apartment even better dude yeah there's just like a little patio and he's just out there trying to. receive the sun with his anus. yeah dude and that uh will very quickly. you'll have way more of a boundary. because they won't be there. a lot i think that that's great. receive the sun with your anus. on on that note. i actually knew a guy. who put it was he went. on craigslist and for three dollars. he would allow people to. come over and stick. their ass toward the sun on. his property and have the sun pour into. uh their anus on his property. for three dollars seems like it. should be more than that. but what i'm saying is free. regardless of the price he should start doing that and then when the roommate complains yeah and the roommate complains just be like well you always have your partner over i'm just trying to. these are my sun receivers these are my friends. yeah i make a little money. on your side this. way oh you don't like it. okay well then let's talk about etiquette. well i made nine dollars how much and how much did your [ __ ] break that's going towards rent yeah right right right yeah um he also would charge five dollars if they wanted to. come [ __ ] in his yard. hmm so it's it's definitely sexual. because he's not charging. enough you know he's not not even close. to enough yeah no no. dude i'll take your dick. for a dollar those things. those things uh should both require more. money wow dude i've done. it done which one receiving the sun. with my anus oh yeah me too it. feels amazing yeah it does it really really oddly feels amazing. yeah it does to. take your pants off offer the sun. your anus get the right. direction to the sun and you feel. so warm yeah it like warms your whole. body yeah it's crazy. weird yeah it's like it's the sun sneaks. into your butt and warms you from the inside. i also have [ __ ] in my friend's uh uh yard. well i've [ __ ] in so many yards oh okay well don't oneup me. like that all right i'm the yard. [ __ ] yeah on the way to. see eminem i shouldn't and [ __ ] someone yeah no not his oh oh yeah i remember that yeah yeah i mean [ __ ] it was brutal. dude i've told him. plenty of times on podcasts but it sounds. brutal yeah the [ __ ] worse with the drive oh [ __ ] guy i still get mad about it the driver that was driving us i was like you gotta pull off right now i gotta go to. the bathroom dude and he pulls. off he was gonna go right. or left there's a hospital. to the right. an open road to. the left he turns. red he turns left and i was like okay. well you got to. pull over now i'm using the yard. yeah i mean it was imminent. dude yeah mountain lion open. road you mean what just like houses. and too many things like what. about where are we going. oh it's a [ __ ] hospital like a residential street even if i [ __ ] my pants on the way into. the hospital i'll be we'll be able. to clean up they have all. supplies and they won't get arrested. yeah yeah anyway all right. let's do the next one. yeah hey chris and matt. i absolutely love the show. it's hilarious it's probably one of the only shows. that i listen to. that i'll actually laugh out. loud from oh yeah um but i have a nine month. old baby she's amazing in every way. we love her so much. um but my husband and i are at a point. where we're like okay. she's going to be our first. and our last baby. um are we going to. have another baby or you know. are we going to. be one and done. um you know kind of don't want to. go through the newborn phase. all over again and kind of start. from scratch um we're finally like starting. to get our life back. on track yeah um so i wanted to. ask you guys you know. do you think it's important. to have a sibling in your life. or you know what are the cons. of being an only child i already we're already. getting the comments from people saying oh you know. she would be so lonely. or she'd be spoiled and you know. she'd resent you guys. you know in the future. or whatever um i think there's tons of perks to. being an only child but then i see your guys relationship. and i think you guys balance. each other out super well and you guys. obviously have a great relationship. so i wanted to. see what you guys thought. you know are we being selfish. for not giving her a sibling. or you know for her to. be an only child what do. you think thanks i mean. not being selfish. you're absolutely not being if you don't want. to have another kid don't ever. do yeah do not listen. to people who are like they're going. to be that uh what the [ __ ] yeah do other people know about what your kid's going to. be like yeah do what you want. to do do not get pressured into. having another [ __ ] yeah if the one kid sure feels right then that is right period. the end your kid's gonna be [ __ ] fine if you love her is it a boy or girl i forget. i died i don't think i said anyway yeah. your kid's gonna be [ __ ] fine if you're good parents. it doesn't matter how many siblings. they have they could have zero. or five um i what if at the end. of that you i looked over. to you and you were in tears. looking at me um i think that. i think that so here's what i think. yeah i agree 100 with you. there it's so funny. that she's like our life. is getting back on track. dude that's biology man. this is biology and i'm gonna [ __ ] tell you this right. now and this is crazy. because this is what's happened. to [ __ ] chris this is what happens. to pregnant people like the ladies and [ __ ] uh you because kristen like she did not like some some women like pregnancy you know they they love it they think it's it's great they seem so crazy to. me they get catered to. they feel nurturing you know. and um and uh kristen was just like i can't wait for this. to just be done. right i feel like i remember that. yeah and so calvin. came out and he and she was like uh i can't i i i know i want to. have more kids but oh my gosh. right i don't know right. right i remember that for sure. as the months progressed it. was just still no no. no no no no and then once they get to. be two or something like that. three four you for you literally i was reading. about this biology makes you forget. about that so you'll have more kids. yeah i don't know how [ __ ] uh true it. is because it was an fhm magazine. but that makes sense we are wired. we are wired to. just produce produce people more people but yeah so so here's my point. is that's pro that is i feel like likely. gonna happen to you it. seems like she's a very sweet. kind of nurturing seems like. she's a good mom to. a ninemonthold right if she's being thought very thoughtful right. yeah so but um here's another thing. that i think and i was talking to. my friend michael batz who's a [ __ ] talented. comedian i saw him at eric. griffin's wedding and he was like dude. if you want number two do it. soon do it soon don't wait he was like think about in the future. when they're 13 and 10 or 13. and 11 think about the life. you want think about what you want. and and do it soon. if that's what you want and that. was a really good piece of advice. that he told me. because i i never really thought of it. that way i just thought do it. when you feel like you want to. do it again well that's what i think so tell me why i'm wrong. because we're three and a half. years apart i love that. we're not too far apart. yeah and we're not you know. closer would have been fine. i feel like but um i just feel like if you have a 12 year. old and a six year old that's totally fine. but it's a it's a different thing. than having siblings that are. right next to. each other and if that's the life. you want fine but if you want. more and you want the siblings. with what she's talking about. to have that connection i think doing it. sooner is better i don't think she should have. another kid well i mean maybe she shouldn't but i'm just saying. if she if she wants to. what she said about. we're finally just now getting our life. back is sticking in my head. and i feel like that's how the thing starts. what i first said what what. do you mean that's how the thing starts. we finally get our life. back and then okay good our life's. back and then oh i want another kid. um well it's a slow thing. but if that's the case if that's where she arrives then obviously they should have. another kid but it just go. off of whatever the [ __ ] is in front of you and in your own mind. do not go off of what. other people what is with other. people other people yeah but the fact that she's saying we just got our life. back together we don't know it. means that that's gonna happen. to her like when you ask people. who only want one kid. who have one kid after you're gonna have. more they go no one. and done yeah i just i i just think that that's where she's swaying. yeah that's all and i'm sorry. to not make this utterly. [ __ ] hilarious but sometimes you gotta get real yeah you gotta you know me dude sometimes you got to. be super real yeah sometimes you've got to. be super real right upside down head. ah wait wait we know this. guy hey man chris this. is cory from missouri. calling in again uh i don't know if you guys necessarily want. people to like update. on past calls yeah. you like that but i just thought i'd throw it. out there we'll find out because uh since my last submission that. you guys put on the show thank you. for that by the way. somebody oh yeah crazy. [ __ ] has happened the kid oh the kids oh right if you recall it was about uh my girlfriend's mom yeah trying to. undermine our parenting and taking family. and all that stuff and you're right. you had a good point. that the term uh toxic. can get thrown around. a lot and doesn't necessarily carry. a lot of weight sometimes. but let me paint a picture for you. so uh since my last call. her mom made up some [ __ ] about her being addicted to. pills and suicidal and all this. stuff that was completely untrue and uh used it. to manage to get her. committed to a mental. facility on an involuntary hold. cops showed up at the house. and took her away from her. kids and while she was in there. for two days it was supposed. to be four but they released. her after two because it was clear. she wasn't supposed to. be in there while that was going. on her mom also got a restraining order. against her and emergency guardianship. of the girls claiming that she's trying. to help her and that she isn't fit as a mother. which is completely untrue and this judge just signed. off on all of it. and now we don't have the kids. and so now we're having to. get a lawyer and jump through. all these hoops and legal. loopholes and [ __ ] just to. try to get our family. back together at home where it belongs. it's absolutely bonkers to. me that someone could be so evil. against their own family. and think that they should be in control. of everything when it has nothing to. do with her and so the reason. i'm updating you guys is you know. we're taking the steps doing everything. we can to. get them back um and she's handling. it like an absolute champ. but in the meantime i guess. the advice i want now is uh how do i frame. this in my mind how do i handle. the stress of this day. in and day out when i still have to. go to work and there's nothing we can. do on the weekends and the legal. process is so slow and and and now i'm just rambling. and i understand if you need to. cut this short or if it doesn't make it but i just had to. i just thought you guys might want. to know so uh where where do. we even go from here. thank you guys for doing. this show it's awesome i appreciate you. uh doing what you're doing. and more power to. you hope to see you live. sometime chris maybe if you come down. to missouri we'll see. i'll be there but anyway have a great. one um dude sometimes they're just cory dude. [ __ ] man whoa so hold on sometimes there are just villains in the world dude sometimes there are actual real villains in the world whether it's mental. [ __ ] uh imbalance some kind of chemical imbalance that this woman has or whatever the [ __ ] i don't know but that is just an actual villain person there's no villains it's that is a villain dude she thinks she's doing the right thing that doesn't make her a nonvillain yeah but i mean okay so let me get this straight the the mom called to. get the daughter in a mental. hospital correct and then she was released. in two days correct but she still has custody of the kids. because of this in those two days she got an emergency right. uh i forgot what the word. is yeah yeah but emergency so guardianship of okay. so and then does she still have so now. they have the kids no now. the mom has the kid. the mom the grandma has the kids. the grandma has the kids yes still yes. that's what i'm saying sometimes. there's villains dude well you just and eventually. you will win but don't do anything. [ __ ] stupid because as you say the the law. moves really [ __ ] slow eventually you will your wife will get the kids. i know but there's nothing he can. do besides do the thing that you have to. do he's the same one. his wife is the same. one keep doing the [ __ ] things you got to. do legally properly and eventually. you will get the kids. back it's terrible but sometimes in this. world you gotta you gotta live. with the fact that there are real [ __ ] villains out there. who will be villainous and it will. [ __ ] ruin your life. the the honestly this is just the [ __ ] that you have to. deal with right now. and it sucks yeah right. so sometimes you just have to. say that it'll be over you. just gotta keep showing up. keep going to. work keep going back keep trying. to see the kids keep being with your wife. or whatever it is baby. mom and um that is just insane. man my heart goes out. to you dude that is such something. that just doesn't need to. happen and we did say. toxic is something you throw around. but this sounds like maybe it's a good. fit i mean this is crazy. dude wild piece of [ __ ] the other advice. i would give you i know. you're heavily involved and you love. these kids and you [ __ ] hate. this woman as you have every right. to do but imagine the position. and i'm sure you have the position. that you're that your wife. is in or whether it's fiance. or wife or whatever. it is happening to. you but even more than it's happening. to you it's happening. to her dude you gotta [ __ ] be there in every possible. way for her we're talking last. time he called in he was talking. about how do i be the father. to her kids that uh mom and stuff. this is how you do it. dude you'll be there when it matters. the absolute most and nothing could possibly. matter more right now and to. go off of what you're saying. here's a chance you have yeah. these kids are young. here's a chance you have to. show up for them. in the right way and to. when they get older. and when you explain everything. that went down they know that. you were doing the right. thing and that you were being a good guy. so in a way this. is a gift yes dude reframing i've been trying. to learn reframing through therapy. and [ __ ] yeah and the other thing about there being villains in the world. is that that means they also can be [ __ ] heroes so you get to. be a hero right. now i mean so if you want to. reframe it then there you go. but i'm telling you dude. just keep doing the things. legally that you have to. do keep going down that. path because you don't want. to [ __ ] [ __ ] up or upend anything that is going in your direction you're eventually going to. get it to. go your way but there are crazy. people out there who say. crazy [ __ ] you tell crazy. [ __ ] lies and you're dealing with one right. now just saw just saw batman. you know just saw that i never saw you. can't stop talking about villains so what. do you think about that. what do you think about that. i never saw it. what do you think about that. well it's been out for months. what do you think about that. there's something you never saw it. you say i haven't what do you think about that. though i'm telling you oh okay. hi chris and matt my name is maddie and the issue. that i could use some advice. with is that i hold all. of my value in what other people say. about me so i don't think too highly. of myself i need constant like. assurance that i am doing. a good job that i am on. the right path in life. so that kind of leads to. me being like this big people pleaser. and not really knowing how to. act around these people that i'm supposedly friends. with so i won't get into. too much detail because that is for me. and my therapist to talk. about but i was kind of curious. as to what you guys. say and how you think that i could authentically be myself. which is something that you guys. talk about a lot on your podcast. so just let me know. what you guys think you know. i i dude i what is what a question. i i do talk about that. a lot of my my podcast. things as life moves. on things become more. important things become less important. and it's hard for me. i i realize that i do hold. weight in that as well like i do care. a lot about what other people. think and um i don't uh i don't really like that. about myself i i always go. to the negative like i think i have this. [ __ ] problem i walk into. a room i think it happened the other day. i walked into this. place i'm like oh that person probably hates me. and they came up and they're like hey man. i love your [ __ ] he's a big fan. and i'm like dude i gotta drop this. [ __ ] right and and and and the point is um like my therapist told me once she was like do you love calvin and i said yeah and she said why and she said i said i don't know just because and he was like exactly he's like he just he's him let him be him he's you know he doesn't have to. be anything you don't have to. be anything for people to. like you she's sweet. as [ __ ] yeah i mean she's such a sweetheart. and i i understand that want dude. i'm a comedian you know. i'm a comedian and a [ __ ] addict like i look for it. everywhere i want people to. like me because i don't feel [ __ ] i don't feel. good a lot you know. these walls that i've built up. over the years being on stage. and [ __ ] yelling at people having convincing them. to like me and and and like trying to. like you know uh just like get girls. and women to. like me it's just like it. just it just it's it. you gotta you gotta drop that. and it's so hard. and i'm glad you're in therapy because you know dropping those. walls for me was a big. thing and it's hard and it's a struggle. the whole time i mean i still i'm 42. you're much younger than me. but i'm 42 and um it's [ __ ] hard to. it's hard to. be authentically you because you lie. to yourself a lot. and and and it's hard. to even know who you truly are. at least for me and i do a lot. of [ __ ] thinking about that a lot of soul searching and i can't do it all the time and i get caught up. and i i i want people to. like me and then i realize i have my family. i don't need that i have you. you know what i mean. i don't know how do you feel about. this [ __ ] i think two things one you don't we don't really control who we are or what we are the ways. that we are as much. as we think we do. in fact we don't at all. we are the way that. we are so for even you to. have a judgment on. that is utterly pointless. but for other people to. have a judgment on. it is even more [ __ ] pointless. you just are the way. that you are and yes you can control. your actions so to. speak and like you don't have to. do the bad thing. you can stop yourself from doing something. bad to yourself or to. others but that doesn't that's not what i'm talking. about i'm talking about the way. that you are nobody did that. you didn't design that that just is the way. it is that's the first part. second part is everyone's dealing with. the same [ __ ] thing everyone's going. through a version of what you're describing. and so the realization that i think for me. when i go through these things i get so deep down. in the whole of that. the whole that is my own. mind but everybody's going through. a version of it. as well so the fact that you're kind of doing this. thing you feel like you're doing. it on your own in a sense. you are because there's only one you and that is you but everyone is. doing their own version of it. so you're in it along. with everybody else and there's this sort of like feeling. of unity and this feeling it's like less. dramatic and severe when you can sit back. and realize oh wait everybody's in the same. position everybody in this entire. [ __ ] room or this. entire setting or whatever the [ __ ] is thinking about uh did i do that. right did i do that. did i do this other thing. right does that person hate. me does this person like me uh do i look [ __ ] stupid right. now did i just sound stupid. when i said that. the whole [ __ ] thing everybody's doing it and you know the people that aren't doing that. tend to be [ __ ] sociopaths so like you're you're doing it right don't worry though about uh any kind of the extraneous [ __ ] everyone's going through. what you're going through their. own version of it and that to. me is this sort of like freeing. thing that sort of gets me out. of the hole that is my mind. um yeah and other people's opinion. on you uh that's none of your [ __ ] business that's a saying that. i like to try and remember um did. john lennon say that no no. it's like a [ __ ] addict thing. oh um but yeah so that's what's up. uh yeah so that's good. we kind of ended on not a funny. did you ever see blue. chips um i have some great. tips i thought yep i saw him. a sheep uh all right. well let me just plug my. dates now that i'm gonna be in grand prairie texas. i'm gonna be in dallas. uh so that's gonna be great. tickets are are there uh chrisleya dot com. dallas is grand prairie dallas. uh wichita kansas those are some new dates. i just added so go. get tickets now atlanta georgia september. 9th washington dc i got a lot. of dates coming up. stockton california oakland california peoria. illinois rockford illinois raleigh north carolina. october 21st i'll be in savannah. which is where that guy. or that no the boy was. a woman that uh oh yeah. the woman that asked to. be interesting yeah uh denver. colorado november 5th cheyenne wyoming boston two. shows at the wang november. 12th lakeland florida that's. a new one in jacksonville. florida uh at the morin theater. on december 3rd and uh super cult. this is something that we didn't talk. about that's the new uh that's the new um uh stu. studios here and uh be ready. for some more content you know we got this podcast. we got congratulations on the uh this. new channel name too right. i didn't know what the new channel. name it's the new channel. name yeah yeah yeah um so uh subscribe. to us and there'll be more. content coming we've got other shows coming. up uh and if you have a question. sent in a video in the link. in the description below or go. to watchlifeline dot com. thank you very much thank you. on your ass [music].
