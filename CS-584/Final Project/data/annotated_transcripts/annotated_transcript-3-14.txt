the silly. putty you roll it on the newspaper and then all of a sudden it shows. what's on the newspaper couldn't do that. with regular printer paper printed out like my [ __ ] uh you know some some recovery [ __ ] i'm trying to. do it on that and it's not working. and it's also good to. have a bad dad. you know um but yeah denver was uh absolutely amazing. not too cold aided a place. called uh wow don't know the name. whoa dude what was the [ __ ] name of this goddamn place. man i need ginkgo franken biloba. anyway i ate this place. and they had the ozu. sandwiches dude i'm done with the ozios okay i'm done with the oju sandwiches i don't you know me dude. if you know me if you know. me and if you've listened to. every episode why don't i like our. juice because i want this [ __ ] to. be done when it comes. out if the juice belongs on the sandwich. put the juice on the sandwich. before you bring it to. me right it's not ketchup. it's not sauce they try. to act like it's sauce. dude it's like thinner than water. and so they give me the so they're like what do you. want so i get the turkey sandwich. with the [ __ ] there i got the thanksgiving. dinner sandwich which is like they're trying to. sandwich a fry everything and it's fine. but i say you know. what leave out the cranberry sauce because it [ __ ] up everything. in thanksgiving right doesn't it. because it's too sweet right. what's that dessert oh. i got stuffing and turkey and also uh potatoes and [ __ ] on my plate. and you're just gonna [ __ ] it all up with some sweet. [ __ ] dude really give it to. me later you might as well put a [ __ ] chocolate cake next to. my next to my dark. meat makes no sense dude. that's dessert it's not bad. it just doesn't go okay. so i got the the thanksgiving. dinner one i dipped it in the ozu. decided you know what i'm not an ozu. guy put it to. the side ate the sand. sandwich honestly ate the sandwich. dry as [ __ ] and that's how real i am. dude that's how [ __ ] real i am dude. and then they said i said can i have mayo. instead and they said oh do you i swear. to god they said do. you want cranberry mayo. and i say hey you're a cranberry pusher. man i want regular mayo. now that's a sauce right. so i like to. control how much of that. substance that belongs on my sandwich. but uh as you it's that's juice. that should already be in the shits. and we all know it. we all deep down know. it so i ate at this. place it was great that's three places. i've told you about don't know. the names of them. that's the place that i stayed at the other. sandwich place and then the donny guy from tick. tock that was a real man. i need to pay more. attention to life i need to. pay more attention to. people who come up to. me and say hi i need to. i need to pay more. attention to where i am and i need to. pay more attention to. where i'm going but isn't that. just everybody isn't that just everybody. right i'm waiting in line. and i'm at the [ __ ] coffee shop at the place that i stayed at and this guy turns over and he says hey man big fan i said oh thanks a lot i really appreciate it he said i didn't realize you look so badass whoopsie. daisy i'm yadded up dude. whoopsie daisy i'm all you added. up i didn't realize i was added. up i saw a picture of myself. and i'm [ __ ] yatted up. dude right i got one here i got one. here i got a tattoo every which way. you look at me i'm guided. the [ __ ] up unless you maybe you see me from behind i don't have any from behind but i'm getting them right. made me feel good you know. i don't know why every guy kind of wants. to be badass. it's silly right because we're not. we watch batman and [ __ ] the dark knight. whatever with uh the good. actor in it what's his name. uh robert pattinson got it and uh we're like that's probably how i would be the batman. that i would kind of be. but you wouldn't dude you just fall down. and slip and [ __ ] imagine you were batman. you'd [ __ ] die immediately. right but you watch it. and you're like dude see i you're watching this. [ __ ] and you're like see that's the kind of batman. i'd be i'd stick to. the shadows right not the other batmans. didn't really stick to. the shadows robert patton said batman. he stick to the shadows. so i get it i would kind of stick. to the shadows dude. how lost would you get as batman. that's me did denver then went to. cheyenne and uh did a trip. from denver to cheyenne. and let me tell you something. we got a sprinter van. and it was [ __ ] dope because you can get the sprinter vans that all had the seats. facing the same way and then you can also. get the [ __ ] elevated version where the seats. are facing each other. and you can have a real conversation. that jumps up the time. that you could have from nice. from goose to. silly goose dude this [ __ ] was awesome. when you're staring at each other. driving dude it took it out by the way. i didn't know cheyenne was an hour. away from denver also cheyenne. where is it also cheyenne. the capital of wyoming also not big. enough to be a capital. of anything cheyenne how many people do you have in it. 58 000 not enough how many people were at the show. one thousand that's 158th of the people. knew that chris delia was in town. that's absolutely insane dude i thought 1000. was a little bit small. of a show and then i realized your boy. 158th of the [ __ ] population there he's moving up too low. played for cheyenne and uh let me tell you something dude. that's a black stripper name and it's all. good right because it's the whitest place. in the world but it's a black stripper named cheyenne. but she just felt like she's the one. that found it hey y'all. we going we gonna post. out right here get your tents out. hey y'all look at this. [ __ ] [ __ ] man it's open if this place sure is open [ __ ] hey y'all get the chance bring them yaks over here [ __ ] look how open this is poster right here that's gonna be cheyenne i'm the mayor [ __ ] um so yeah and then now there's 58 000 people there and it is a place i did not know that cheyenne was a place where america the american government can fire nukes anywhere in the world in cheyenne wyoming also the reason is open space if the bomb goes off only 58 000 people die. and you know that's a lot. but it's not you know. it's not like you wouldn't launch nukes. from new york new york. start spreading the nukes um you wanna. be a part of it. nuke york nuke york so [ __ ] dumb i wanna. wake up in a city. that's permanently asleep [applause] um um so yeah we did cheyenne and a band of the ride. the ride was so elevated. in a in a time you know. in the not elevated it wasn't. actually physically elevated it was so elevated. the time was so elevated. because we were all looking. at each other and the tour. report dude we were doing. all sorts of jokes. the [ __ ] driver on the sprint sprinter van. we would get too loud. and he would [ __ ] put up the partition dude. that's the most disrespectful [ __ ] you can do that's so disrespectful to. be having such a good time. and then all of a sudden you notice that. partition like the driver's just like this. [ __ ] god damn it. and click some partition and the partition goes. up and he can't see us. uh but we were having a good. time and then got to. cheyenne uh you know thank you for coming. out cheyenne i didn't realize it was an hour. away from denver which means that if it was an hour. away from denver what could have happened. was all the people from cheyenne. could have went to. the denver show even though. they wouldn't have fit because it was almost sold. out but that's still you know um cheyenne. dude jeffree star came out to. see me uh which was very cool. tall tall drink of water um not

whatever now in ncis there. were three times i was watching an episode. of nine of ncis and i actually had the thought wait that. is scott bakula right. because he kind of looks like a guy that. looks like scott bakula now. and that's what happens. when you get older. a little bit and that's fine. but he did quantum leap. that's what he was really. famous for and then all of a sudden. he's on and say dude. imagine being a guy that. was had a a real career in the in the early. 90s and now it's 2. 000 and i think 15. or 14 is when it started ncis and they and they call you 30. years later and they're like hey scott bakula want. to be on the new ncis you. gotta feel like scott bakula must have. just been like uh oh i'm the luckiest. guy in the world like how could you not work. for 30 years and then all of a sudden just be given a franchise. i mean i know he worked and [ __ ] and i'm obviously but like this ncis dude they make ncis out of any city. and it becomes a [ __ ] smash hit from jump dude. ncis ncis los angeles which by the way. is still on that. started in like 2007. ncis is still on that. started in 2003 dude. it's been on for 20. years mark harmon last. year was like you
