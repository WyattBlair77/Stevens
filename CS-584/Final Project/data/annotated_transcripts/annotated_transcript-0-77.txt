the cd. on yeezy on yeezy dot com. and it's 2024 you can get the cd. what the hell would. you play it on at least sell the record. at least that's like some cool. memorabilia but the cd um but yeah. the oscars were pretty i didn't watch. them and and i i don't watch them. they're so corny and so bad but my favorite is. the um john cena thing how qanon believers. think john cena's oscar. bit was a public. initiation into the global. cabal hey cabal you know of got naked because uh he knew children. might be watching the the the the program. host jimmy kimmel and john. cena got big last for a bit. they did on oscars. were seen it was how about this dude. uh how about some how about how about some how about some body positivity. the guy's jacked looks phenomenal. super healthy he's probably 50. and looks you know 25. hey congratulations dude john cena how is this. in any way hurting any body. he got everything is covered. it's like he's wearing boxers and then also he looks great. you know what if fat ass. lizo was on there it wouldn't make a everyone would talk about how great it was right if fat ass lizo or or or some obese person was on there everyone would be saying yeah go you go america go body positivity. go amazing but because john cena a white. jacked guy is doing a funny bit. by the way john cena is just a lot you know i guess i but he's good he's good he's goodlook he's he's a good jacked. guy he obviously takes steroids. and that's fine even. though he says he doesn't but he does. and that's fine you know. i go back and forth. with this should you admit. you have steroids on. because he's also a hero. to a lot of kids. and if you say you do steroids. a lot of kids will get on steroids. so it's like maybe he shouldn't admit. he has on steroids now hug. jackman admit it when you were. doing wolverine or uh the rock. i don't know do kids. still like to rock. or is it more of a like a 35yearold. guy now to. to like the to. like the rock can you smell. what the rock is cooking. steroids that's what he's cooking. and uh but i love that. i love that the humiliation ritual. thing dude look at this. what it says no surprise. that john cena is walking on stage naked. at the oscars during prime. time tv that children. are most likely watching this. is not just a humiliation ritual. the hollywood pedophiles rapist and perverts are. certainly getting off on this. i'm sure jimmy kimmel is. as well dude wait a minute. how many does this. even what is daily dot dot com. ian too many dots in. it guys shredded huh got shredded god i need to. start snorting

home that's it. how's that for a sound. for tik tok but yeah i um i don't know. the oscars are always a joke. at least they got the guy who does late. night television to. do the monologues on the thing. like what what do you want. you get mad at joe koy you get mad. at uh uh people who aren't you aren't the guy. and then jimmy kimmel who is. the guy does it i don't know though. um but emma

[ __ ] bothers me because it's like i should have thought the older you get the dumber the more things you don't know you know you don't know you you you know so much [ __ ] when you're 15 i remember when i was 15 dude i was like i know so much [ __ ] and i know that they say teenagers know a lot of [ __ ] but i actually know a lot of [ __ ] and when i get older i need to. remember this feeling because i can't think of like those. old [ __ ] who get to. the point where like oh i thought i knew so much. when i was your age. and i'm still going to. know that [ __ ] even though they say that. i'm going to be i'm going. to be 35 i'm going. to be 45 i'm going. to be 55 and i'm still going. to be rocking my. knowledge dude as a i'm going. to be 15 but 55 and i'm still going. to be rocking that. knowledge and i'm going to. know i'm going to know. what i thought was a truth. dude i got to. be about 30some and i not only do i not know anything. i don't even know what i was. talking about i don't even i can't. even get you know when you're sick. and you can't feel what it. was like you you know. you're sick but you're like i can't. even feel what it feels. like to be not sick. that's how it is that's how dumb. i am that's how much i can't understand. any dude and i get dumber. and dumber dude i get so dumb. dude my wife will text. me something normal and hey dude i don't get it. i don't get it i don't get it. it's a simple sentence. and dude it's like i'm w. it's like i'm halfway through inception. like well i don't know where this. is going but i hope it. ends up making some kind of sense. that's how i am texting. in a group chat. my wife will text me. something simple i don't get it. period and i go my first thought is uhoh. oh no dude she's going to. think the way i respond. i'm going to try. and under h [ __ ] i got to. i got to ask her. what something means and she's going. to think i'm coming at it. like like a like a you know. like my wife's bag got stolen that's what it. was my wife bag. got stolen she went out and her bag. got stolen her [ __ ] nice bag. got stolen such pieces of [ __ ] to. steal a bag you know. she wanted to go out. blow off some steam have a good. time her bag got stolen she texted. me my bag got stolen trying. not to spin out lol. and i was like oh are you what's going. on like where did you. leave it somewhere or whatever. trying to help her. figure it out and she was like no. i'm just like you know. i didn't have anything important. in it one credit. card i stopped it i have my phone. obviously she's texting me. and i was like oh that's great. and then i was trying. to figure out information about. it in my head i'm like maybe i could help. and she's like why why didn't you ask. me if i'm okay and i'm like oh [ __ ] you text in and you texted lol should be all good but she's kind of right i should have been like are you okay because it is violating when somebody steals something from you but already it started so now immediately i'm confused now 15yearold me would have just been like ah she doesn't get it put the phone down i know life and then i would have just started listening to. [ __ ] daniel bingfield and just having a great. time but now i'm like oh [ __ ] i got to. figure out i don't want her. to well okay in therapy. they say this and so maybe if i just say i'm trying. to help let me try. to listen yes. i understand and then i'm using all this. dialogue and [ __ ] i'm using talking. boundaries hey with the talking. boundaries dude when i hear talking boundaries. it makes me wish i grew up. in the 30s talking boundaries. what are you a piece of [ __ ] what your feelings. you're a guy you stupid. idiot you know in the 30s. what do you mean. yeah you know what do. you mean it doesn't make you feel. good you're a guy you stupid.

or you don't did. i text it wait we got to. find this this is so funny. hold on was it. was it on lifeline chat. i gotta go back i'm going. back i'm finding it wow you send a lot. of [ __ ] huh you sent a lot of [ __ ] huh okay where is it oh here it is hell yeah dude this is unreal god damn it. why does it not. it doesn't do this thing. we're showing up no here. it is we are only capable of using 10% of our brain. right all right this. is a guy i don't know. who it is it's a guy. being interviewed about something and honestly. it doesn't matter anything. else besides that because it's just that's the setting if you're listening dud. you have to. listen to it this is. so [ __ ] hilarious to. me you believe that no yeah. that's yeah did you about. to say it's true. first of all do you believe that. is amazing we only use 10% of our brain. do you believe that like testing. the waters i'm saying that's what people say. that that is that is the consensus scientifically. scientifically so who was the guy. that used 11 that made it. o okay to say. everybody just us already off. the rails dude made it okay. who was the guy that. used 11 to made it okay. to say that it was okay. to that isn't the right. logic honestly i'm going to. say she's right and she's smart. for saying that but she is hon. to me bro. that i if somebody said that. to me i couldn't say anything. but what do you mean. like she makes a leap like knowing about his dumb. logic and gets to the point where she can understand. what he's trying to. say and that makes me think she might be dumb. herself cuz how do you do that how did she just [ __ ] how did she uh figure out her way into. what this idiot is might mean. she killed it maybe she's smarter. than me because of that person who uses 10%. of your brain is the one. that's no because if you're only using 10%. of your brain you don't even know that. you're using 10% of your brain. no hey put it plainly. no like she knew it. was your brain based on i thought he [ __ ] had her and who's he your brain you don't have to. be using oh doubl down who's he to. know some else 10 he's saying. i'm 10% you're 10 like everyone's 10% that is not mathematically correct. that is math like someone had but you have to. have been using 10% of your brain. to know that everyone else uses. t yes because if you're only using 10% or something that mean. you don't know the rest of the 90. that's the that is the part. where i go oh somebody. hit the red button somebody hit the red. button take us out of our misery. you don't know yeah you're right. so i'm right perfect no no no you're right. about the 90 and the 10. okay so if i'm only using 10. right i'm the first person in the world. right say i'm adam and just so many jumps. dude so i'm take this. i'm the first person in the world. i'm adam just a [ __ ] dun this is unreal. dude i wrote that we can only use 10% of wrote you. know wrote adam wrote nothing. brains that means brains 10% of our. [laughter] brains i would have to. surpass the number 10 no. okay let me break this. down for you you can break. it down say i'm i'm a doctor he spins. in his chair says you. can break it down you're own. dude that is unreal. bro the confidence dude. the confidence is amazing. let me put it i want. to play it again. because it's so funny dude. um here i'm going to. play it on my computer. it's a little better that. way and i can st. and start it dude. this is so funny to. me we are only capable of using 10% of our brain. already dude it looks like he already. knows he's [ __ ] dog [ __ ] in the argument 10% at that. moment right right yes you believe that no it's an idiot dude. the sky is blue. you believe that yeah that's yeah. did you about to. say it's true i mean. okay so it's true. guy you know i'm saying that's what people. say that that is that is the consens sci consens scientifically. just repeating what she said you. know so who was the he's like the david. allen greer uh character. inan living color guy that used 11. that dude this is like the [ __ ] scene from uh it it goes up. to 11 what's the spinal. tap dude but this one's louder because it goes up to. 11 made it o okay to. say everybody just using 10. that isn't the right. logic the same person who uses 10% of your brain is the one that said 10% no because if you're only using 10% of your brain you don't even know that you're using 10% of your brain like like it was to. what is the logic there. if you use 10% of your brain. how do you know. you're only using 10% of your brain. this you know what the problem. is with this guy it's not that. this guy doesn't think he's dumb. it's that he thinks he's smart. you know what i'm talking. about 15yearold me right. there and and honestly that guy's going. to go so far in life. i'll tell you right now. that guy's going to. live to be 105 he's going. to oh dude. this is the goal. actually this woman's going to. die a can answer at. like 65 and this. dude's going to live. to be 100 because of his you got to. be like this [ __ ] dude but he'll have no family. though you know bra based on your brain. you don't have to. be using 11% to. know someone else 10 he's saying. i'm 10% you're 10 like everyone's 10% that is not mathematically correct. that is mathematic like someone had to. but you have to. have been using 10. more than 10% of your brain. to know that everyone else uses. to yes because if you're only using 10%. of something that mean. you don't know the rest of the 90. what does that mean. dude so you don't know the rest of the 0. and in the rest of the 90. is how you would know. that you're using 10% of the brain. or something you don't know. yeah you're right so i'm right. perfect no no no you're right. about the 90 and the 10. okay so if i'm only using 10. right i'm the first first person. in the world right say. i'm adam and i wrote that. we can only use 10% of our brains. that means i would have to. surpass the number 10 why. does it mean [music]. that that's crazy let me break this. down for you you break. it down say i'm a doctor i love it. dude i wish i could see the whole interview. and invite that guy over. and then honestly have a really great. [ __ ] time and have him be one of my friends and my mom would be mad um what a crazy leap. dude oh this was great. right here right here the guy can't. help it [ __ ] perv the guy cannot help. but perv who who is this. uh woman i don't even. know but he he he's taken pictures. of her and she turns around. and her and her butt. is big and the the bro. the guy can't help it. he let his perve slip. out and then one more time. looking right here god this. is so annoying when they're doing this. i i used to. do this [ __ ] over here over here over here and they're like over here mr and then someone else is always in the back. who's this guy i got to. i got to put it on my hold. out those arms and then please the front of the outfit. front of the outfit that's getting over. the shoulder yeah she turns says ohly smokes dude. such a white guy. so pervin dude let his perv. slip out you know oh my god dude. oh my god it's that's i got to. start i have to. actually start jerking off. i'm sorry guys hold this. camera oh god all right. let's see the front of the outfit. all right let's move on. who we got now rdj. good thing i've busted a nut. all right what do we got here. all right who we got oh okay. we got uh we got uh the the guy. that chryst leia can never remember his. name from green mile. and galactic galaxy quest again. i can't remember his name. steve wait don't tell me. remember i i can't remember his [ __ ] name dude for the life of me. hold on a second hold on. a second sam rockwell yes i'm getting better. dude i'm getting better man. you know how i but it's unfair. because i just go i remember his name. is my dog's name and then i get sam. and then rockwell dude that's [ __ ] why can't i just remember his name is sam rockwell that took me like minutes. on one episode oh the state of the union. happened which i know. i know not to. i come to this. same chamber to address. nation now it's we who face. unprecedented moment in the history of the union right. and yes my purpose tonight is to. wake up the congress and alert. the american people that this is no ordinary. moment either so drunk dude. since president lincoln and the civil war president. lincoln president have freedom and democracy. not since president lincoln you not since president. lining democracy war assault at home. as they are today s today. drun took [ __ ] so many shots beforehand all right. we doing this democracy. war this president president not say. president clinton it's president lincoln makes our moment. rare is a freedom of democracy. are under attack at both. at home and overseas at the very same time. overseas putin of russia is on the march invading ukraine it's actually i don't think i could even do this i guess i kind of do stand up and stuff but it's crazy bro that i can't believe we're here with trump and biden oh now we're going to. get now we can't now we're going. to be demonetized great. or whatever dude i got to. stop talking about the election. like i don't i'm so dumb. anyway here we go god. it got hot in here i had to. put the air on for a little bit jordan and have a great. day and keep being undeniably. you go to my page. if you want to. purchase a 10word out shout out or add holler. christalia. there you go jordan with a y. people who try to. spell their name a little differently. i don't know about that. huh hey my name is dave. how do you spell it. p a u l. um uh all right that's it. um thank you very much. you guys that was episode. 369 go on over that's our that's it. for the uh patreon that's it. for the youtube episode if you want to. go watch the rest of it. go to our patreon patreon. dot com christas sign. up and uh for six bucks. you get uh all the full. episodes and then also uh all of the extra episodes. of month uh and we really appreciate you. if you that you keep the show. going without you guys this. show would not keep going so uh thank you. very much until next [music]. timeck than you [music] you.
