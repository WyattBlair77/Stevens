[ __ ] oscar because he's pretty okay kind of handsome. if he was brad pitt level just i like he wouldn't even. got nominated he would have got snubbed city. dude snub city for [ __ ] colin firth drinking coffee for those watching for those listening smoking a bong so anyway dude i know about my bang [ __ ] i know about bong um i know about bong uh yeah so who else puts that [ __ ] right and then my girl was like you know who [ __ ] breaks this you know who shatters the stereotype that hot. guys can't ask and i said. who and she was like tom [ __ ] hardy and i was like he's he's a damn good actor and he's pretty [ __ ] sexy but i have a feeling tom hardy is five nine just gonna put that out there don't know how tall he is um also there's the level of acting that christian. bale can do daniel de lulu. can do [ __ ] robert de niro. can do al pacichi these guys. all do it and [ __ ] kill it al pacino. could oh dude if he was in king's speech. they would give him two oscars. oh riiii oiiiii they make good. choices dude de niro. makes good choices these guys. are good you know who you know. who [ __ ] ripped and let me just actually tell you right now i had no idea this guy was a good actor as a matter of fact before this movie that i saw which was [ __ ] terrible and i could say that now i could talk about what movies are bad. and what movies are good. now because i'll never be in any movies. but um this guy was so good in this. movie i thought he was a bad. actor because he was handsome. but this guy was the only good thing. about this movie is it. [ __ ] king kong vs godzilla or godzilla vs king kong i don't know what it. was called there was an old one. called one of the ways. and then the new one. is called the other way. i think this one's called godzilla. versus king kong and the one in like the 40s. was king kong vs godzilla i don't know. why they didn't just [ __ ] why. did you change it you. know the sars guard guy. i don't know what his first. name is because i think there's another actor that's last name. is tsar's guard sarsguard must be. like the dutch smith or whatever. the [ __ ] swedish smith it's got two a's and a [ __ ] k in it a 2k it's weird it's a weird last name skarsgard and um that guy is so good in the hong kong movie because he is so he i didn't know he could do character. [ __ ] it was like tom cruise when he played the [ __ ] guy in uh tropical thunder i almost said jungle fever um and uh tropical thunder uh uh when tom cruise came in and did the dancing it was the fat bald guy but what's his name [ __ ] skarsgard is it peter alexander dude alexander skarsgard too many syllables hello syllables for sale alexander skarsgard was like i'll have 12. and uh and he did a character. acting in that movie and he was so good now. let me tell you another. thing that movie made no sense. i thought when i was watching a movie i was like oh i'm a dumb. [ __ ] idiot i can't understand king kong or godzilla versus king kong or if i was japanese. i call it godzilla which is weird. how sometimes japanese guys say sneak. in english words but kind of make it a little japanese. [ __ ] oh godzilla well actually godzilla is japanese. so whatever the [ __ ] but you know what i mean and um he's in that movie. and he's good and that movie. has 900 leads why is everybody. in that movie a main character. dude so many people in that main character. in that movie oops got a tumor so many people in that movie are leads in are the lead. they've got [ __ ] so many people in that movie by the way dude first of all let me go back to. this i thought the movie was not going to. make any i i thought it was dumb. i was like this is am. i a dumb oh. i'm a dumb [ __ ]. idiot you ever watch a movie. like okay i'm a dumb [ __ ]. here this is king kong i should get it. this is godzilla versus king kong i should get it. watch the movie all of a sudden i feel like okay. i'm a dumb and then i text. my friends during the [ __ ] godzilla versus king kong am i a dumb. [ __ ] idiot and my friend said no don't worry that movie [ __ ] makes no sense and i was like really then i was like what's this robot godzilla and he texts back. i don't know and i said well who's the scientist. that created it and why did he do that. and he wrote dot dot dot to. destroy the world and i wrote why and he said i don't know they don't give a [ __ ] these hollywood guys i thought that they make movies i i'm not sure if they i'm not sure what's worse and i'm not sure if you don't give a [ __ ] about i think i have what's worse okay so there's two things you can do here you can create the there's a first of all there's a part in the movie where godzilla is dying and they need to. revive him and this alexander skarsgard guy is like i got it i got the idea and i'm as a watcher i'm like whoa he's got the idea how the [ __ ] are they gonna revive king kong he's like i'll fly my plane park it on his chest and we'll explode. it and then his heart will start beating again. and i go but that doesn't make sense. and he did it and it happened. and it worked and then there's another part. where godzilla's in the middle. of the world in the middle. of the earth all upside down. and also right side. up and [ __ ] and he has to. get back to tokyo what am. i even saying this is actually. what happens in the movie. though and he has to. get back to tokyo so godzilla breathes a [ __ ] hole. from tokyo to. the center of the earth. and then [ __ ] king kong floats through. it and then kills him. with an axe that happened to. be in the middle of the earth. ah that's real that's a real movie ah dude. what i want to. know is here's the thing if the people with the franchise. are like who gives a [ __ ] dude. we're just gonna put out this. [ __ ] it's gonna be worldwide people in japan. and asia they don't give a [ __ ] as long as there's fighting. with big monsters and they say well. what about like people in america. and they say america's a fraction of what. we're going to make and they'll just watch it. anyway and you too because it's king kong i respect. that get those bags. [ __ ] get those [ __ ] ass bags. okay but i have a feeling. that it wasn't that i have a feeling. that it was oh i got it. just like alexander skarsgard in that movie. the exec was like i got it. he'll fly the plane. on the chest and then put it on king kong's chest. explode it and then king kong's heart. will start beating again. and then like the other guys. are like oh yeah but there's got to. be one or two me's in there. that are like hey but yo about the sense. about it and then they say it's a [ __ ] big lizard and an ape who gives a [ __ ] it was such a bad [ __ ] movie and the thing about that movie was the only people in that movie were people that um that people that nobody saw that people like didn't understand like you've seen them before but we're like like who jean renau was in 1990 where you were just like who's that [ __ ] person oh she's from what the lead in it the [ __ ] alexander skarsgard who i didn't even know his name until right now the guy he's to. me is the guy from true. blood which i never saw that. and then there was also the [ __ ] guy who was the only person i do know their name is [ __ ] millie bob thornton and [ __ ] uh the [ __ ] her name milly bob thornton millie millie bobby brown millie teddy pendergrass why is her [ __ ] last name bobby brown isn't that a [ __ ] millie people bryson [laughter] dude millie peebo bryson dude wow how much does people bryson get [ __ ] paid. 50 grand to come to. somebody's birthday party and sing dude hey what's happening guys hi. i'm people bryson happy birthday. to you happy birthday. to you it's a happy. happy birthday to. people bryson he still says his name. even though it's [ __ ] mary's birthday. doesn't give a [ __ ] and then he goes happy. birthday to you and he goes. and [ __ ] s and puts out all the candles with himself. and he goes good day. where's my check and um milly pop. pop milly bob milly bobby brown. was in it and uh she was in it. and that was she's a good actress. but why was she in it. and then someone and then the [ __ ] guy who plays her. dad is the [ __ ] guy from that show. the daily news and also the king kong guy um in the other king kong movie. it's so confusing dude. and he is a good actor and he was in blood what. the [ __ ] that movie on show on netflix. blood not blood sport blood in bloodline. bloodline who's that guy they're all the guys that. are [ __ ] in other movies where you're like oh yeah oh and the girl from the [ __ ] town is the lead who i don't know her name put [ __ ] tom cruise in it dude god damn it put [ __ ] harrison ford in it dude if i'm watching king kong movie with godzilla put goddamn matthew mcconaughey in it dude like that movie reign of fire with matthew. mcconaughey and christian bale where they fight. dragons that's the ticket dude. matthew mcconaughey and christian. bale that's the [ __ ] ticket dude. they got uh dragons. and [ __ ] in it i want to. see those [ __ ] swimming swords and axes. and one guy lives underground. and one guy lives overground and one guy's in the faction. and runs it and then that guy. needs the guy underground. to help because he's got the [ __ ] pull with the people even though the guy above ground is more. strong and more of a hunter. you know what i'm talking. about i wrote it dude. i wrote that right there. i just wrote that right. there dude i could have never wrote as as dumb. as that movie was i could. have never wrote it. the king kong godzilla thing how do you write. [ __ ] like that honestly like and i don't even mean the the logistics of it. which don't make sense. how do you write. and then the huge ass big. robot godzilla comes to. life like that's what happened. and he unplugs himself. and now dot dot dot he's got a mind. of his own and that's in bold. in the script and you're supposed. to be like whoa with one. fell swoop he breathes fire into his creator the student. has killed the teacher. you know what i mean. this is what they say. and then [ __ ] guy who was cast because of because of politics. his line god damn um it's just like dude. come on man and there's the movies. like that and then there's movies like nomad. land is that the movie with francis. mcdormand oh yeah cool oh i'll watch. that yeah i'll watch what's it. about oh it's about a lady. and that's it all right. yeah dude sign me the [ __ ] up dude. one nine dollar ticket. for nomad land what's it. about a lady roaming around. well dude why didn't you say. let me wait in line. for it before the movie. theater even even opens up like they do. for star wars and let me dress. as francis mcdormand's character. because that's amazing dude. oh it's about a [ __ ] lay dude. hey the movie's about some lady. that's what it's about. some lady that's looking for some [ __ ] but really what she's looking. for is some [ __ ] inside her right. i didn't read about it. but right isn't that what it's about. she [ __ ] probably is in a tent. for way too long in one. of the acts or some trailer. why are they making that. dude cause you [ __ ] get tricked. and you watch your [ __ ] and you see her and she does the i like king speech style. acting and you're like god damn. francis mcdormand is good and she is good she's a great.
