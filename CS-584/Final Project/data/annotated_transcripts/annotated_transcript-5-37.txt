leonard. by the way i didn't know here's how much of personality. matters in basketball i didn't know who he was and apparently he's a superstar player but like guys like lebron you know and and and even other guys steph. curry they developed a personality. what's his name kelly. what car we leonard kauai. hawaii the [ __ ] vip. lay this hawaii leonard laughs i'm gonna play. this laugh for you if you don't know. about it but jesus. christ it sounds like the most insecure. jayz of all time yourself and what would you. like people to know. about you there we go. listen i'm a fun guy. oh really obviously i love the game. of basketball i'm a fun. guy i mean there's just more question. you have to. ask me in order for me. to tell you about myself. look let me tell you something. first of all before we get into. the insecure laugh this. guy plays basketball i respect this guy he doesn't give a [ __ ] about the [ __ ] he doesn't have necessarily an outgoing crazy [ __ ] superstar personality but whatever he doesn't need to. he's all about the basketball. apparently is one of the best. in the game props to. this [ __ ] guy props this guy also for doing this they were probably like get out there and do the thing they're like what do you want people to. know about you and he says i'm a fungi i'm a fungi every note is. the same if you're talking and every note is the same. dude talking is musical you know. what i mean when i'm talking i go. up i say oh this. kind of [ __ ] and i go lay down they say hey man nana oh really all i'm doing is hypnotizing you right. you learned how to. say certain stuff as a comedian. you think about that all the time. you go to it. you talk about this. mana and then pahahahah everyone. laughs this guy's just like i'm a fun. guy of course it's not gonna work. you're not going to. get people on your side. personalitywise now here is the rest of the this. can't give you a whole. spiel oh my in order. for me to tell you. about myself i just can't give you a whole. spiel oh so robot just in order. for me to tell you. about myself i just can't give you a full spiel. unless you ask specific questions. i don't even know where you. said natalie i mean. there's just more question you have to. ask me in order for me. to tell you about myself. i just can't give you a whole. spiel i don't even know where you. said natalie [laughter]. in order were you sitting there. i just don't even know. where you sitting at that. was the best part that was a part. where you realize oh wash my hands. of this do you know. what i mean he was just like you know. in order to tell you what. i'm like you gotta get more specific i just can't. give you a full spill. i don't even know where you're sitting. at hey hey man. you're a robot listen that whole thing. again how robotic it. is how crazy is it. to have a personality but that's what they said. about steph curry in the beginning. and that dude lit it. up yourself and what would you like people. to know about you first. of all speaking of the mic. i'm a fun guy obviously i love the game. of basketball i mean. there's just more question you have to. ask in order for me. to tell you about myself. you just can't give you a whole. spiel i don't even know where you. sit in comments laughter i mean. dude you got to. see the video you got to. see his mouth do it it's weird. as [ __ ] it looks like a simpson all of a sudden he looks like what he looks like when that guy at [ __ ] at the the drunk. in the simpsons burps that. when it goes and all the [ __ ] sir and secure. hey man easy just say. man you know what you know. what it is this. guy's probably i mean he's how old is he like 24. maybe that's the thing man. when i was 22. i remember being at before i did. standup and before i became a [ __ ] thick skinned. individual because of bombing for so much. i got construction in the house. sorry if you hear it. [ __ ] whatever disrespectful but the he's 27. years old when i was 22. i remember i broke up. with a girl a girl broke up. with me broken my heart and then i was like you know. what i am gonna go. out i'm gonna go my but it's like come on come. out let's go let's go hang out we'll get you you talk to. some chicks you know we'll get you out.

and i didn't know anybody there. and there was a really cute. girl there and i thought you look like britney. spears and this back when britney spears was. like the [ __ ] hottest you know the number one [ __ ] to. me the archetype of like oh my god how does she give her. so so i was like she was in our conversation. i was like what do. i say to. this girl in my head i was like what. do i do how do i talk and then i would say things. and every time i said something. i was like how come these [ __ ] words are coming. out of my mouth i don't want to. sound like this but everything. single time she said something. she be like oh well what. else did this and that. and i'd be like basically it's weird. i was 22 then i got a stage started bombing. a lot and then didn't give a [ __ ] about anything that laughs literally sounds more. like busting and not than laughing. it actually does unbelievable. whole spiel i don't even. know where he said natalie. god damn i want to. hang out with that guy. make him laugh all day. long so funny did you see. the cavanaugh thing that matt damon. did the [ __ ] hardest laugh is when he came out and they were like mr. cavanaugh and he just goes

[ __ ] go to japan. and be and and work with this. company called tiger shoes that that made track shoes and he wanted to. [ __ ] sell him he wanted to. be the american he wanted. to sell him in the american. market and this company kept [ __ ] him over and [ __ ] him over and he kept on you know doing better and better business every year until it was like in 1980 he made like a hundred and forty million dollars for the company but it was like or 79 i think but it's like the amount of [ __ ] the guy here's the two things that stick with me in this book dude first of all you gotta [ __ ] love what you do otherwise you're just not going to. make it unless you have supreme luck. on your side which nobody does. so you gotta love what you do. you gotta want to. do it like i was just telling a story to. a [ __ ] buddy of mine i love standup so much you can't get me offstage you can't get me offstage i'll go on stage every [ __ ] night you can't [ __ ] tell me not to. i will wait till i get my money. if i can't tell me nothing. oh in senate no no. no whatever but i'll go on. stage all the time you can't. tell me nothing and i mean. nothing this guy was gonna make shoes. you can't tell him nothing. dude he was gonna make shoes. no matter what and he thought about it. obsessed about it he got the shipment. from tiger in japan and he [ __ ] had his office in his mom's house. in his basement got all the shoes. and rolled around in him. smelled them looked at him. and [ __ ] rolled around in his shoes. crazy passionate yeah yeah but [ __ ] successful down the road. that's what happens my buddy. this was the story i was gonna tell you my buddy. who i'm not friends. with anymore cuz turned out. to be bass [ __ ] we were both you know audition i hate auditioning this. guy loved auditioning he was like dude. every it's my time it's my time. of the week to. act sometimes i only have two auditions one audition a week. but that's my time so i rehearsed he loved going. on what the material was. he'd break it down and go in and that was his moment whether he's in there for five minutes or twenty. five minutes that was his moment. of the week to. shine and he loved it. and he booked stuff and i didn't and once. i got on stage. as a comedian i understood i'm the comedian. bro i'm gonna be successful. as comedian because that's what i do. i love it i happen. to have some sort of a talent. for it and i [ __ ] between those two things with a little bit of luck. you [ __ ] get it go in my babies. you get a [ __ ] going make your [ __ ] hobby your job. then you'll never be upset. well you won't never be upset. but you'll be happy with what. you do for your [ __ ] for a living you know it's like i'm trying. to tell these [ __ ] dude this guy loves tasted. i screamed he ate it. he made his hobby his [ __ ] job. mmhmm that pop nope he made. it his job to. taste ice cream i'm sure. that was a [ __ ] hard road. was it or was he just a [ __ ] fat guy that put on a lab. coat who knows that could be the little bit. of luck but you got to. [ __ ] work hard that's a 10 he came up with a catchphrase for [ __ ] sake dude now that's a 10 now that's a 10 killing. it babies make your hobby. your job you never work. a day in your life. that's the saying right just you know. it's incredible man but anyway it's a good. book i can't okay so the two things. that stuck with me or how passionate it. was about what he did. and how [ __ ] many obstacles and hurdles you have to. [ __ ] get over it was unbelievable. dude every other page. is like and then this happened. and i'm getting mad reading. this [ __ ] book oh mike this guy just wants to. make a [ __ ] shoe dude he just wants to. get [ __ ] he literally wanted runners to. run faster and he wanted to. get shoes i mean maybe he's if what he called. it psychopath i don't know but all he wanted. to do was [ __ ] make people run. faster in sell shoes that's all. he wanted to do. he wanted to better the shoes. if the shoes were bad he would recall him. and make him better and take a hit from the company. but that's all he wanted. to [ __ ] do and the government literally the american. government was trying to. stop him threat of free. enterprise my babies but they were trying. to stop him but do i know.
