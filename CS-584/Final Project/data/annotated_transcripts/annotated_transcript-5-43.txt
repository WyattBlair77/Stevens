the mets and the dodgers. jeff kent anyway he looked like a [ __ ] he was this baseball player that was this action that looks literally couldn't look more if you think of action movie star in the 80s. couldn't look more like jeff. kent the ball player on. [ __ ] new york mets toronto. blue jays cleveland indians san francisco giants houston astros. los angeles dodgers he's been on all those teams. okay and we would see him. and you know like you know. like the if you've ever been to. a baseball game when the batting when the batter plays they'll put up his like [ __ ] picture on the on the on the big jumbotron thing and it'll be like and it'd be like number 45 jeff kent and then it would show his picture and then like by the way that song make a better. song hey i've got a word for you. guy who scores the batters. when they're brick when they're brought up. [ __ ]  at bat i've got a word for you try literally just took the [ __ ] a board and just went and then one guy and then they woke one guy up oh wait that's a song that is that that's the beginning of at the carwash song it is no way we got to. [ __ ] try this this is what wan fire. says which is why we [ __ ] have him one higher. this is that's the beginning. of a [ __ ] real actual song i thought they were just well then why the [ __ ] didn't they pay to. me at the car wash she's saying well we got to. play this at the i know that. song obviously gosh what video dude. this is what they play. every time a dodger gets up. by every ever though every other time they have a few at the carwash. here we go car wash. movie clip oh yeah know what that was a [ __ ] movie there's got to. be it i mean dude. at the car wash video there's so many [ __ ] up videos that come up. it's like i drove my car. to the carwash i'm gonna [ __ ] about that. rose royce a rose royce dude for [ __ ] sake this goddamn ad video will play after ad it's the worst yeah so anyway they will play this song and jeff kent whoever would be batting would be [ __ ] them up in it wow dude this is a real song and have way too many and like get a strike in a foul ball and then a [ __ ] a few balls dude it's kind of disrespectful that they [ __ ] didn't name ball they just called it a ball like a strike is a strike and then if you if it's outside of it it's called a ball right that's like come up dude what you're just calling it the thing that you throw bro baseball hey baseball try harder dude you know how much downtime there is for a baseball player they could literally just be like checking their email and drinking a [ __ ] chocolate shake literally in the field or in the dugout do they have a place to. hang out during the game. how [ __ ] hey baseball players try at least do jumping jacks. when you're not at bat like dude. they're just [ __ ] they got their knee up just eating they eat they eat during the game. they have [ __ ] chew. theirs and then in bubble gum. they eat sunflower seeds. dude if you're playing a sport. where you can eat hey give up. play basketball i mean dude. hey oh yeah oh cool. oh it's our turn at bat. oh cool oh nice how am i gonna. beat up this inning. no probably not there's nine of us. okay alright well then i guess you guys. just go up and i'll take a break. by the way i my [ __ ] right field and never do anything yeah balls get hit out to. me sometimes oh oh and baseball is the only sport. where you can have a [ __ ] fat outofshape. guy football they're fat but they're in shape. bro but baseball you take too many. breaks dude oh hey how about this. i'm the designated hitter i. do as much activity physically. as your mom ah oh hey yeah i'll get up. oh dude yeah i'm off i got a fat gut. and i eat during this. sporting event that i'm a part. of i eat i eat and chill. oh you want me. to bat cool hope i hit a home. run otherwise i've got a run. unbelievable dude that's actually unbelievable. and then baseball is so lazy. that they call the thing. that's not a strike a ball. which is just the thing that you throw now. up to the plate. hensley mule ends we didn't come. up with a song we just got the most basic. song and then we'll end it. before the good part that's it. that's what you hear. at least play this [ __ ] part see it's too far. it's too funky that's why. it's too funky player. it's too much you know. what you know what they think it. is they think because it's america's. pastime they think it's disrespectful. that's what they do but in actuality it's disrespectful. to just play the [ __ ] clap part. of the thing dude. i mean you know what you know. what they should do you know. what they should do all. the guys who don't hit that. inning that are just taking a break and the designated. hitter and maybe the guy who plays left. field why don't you guys get together. when the other guys are [ __ ] having to. hit and you guys come up. with a jingle come up. with a [ __ ] jingle so when jeff kent is that bat i'm not falling asleep. with the worse beginning. of any song of all time. dude they should have it. you know what they should have they should have. this song this is the song. this is the song. that should [ __ ] come up when you now batting what come on now batting number 25 [music] darryl strawberry okay you know that song hey write more lyrics i'm a sick [ __ ] i like it sick [ __ ] quick [ __ ] dude kanye couldn't look more like he [ __ ] himself that whole. video by the way he's was like this. there's probably a toilet. in that [ __ ] thing it's so big yeah dude baseball try by the way baseball is my favorite sport. i'm making a joke but baseball's favorite. sport you know why cuz there's breaks that's why. stop i do feel like try also but also dude. relax you're in your 30s. relax you know like basketball and [ __ ] like that's why i didn't like sport. it's like you want the ball. that bad [ __ ] take it dude. i got [ __ ] to. do i got a look at emails. here here you want the ball so bad. here you know i'm we're not what we in the nba. i guess if you're in the nba. it's a different story getting paid.

[ __ ] thinks that this is the real kurt russell now that's where you're gonna have to. get a hey all right. so he so i'm like wow so i i log out. i'm like that's amazing i tell him. my friends like this. is [ __ ] amazing and i'm laughs and we're all laughing but then it starts. to dawn on me. all of the things all of the all. of the things that actors and struggling artists. that move to. hollywood have to. sacrifice and give up they ruin. relationships they lose money. they they're they're broke they're starving. right they leave their [ __ ] big fish in a small small town and they [ __ ] come out to. hollywood to try and make it. and they're eating ramen and toast every meal. and they give up everything. just to hope to. maybe get an audition for some [ __ ] kohl's commercial. you know i'm talking about calls so i start. getting annoyed at the internet. and i start getting annoyed. at at at people and this you know. culture that we have where they just want everything handed. to them this is the beginning. of it this is before. the [ __ ] kardashians had a career this is before people were just paying for fit t you know what i'm talking about now. this guy i'm getting mad at this. guy cuz if this guy oh i'm a huge fan. always want to. be an actor if there's anything i can do if there's anything you could do move to. [ __ ] la drop everything and try you're not trying you're the baseball of sports. right you're not trying you're taking breaks. you got the seventhinning stretch you [ __ ] so move to. la digit so i think you know what this. is actually [ __ ] that this guy's doing this. so i write back as quoteunquote kurt. russell and i write wow. man i'm humbled thanks a lot. it's awesome that you're a huge fan. i actually never write back but you seem like it. got a good look and you know. if you really want to. audition for my next movie. about race cars i say. what you can do is you can. put a monologue on tape. and why don't you do the scene. from a few good men. where jack nicholson says you. can't handle the truth. and and put it on tape. and do your best and send it. over to me in a link. and i'll watch it. and if it's good i'll cast you in my next. movie about race cars. alright now here's the thing where i judge i'm not a bad. guy for doing this because this guy oh i already. explained how everyone gives up. everything on [ __ ] you know to. try and move out. here to be a just get a glimpse. of what the [ __ ] they want. for the dream right now. i think if this guy actually thinks i'm serious. and is actually kurt russell hey man. you want to. audition for my racecar movie put on a [ __ ] monologue from a few good men and he does it then guess what his fault okay so i send it and i wait a few days i check it and when i check it there's the [ __ ] audition that this braindead italian [ __ ] is sends me audition of him doing the scene from a few good men okay in his italian accent now this is the thing first of all i'm watching it crying laughing rolling around on my on my apartment floor rolling around crying laughing watching this guy doing a few good men in his italian accent okay now in my memory now this was 12 years ago. but in my memory the the dude. had and i'm i'm 95% sure was wearing sunglasses okay and i first said that. was putting sunglasses then i realize it's because the [ __ ] audacity he's off screen he's reading the monologue. okay so the disrespect that. this [ __ ] guy has to. just try and get a job in hollywood. by hitting up kurt russell on my space. and then adhering to. doing the monologue or saying he'll. do the monologue and then [ __ ] reading it offscreen trying to.
