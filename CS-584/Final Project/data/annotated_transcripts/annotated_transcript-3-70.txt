[ __ ] look buff. look at do it at a bodybuilding. show look at how i look at it. so [ __ ] but it's a triceratops skull and it's gr and i love it and uh that's their best tattoo that. you think so i mean certainly in terms of like i think he's like the artistry. he's [ __ ] good yeah he's really really great. devin menna at uh what's it. called um uh some vatican vatican studios in irvine. and it's uh and it's great. and i love it and it's peeling. so when it gets regular and then the [ __ ] hair grows back in you could imagine how [ __ ] crazy good i'll look right now because i always need it on the other side right because i had the [ __ ] over here like this and now i have the [ __ ] over here like this and when i'm like this dude now i look like a full [ __ ] tattered dude i'm going to. be tied up you are. a dude you think i'm a tatted. dude would you say i'm like a tied it. up dude you have a tattoo on your neck. and all over your arms and on your chest. how many tattoos do you think it. takes to be a tattoo one. dude two three four five five i have six i don't like that you're acting like you don't know how many tattoos you have i don't okay well then that's the mark of the chatted dog. yeah fair enough fair enough. yes if you don't know how many you have i'm sexy. dude don't that's what you're saying. don't i don't like when people act like they're not flexing. they're just doing a normal. thing but they're actually flexible but i was i wasn't yeah. yeah but i'm i'm not pretending like i'm not flexing. i am flexing and i know. it and everyone knows that. and that's why i know. it um so i got this tattoo and it's great. and it's flaking and can you imagine when it. looks not flaking and the hair pops back. in like how good i'm gonna look i can completely. imagine that now on the other hand. now on the other hand. who the [ __ ] grows hair. on the inside of their. arms well no but here's the thing. because they shave it a little bit yeah. and there's no hair there but there's no hair. there because they [ __ ] shave it in general i know but you see how there's hair over here. oh a little baby. so there'll be a little hair. over here and it'll cover it. up nicely a little bit. and it'll look like i've had it. for a while because also it's very dark. because i just got it. it needs to fade a little bit. so it looks like you know. so i look like i've been through. some [ __ ] because right now it looks like i'm just like a fresh tatted up. dude and you don't want to. look like a fresh tatted. up dude that's kind of because it's like oh you just got that. people like you just got that. dude i was walking around. this for for two weeks. i couldn't do anything people like oh you just got that. and it made me feel like [ __ ] just gotten things i mean i don't know it makes me i don't want people to. i i don't want to. like talk about it like if you're like oh when'd you get that. oh yeah i got a long. time ago that's cool. but if it's like oh you just got that. yeah where oh i got it. at this place oh yeah he did my brother. or i know about him. from instagram and then i gotta [ __ ] sit there and i'm just like actually just let me get three shots of coffee. you should prepare for that. if you're gonna get a tattoo a big one on your [ __ ] neck you know what i saw i saw a lady today today as i was getting these [ __ ] three shots over over ice. i only got three because i went to. get four and the lady. said uh okay let me get four. shots i said let me. get four shots of espresso. and she said okay and she was doing. it and then she was like wait hold. on and i'm already like okay. and she was like hold. on wait i can't okay. all right now i have it. go through and then i put the credit card. and i did it and it went. boop and she goes oh. wait hold on um and then i and then she looked at me and she was like okay. i i go to. the bathroom and come back. and then you'll and then we'll take care. of it so i went to. the bathroom and i came back because i had to. go without knocking she wasn't just like being like a [ __ ] a weird thing. to say but then she was like go. to the bathroom and uh and so i i came back. after my bathroom and she said it. all worked out and then i and then the lady. goes chris and i and i get it. and she goes boom. and just for shits i was like how many shots is in there. and she said three okay. i ordered four oh so everything. was [ __ ] up but so i was there and i saw as i was doing this. because i was looking around. because nothing was going. right and i was there. for too long i looked around. and i saw a lady with a shirt. that said don't talk to. me and you didn't like that. no i didn't like it. at first because it's like so rude. but it's not personal right. but then it's like if i had that shirt. people would maybe not talk to. me about that kind of [ __ ] is what i'm saying. here's why i don't like it. well i don't like it but go ahead. i it presumes people want to. talk to you yeah it's annoying. it is a little but it's so presumptuous. i know i want to. go up to that person and say i want to. [ __ ] talk to. you anyway yeah i specifically do not want to. talk to you but your shitty. shirt made me come talk to. you i would say that. that shirt probably makes more. people talk to you than not. yes and that's definitely true. yeah do you think she sees. people do you think she sees. people come out tour. and go like this and walk away. yeah probably yeah yeah um probably not but um i don't know. man i need to. get some sort of [ __ ] thing because people are obviously always coming up and talking to. me and [ __ ] and usually it's nice there was a uh chris you remember brittany mcdonald in like fourth fifth grade she wore a shirt that and she was like one of the only girls with this was young girls yeah okay like with the only girls with like about an actual grown in body yet. and over and you talk to. her and you're actually having a conversation. around she goes like this. check it right right. up up right and then i read up you need to. read you need to. get a shirt that says my dicks. down here okay with an arrow. everyone knows that though just i'm just saying but you know. where people's eyes are. too they're not looking at. anyone's what if you got it. sure what if you got a hat. that said my eyes. are down here i think the issue. would be that it wouldn't make any sense. because no one's looking at it. i know i know but that's a good. thing to like make fun. of shirts like oh so you get a hat. that says my eyes are down. here a shirt that says my eyes. are up here my pants. that say you get pants. to say my eyes are way. up there just pants. that are telling you. where the eyes are all. of your clothes directing you. to the eyes and then a jacket with on. the back it says my eyes. are on the other side above. this yeah okay cool merch. that could work um now let me. tell you what i'm insecure. about producer chris said put left a note from me. said don't touch the microphone. now i keep thinking about not touching. it not touching it am. i going to touch it. how am i going to. touch it if i want to. move it that will catch it that's okay. but i just did but don't be ginger. like that gingerly you look. like a [ __ ] [ __ ] well relax you sound so hateful yeah you sound so hateful when you're that's what i'm trying to. illustrate like this just go like this. handle it bro handle. it but don't touch this. what's that about oh oh this. is not this jerking a guy. this is jerking that guy. off like this dude. imagine you know how something. yeah when you imagine doing it. without the actual instrument like yeah. yeah yeah yeah i know. i know but you're like you didn't know. you were like this i don't like so hold. on let me get this. over here let me get this. over here this was good look. how you taught me. yeah that's so obvious. that it does that okay. but anyway don't say it like anyway. it doesn't matter but um so i got a new tattoo i was at the coffee. shop they got me the wrong order. i got the three shots and also the lady. had the shirt and that was my day. and and that was great. so you're welcome for telling you. that um should we get into. the episode of lifeline it's the fourth. episode of lifeline and we've got some bangers. today rob that's what that's what chris. said crystal producer over there. so now if they're not bangers. you know whose fault it. is he said they're bangers. so let's do this. hey what up delia brothers. love you guys love. the new show uh i had a situation come. up that i felt i could get your advice. on uh and it has to. do with the intention behind a joke. that you make to. your friend versus the way. that it lands the impact. and how much of that. impact are you responsible for. when you know it's coming. from a good place. so i had this friend come over. she walked into our. kitchen first time i've seen her in years. and she's wearing this big beautiful. flowy dress and so as i hugged her to. greet her i hit her. with the hills are alive. with the sound of music. uh anyway i thought the hang went. great couple days later. she hits me with a text. demanding an apology for mocking. her and um immediately i flew into. a defensive mode saying like hey that was from a place. of love i was so happy. to see you i would never intentionally like mock. you to make you feel. bad and she wouldn't relent demanded. an apology and so i apologized. i'm sorry but when you apologize. for something like that i think it. takes something away. from you i i really struggled living in the moment for a second uh you know typically i trust that i love my friends. and so jokes are coming. from a place of love and all said i was second. guessing myself life didn't rip. quite as hard it. was it was more like a tear. life tore and i need it to. rip you know what i'm saying. so i guess i just want your advice. would you apologize in those. circumstances that's very specific because but in general would you apologize if someone took offense would i guess the quest that's the example. yeah but specifically if someone took offense to. a joke that you made that you knew. was not meanspirited which that definitely was not. no no i thought he was going. to be like hey you're fat. well that would be yeah obviously. yeah but uh i i don't i mean. i would just be like you you. you're a well here's what i would have. been i mean this. is so weird because if you're that. good of a friend with somebody yeah. you should know what kind of temperament. they have with stuff like that. yeah and it's really odd. to hit them with something like that. and then be so blindsided i'm. not saying that this guy. is wrong in any way. but like it's just odd. that he didn't know that. or maybe she's going through some [ __ ] you're saying know your audience better. know your audience but but but it it. that's so benign that seems so so awkward. so i don't i don't really understand. that's why i'm that's why. i'm hesit that's why i'm i think maybe she's going. through something maybe her family was murdered when the sound of music. was playing yeah just like the hills are alive. and she walks in and the soundtrack's playing and her family's just like hanging right. right right right um i don't i don't know i i don't i don't understand. that this is it's so confusing. to me because it was benign. but i you know it. then it depends on what the friendship. is worth right like if the friendship. is worth like there's there's a difference. between saying i'm sorry for what i did. and then saying oh i'm sorry. you're offended yeah we're right. i think that this calls for one. of those situations i'm sorry. you're offended yeah i'm i'm sorry. you're offended but i completely i'm sorry. i offended you was better. okay i'm sorry i offended. you yeah right but this was a complete. joke right also the sound of music [ __ ] rips yeah right you know what i mean like it's one of my favorite musicals how do you know how i feel about this you could be like yo yo hold on you're assuming that i think that the sound of music is right yeah dude and then be like wes you know what i mean or because you don't want me to. do [ __ ] spin move right. or just prove you love. sounding music and sing more. songs yeah music yeah. be like oh how much do you know. the sound of the music. sound of the music. yeah how do you know. much sound of your music. i mean right forgot. how to speak and then the girl's. like well i don't i know the hills are alive. and from sound of the music. and then you go oh yeah. well check this out and you do. the whole [ __ ] [ __ ] no matter what she's doing from a to. z you do the whole [ __ ] soundtrack she tries. to leave getting her car you get in the car. with her and you're still singing. yeah and then when you're done. you go like this oh so that's how much i know about the sound of music. and guess what sound of music. [ __ ] rips i love sound of music. what i'm saying is when i hug. you and sing that. is i love you. did you know that no. oh you didn't right couples have a ride. home and then yeah and then you can be offended. as well yeah but i do think that there's a big. difference between i'm sorry. you're offended which is like nothing. kind of that's kind of like a [ __ ] thing to. say it's it's okay to. say i'm sorry if i offend. i'm sorry i'm sorry that. i offended you is an okay. apology i'm sorry you're offended is nothing. it's just like i'm sorry at the way. you're made up yeah yeah like think about this. if you [ __ ] on someone right and you thought it was funny okay but i'm just not ever it's not ever funny but if someone's sleeping and you [ __ ] on their neck. okay and then they wake up. and they're like oh my god there's [ __ ] all over my neck. what the [ __ ] paul or whatever. his name is you know he'd come in and paul comes. in like this right. you know what i mean. yeah and he's like did. you [ __ ] on my neck. and i was like isn't that [ __ ] hilarious right. like no i demand an apology. yeah it's like saying i'm sorry. you got [ __ ] on yeah it is that's exactly. right though that's exactly. because it was you dude. that's why i'm sorry. i [ __ ] on you you should always say that if you [ __ ] on somebody yeah but i'm saying it's it's not like saying i apologize that i [ __ ] on you it's like saying i'm sorry you got [ __ ] on by me yeah you're taking no responsibility right now here's the other thing though if you ins. if you demand an apology. from a friend for a joke. that you made yeah you're [ __ ] a weirdo yeah so a good that you i think apologize i don't think you should think about it. like it took something out of you like the it's it's on the other person. for being that offended for demanding. an apology about a sound a music. joke right [ __ ] ease up dude yeah that is a [ __ ] weird thing to. imagine how she responds to. things that are actually offensive. right right she's challenging you to. a duel a sword fight you. know what i mean like what the [ __ ] yeah how how bad is it when you really like pull out the big guns. on an actual insult. does she just like crumble. or like use violence like what. are the you got to. think about like the levels. of offense here yeah. true oh you know what she is. probably some [ __ ] super woke person right gotta be gotta be but that's not even that though i know it's not but i'm sensing things and what we do is we sense things on this podcast okay i didn't realize that was one of the things that you did probably a woke person and okay i'm sensing another thing that this guy's a good guy like he's obviously a good guy because he's thinking about he's a good guy right yeah he's a good guy um and and the fact that she's not thinking about it she's like no i demand an apology period. i think she's a good guy. too she's just got some [ __ ] going on that's right. everyone's a good guy struck. a chord something struck a chord. and i think yeah take the loss. whatever apologize whatever let it go. but like that is a [ __ ] weird thing. to be all up in arms about yeah. i love the sound of music. what are you talking about. yeah yeah that's so weird. that's not offensive at. all not at all we figured it out. for that guy yep and don't really kind of probably. don't really be friends. with that person that's oh yeah. you got it because you got to. be so careful. i know you got to. be so careful. you should just be walking around. like this around that person. all the time and they would say what. are you doing to. be like well i got to. do this because i got a tiptoe around. you obviously because you got so offended. by a [ __ ] musical that i love and the passive aggressive do a spin move and go back. okay let's spin move again. piss me off but okay. all right let's go. to the next hi. guys um we see so many fans. like literal fans um. i am a recovering drug. addict from very hard drugs. deadly drugs and i [music]. have been smoking weed. for two or three months. now after over a year of sobriety. um my private therapist was actually my therapist in rehab and the rule was for her. to be my private. therapist i had to. be sober so i haven't. told her that i've been smoking. weed in fear that she. won't be my therapist anymore. um a lot of people in n. a and a a will tell you that if you do smoke. weed or do anything. mind altering you will resort. back to your drug of choice. eventually which isn't isn't even a thought. in my mind um because i know. it will kill me. so my question is do i tell her. or do i not tell her. thanks guys uh there's a few parts. to that i think and i think one. is if you have a therapist you got to. tell them yeah because they're that's what they're there. for but also i i'm no [ __ ] expert but i do truly believe that weed. is not a gateway wow two other drugs. that are going to. kill you that's my that's a high. intake i'm not actually an expert i feel kind of like i don't even want to. give that advice yeah that's my feeling. because i don't want people to. be like well matt said it. and wind up on a gurney. right exactly that's not what i want. i don't want that at all. that's you don't want to. lay people horizontal just because of your [ __ ] advice but i've always thought that was weird. i know plenty of sober. people oops a horizontal. you know what i mean. about oops did you keep talking over. me okay great okay so you know what i mean. about oops and i'm gonna keep going. right yeah okay so i think that you the i've always been surprised. when sober people say. that they can't smoke. weed but they can't. that's part of their [ __ ] program you're not an addict though. yeah okay but still it. surprises me because i know. a lot about weed. if you know what i mean. right uh you sell it. and it's [laughter] so stupid. it's just it's just i've always thought of weed. is extremely harmless uh i don't see it. as any kind of gateway that being said you do you do have to. tell your therapist yeah you can't. have a relationship with your therapist. or you're like i tell them. ninety percent of [ __ ] but i don't tell them 100 issues there's no point of having a therapist if you're not going to. tell them the entire truth especially if they're your therapist. from rehab you don't want. to hide that [ __ ] from the therapist okay so i think and here we go i think there's something weird going on here okay first of all i don't know how normal it is for your therapist in rehab to. be your therapist after rehab i don't know. it might be normal but i've actually never heard. that actually i've never heard that. so number one that's kind of that. could be like a pink flag. you know what i mean. like almost red okay and there's another thing. here where a therapist shouldn't be say i believe i don't. know if this is true. or not but i i'm pretty sure. that a therapist shouldn't be like well if you do. this i'm not going to. be your therapist anymore. that's true yeah you're not going. to lose the therapist you can't. but but but that's what the therapist. is saying the therapist is saying if you do i'll only be your therapist if you stay. sober so if she doesn't. say sober that what she's saying. is what she's saying her. therapist says you're right i can't be your therapist and you that's a bad. thing that's not right to. do that yeah is to. be like if you do this. i'm not gonna be your therapist anymore. because that just sets her up. to [ __ ] lie yeah that's true yeah yes got into. that one dude i'm making it. about you no but i should be have a [ __ ] phd in this [ __ ] sometimes you say i got out. of that one and you weren't. in it i wasn't in a thing. dude so you need therapy. i know but what i'm saying. is her and i got into. that one yes we got into. that one dude but that's the thing. is that's a very odd. [ __ ] thing to. say as a therapist hey just so you know. we're in ovaries or overeaters anonymous. okay and i'm your therapist for overeaters anonymous. yeah and now that's so hard. to say because no matter what i do. when i say it i [ __ ] it up right reader's anonymous. you did it okay. okay so hey i'm your overeaters anonymous. therapist yeah check it out. you eat doughnuts we can't talk no more. that's [ __ ] it defeats the purpose. you're gonna be first of all you're gonna be like oh [ __ ] i'm scared. i don't wanna [ __ ] up. and i can't tell them if i do second of all. that makes me wanna [ __ ] hightail it. to windchill sure yeah because it's like no no no but when an addict thinks no. no no they go secretly i could probably. get around that right. trust me baby i'm an addict. right you know and so this is a thing. it may not be a gateway drug in the fact that when i get high it. wants me to. i want to. get more high on other [ __ ] yeah but you're still doing the illicit behavior. that's going to lead. to more illicit behavior maybe right. but but you know and i know your argument is oh weed. isn't a gateway drug hey you drink coffee. that's caffeine that's a gateway. drug and if you [ __ ] do it that way every drug is a gateway drug right it's nicotine a lot of sure smoke. right yeah but um but yeah i don't know. dude the the gateway here is lying. the egg right here is. lying you're compartmentalizing your life. and you're compartmentalizing your behavior. and think and you're well some people say it's not a gateway drug that's a slippery slope. dude that's when the [ __ ] boulder is just a snowball at the top. of the hill oh my god. and guess what happens. when it gets lower it. gets bigger and bigger and out. of control and it knocks. down everything in your path. so secretly talking about me. truth though dude that is so you got to. be honest with your therapist. and if they're not going to. be your therapist anymore. then either get back into. rehab or get a new therapist get a new therapist yeah yeah yeah okay you good yeah. i mean i got into. a little bit of preacher. mode that was good that was good i don't have anything more to. add to that yeah. okay all right who wants better. a sex i do oh okay. great do you all you [ __ ] should because the sexy oven. isn't as good as it. could be the best way. to get started on having great.

[ __ ] more and she doesn't well first of all he said should i explore other alternatives. no well well well like what though. porn that's different i mean. like rub some out throughout the week. to like even yourself. out and get on her left and sure if you do you have to. clean up right there because you have a towel but if you mean other options. cheating on her [ __ ] no right no no don't don't cheat on. her but that's he left. it open i'm thinking he's thinking about slipping. and you should not slip. okay don't you need to. do that break up with her. that's a valid reason. to break up somebody true. hey we don't [ __ ] enough sweetheart. gotta go and then go you know. doing someone else and then good for you. you also have a [ __ ] towel to. clean it up later right. right okay but um yeah uh she okay i always say. this foreplay is everything. until you have sex meaning not just in the bed. meaning before that so maybe focus on your partner. as much as you possibly. can because then everything's clean on. your side right. i'm doing all i can you walk. up to say look sweetheart. i'm doing all i can you say. to her [ __ ] i'm doing all i can in this relationship and you don't want to. have sex with me and i don't know. what to do and it's not. [ __ ] working right right. and you leave what if his girlfriend. was in the background she had. a towel on her head too they might that's just how i would they might he might not. even be disguised yeah yeah yeah true. so um man i don't know by. the way that was me. i don't know i don't know i think that you this. is the ageold struggle you. know obviously you want to. [ __ ] more because you know you're the guy and she's the girl and then obviously she doesn't want to. [ __ ] as much because you're the kind of guy that wears a towel and [ __ ] sends a video to. us right actually because that's not sexy. i think that's a that's a common. myth that is actually not true. girls don't like to. join as much as guys my experience yeah. i mean that's not talk. to a lot of women. who've been unhappy with the amount but women say [ __ ] wants to. they say [ __ ] like let's fix up. an old car but they don't. mean but that has now you're pissing me. off why because that has absolutely nothing. to do with anything. yeah and men also just say [ __ ] i know. that so my point. is women in my experience have talked about they don't. have enough sex and they want to. have more sex but their partner. their male partner tends to. want to have more sex. in the beginning and the woman. wants to have more sex. later and the guy's like i'm tired of it. so but anyway this is the classic. typical common [ __ ] complaint but all you can do is meet her at her place. you can't make her have sex. with you more because she doesn't want to. and if someone man. or woman doesn't want to. be having sex it sucks to. be the person that's like can't. we have it more yeah. it's so unsexy that sucks. it's so unsexy and then you have to. think about how you're making the other person. have sex with you and that sucks. too yeah because when you're like if you come in first of all it's not. good for anybody if you're working. hey do you think maybe we could have. sex more because you are like oh i'm a [ __ ] i'm not a man. about it and then she's like what's this. [ __ ] punk ass doing you're so insecure. bad for everybody so you know. what you got to. do dude get your confidence. up take that towel off you. know what you should do you should have. [ __ ] sent in the video with your face. and been like all right. here's what's going on my chick. won't do this my chick. won't do that i mean. he's probably doing it. for anonymity reasons because of his chick. but i'm saying don't be bashful. walk in that spin move mentality. is what you need to. have [ __ ] damn it man you don't need to. do a spin move but if that's a mentality. i'm talking about the spin move. mentality right and you got to. [ __ ] go in with that spin move mentality and walk. up maybe get a new way. to walk but like figure out it's your real. way to walk do you have. a towel on your head when you do this. or you don't have no. you don't have it bro. it's all you and you walk in and you're like sweetheart. we're going to [ __ ] botanical gardens. or something and then you go. there and you think sex the whole time. right okay and you do everything. you can you get her flowers. you make her feel romantic. right because maybe this guy's thinking about how oh i'm the [ __ ] i'm i'm working out i'm being sexy. but you're not being sexy in the way. that she wants to. be she thinks that you should be sexy. right foreplay is everything up. until the bedroom right okay and then [ __ ] there's a book that my therapist says i should read. that i didn't read but she's like in the book. the guy says that you need to. do everything you can always to. try and uh uh everything. for your partner that's the only way. a relationship works is if you do everything. for your partner and it's always on your mind. because then they're going to. feel wanted and appreciated. yeah but what what are you. saying that you're you're saying if you think of everything. as foreplay you're constantly leading. up to having sex. yes so only twice a week. might be okay for you. no i'm saying she'll want to. have it more oh really yeah. because you're being romantic. and [ __ ] i don't know you're being romantic in your life. i mean but here's the thing. what if that doesn't pan. out for him well you got to. break up really you take your towel out. and go somewhere else but what if sex. is like not the most important. thing to him what if he's in love. with her and that's the only thing sounds like sex. is the most important thing. to him true yeah maybe it is right. maybe sex is not the most important. thing to her in which case. it's a mismatch in which case. there's other [ __ ] females out. there that you can join so if everything's good. and he just wants to. [ __ ] more than she does he has to. break up with her damn. that's so extreme it sucks but sex. is what arguably the most important. thing in a relationship i mean. arguably i don't think so one or two i don't know i don't know so it's three no no it depends on who you [ __ ] are man it depends on what your relationship. is like you know some people would say way. lower than three some people would say this. [ __ ] the isis guy would say one casper the isis. ghost would say one i wonder what she would. say casper the isis. ghost you know that's good oh so mad. i said it no. that's great good i'm glad you thought of something funny great. oh good all right uh well i'd say try to. [ __ ] figure out a way that it works. for you if you have to. masturbate a couple times in the week. try it don't just be like you don't want. to [ __ ] enough i'm out try all the things because when you if you break up with her you might be like later on like oh man all i wanted was a little bit more sex and i broke up with that girl i don't know just try it and you know what else you can do is anytime you see like any sort of romance on tv or in a magazine or something and you're with her you could just look at it and then look at her and be like damn sex is awesome huh and then see how she responds and if she says yeah then be like and then move her hair out of the way and then just walk away you know what i mean but foreplay is everything like prove it yeah four plays everything okay you're saying that a lot i know but that that's because that's what i like nixon richard nixon richard dixon all right all right all right nice what's up chris and matt before the pandemic started for me what was simply a minor porn addiction. grew into a wallet. sucking parasite with the growth of only fans wow. the pandemic really accelerated this problem. for me due to. the isolation and how prone i am to. getting addicted to. dopamine chases safarin over the last two years plus i couldn't tell you how much i've spent and now i'm at the point where after my bills are paid i am door dashing just so i can spend more money on there it's a problem i can't seem to. get away from and i constantly wonder how many guys my age. 22 are dealing with this. problem hope to hear your thoughts. and thanks for always reminding me that life. rips well dude i'll tell you what leave that. up there yeah um i'll tell you what uh only fans. is a [ __ ] problem bro. what how how bad baby. that chick she made 50 million dollars. last year on only fans. who's bad baby she's this. chick who uh is like this. 19 year old [ __ ] girl that is unonly fan she was that catch me outside girl oh my god are you serious. 50 million dollars so only fans is a [ __ ] problem how does that make it a problem that makes it sound like a good thing for her yeah right that means that all these dudes are [ __ ] putting in the money that they have to. [ __ ] see this and then a lot of these dudes exist. what's it for it's the person. it's the it's the um the [ __ ] is it personal. nature of it you know. what i mean it's not just porn like i could watch porn. and it's just [ __ ] people [ __ ] and it's cool. i don't have the thought of ooh let me do only fans. because they're just talking to. me so when you say the personal. nature you mean because it's oneonone well. it's seemingly oneonone i mean. but you can message each other. i guess i don't know dirty. little secret this might help. if he's actually suffering because he's like making connections. thinking he's making connections. yeah i know for a fact. for a fact for a so that's a fact. yeah whatever you're gonna say it's a fact. that the women not only fans. yeah who are like bombarded. with messages from men who subscribe. and pay for videos or whatever. the [ __ ] hire people to. respond yeah so and and i know. a [ __ ] guy so you're jerking off she's hired by women on only fans. specifically to respond. to messages that come to. her like hey baby thanks. sexy yeah sure i'll do. this whatever and you're talking to. a [ __ ] guy a russian guy no a guy i know he's not russian well if he's doing it some russian guy's doing it and then you're jerking off to. a russian guy why did you make it. russian well because it's a little bit [ __ ] weirder if you think you're talking to. this [ __ ] 20 year old chick. oh and in reality you're not just talking. to one of matalia's friend. you're talking about to. some russian guy that's just like yeah. that is right let me. suck your [ __ ] how crazy i like to. use lots of spit yeah. you know what i mean. and the guy's just like yeah yeah yeah yeah i mean. why is he beavis. but yeah but so uh and yeah and ali as liaison is. one of those guys so you might be talking to. me you might be talking but oh i would love to. have that job dude. i would love to. make dudes horny on. only fans oh what i would do it. all day i would do talk. about addiction dude i'd do it. all day long what would you write. oh dude i would be so coy. forget it in the beginning. i would play hard to. get okay i would have played great. dude it would be like my golden eye. i would have so much. fun doing it look. give me an example. oh nothing just lounging in an old football. jersey do you know. what i mean okay. that would be the beginning. dude that would be like the select your character. odd job so how about when it's like down the road and like you're really getting a lot. of money to. make like dildo videos you know am i on. my knees i'm underground. oh yeah dude that's me. i'm underground no one wants that. though no that's not true. why are you underground. like a necrophiliac no like i'm so low. below you i'm subservient oh yeah exactly okay. yeah yeah [ __ ] yeah dude yeah weird [ __ ] dude oh yeah you're there not only would i call you the king i would literally call you like lebron oh yeah you're the you're the goat that would be me i'm underground. and you're the goat. bro bro it's slippery you. give it away yeah yeah yeah yeah you need a proofreader just getting my four shots. of espresso in an old. football jersey wait a minute. is this crystalia no no no wait. i have a real thing now. we're talking about i'm dying. and we're talking about an addict here. right yeah this is an addiction. for sure 100 so you're addicted i don't know. if there's he said he's addicted to. dopamine chases yeah well if you know that then maybe actually there's like groups for this there's actual therapy for this kind of [ __ ] if you really want to. stop that might be the only way. because clearly you're aware. of your problem and you ain't. [ __ ] stopping is it affecting your life. is it affecting your uh relationships. is it affecting your income. it is affecting all of these things. yes you're only 22. it started. with a minor porn addiction. and the pandemic wasn't nice. to anyone unless you already had a billion. dollars so yeah so this. guy is struggling and it is a real struggle. yeah clearly you have an addiction. and also if you're using doordash. i mean no he get help. you know what he's saying. he's he's working as a door. down sure oh yeah got it yeah yeah oh just to. make ends meet so you're not even. working for postmates you're working for door. dabs it's not even a postman get help. dude if you have anything to. do with door dash get help. i ordered you don't use postmates. or uber you do if something's not. on postmates and then it's on doordash. and you get it. yeah what's on doordad yo. what are you getting like chalupas. and [ __ ] from taco bell cafe de leche what's that. it's a [ __ ] place you asked me. where i get it from that's where i get it. from yeah but what is it. fast food no it's a coffee. shop do they what are you getting [ __ ] hungry. no no i want coffee. it's just a place that i ordered. from dodats that isn't on postmates. does have a good coffee. it has a good coffee. doordash they show up and they just like throw the [ __ ] at your door. though is it smashed when you get it. oh they do dude. this guy [ __ ] stop being shitty on doordash. basically my advice to. this guy is okay. don't be shitty when you deliver. your food because doordash. sucks and you [ __ ] terrible. what happened to. you on doordash you've got something. going on sometimes that happened. honestly nah it's just i think this. guy's got a real problem. and you need to. [ __ ] get it get your life fixed. but also here's the deal. dude um cut up your credit. cards hide your credit cards um you know. you're not talking to anybody. but some russian dudes really most of the time. haha you jerked off to. russian guys well but he did though. probably at least once so no he didn't jerk. off to russian guys. he probably thinks he's talking. to some woman and it's not. a woman you think you have a person. if you think you have a personal. relationship with someone and only fans. i'll tell you right [ __ ] now you do not okay at all you do not it's some [ __ ] guy or some woman who doesn't give a [ __ ] [ __ ] about you you're she's money to. her but that's kind of some guys. like that like you don't care. about me nice splurt. you jerked off to. to me tree okay there. are guys on on on only fans too right. i'm getting ideas yeah oh dude. i saw an only fans. guy once swear to. god we signed up for it. as a joke okay. not not gay we're not. gay okay it's fine. but it's confined to. matter if you are we did. it as a joke. because we really liked this. guy on instagram and he was [ __ ] so ironically funny like we were just laughing. at this guy he was like sign. up for my only fans and we signed. up for his only fans. dude and he [ __ ] jerked off naked. in the kitchen and just came on the floor. on the linoleum dude and he was [ __ ] i mean he was beating it so hard dude. and it was so funny. because he was like and dude. he was straightening his legs like obviously he couldn't he couldn't bust unless his legs. were really straight and his quads. were [ __ ] tight and dude he was trying to. tighten his quads dude. and he finally came and he almost passed out. and we were dying dude. and when you say we me and the homies. and dude um yeah yeah i didn't know. if you meant you and kristen yeah yeah are you a cow. oh god terrible me and mommy so all you did. was subscribe is only fans. watch them jerk off on the kitchen floor. we're

let me live now this is where honestly and i know you don't like this. but the spin move would work. in spades dude okay. so give me when are you having kids. i am one spin out dude. she's also 23 yeah. [ __ ] live in the moment. dude every time you do something. it's not good enough somebody. comes up well when you're gonna have kids. yeah boom you have a kid. you're happy now oh when you're going. to have another one. yeah my brother or sister. you're happy now you got two. kids oh the question just you know what shoot. right to the question. you really want to. ask when are you dying yeah. right yeah shoot right. to it dude. yeah when someone asks you hey when are you having a kid. go like this i'll probably leave it. to be 95 and that's when i'll die. right yeah cause that's what you're really. asking cut to. the chase let me. live [ __ ] yeah i mean i completely [ __ ] agree i think that uh it depends on your relationship. with with your parents but just generally i think it. should go something like this like ask me. say when are you when matt what do you think you're gonna have. matt when do you guys whenever the [ __ ] i want so aggressive that's it though. that's shitty you know. why that's why they won't ask. again right right that is true. because they're not gonna stop asking they're gonna be sideways. about it they're gonna be this. gonna be that if you come down. hard that one [ __ ] time they won't do it again. that is such a [ __ ] stupid question. for what is it 1824. it's not 200 [ __ ] years ago. right it's 20 22. [ __ ] she's 23. years old yeah yeah spin move mentality your parents. need to [ __ ] relax what are they quakers. i can't remember maybe they are i can't. remember if it was uh she did look. like she could have parents. that would be quakers honestly. yeah maybe but um maybe i think that uh i think that possibly. was she talking about only her parents. doing it or everyone doing it. i thought she said just your parents. i thought that too but maybe not. but honestly everyone does it. and it's just annoying dude. parents friends do it it's annoying. to do that to. someone who's 33. 23 dude or just tell them. you're not gonna have kids hey look i'm not having kids. and if one pops out. great no i'm not gonna have. you know what you could. actually you pushed it back. you push it back. along yeah if you ask me. again never that's the that's the best. that is the best [ __ ] answer if you ask me again. never and i want kids. so if you ask me. again you ruined my. life thanks a lot. that's a good one that's that's yeah. that's it oh [ __ ] dude that's awesome. that's that's that's the that's the end. and then if they ask again. go like this thanks for ruining my life. [music] yeah i mean that's something. [ __ ] nelly out of the [ __ ] thing thanks for removing my life [music]. you thought of that because it's hot. as [ __ ] in here it. is hot but you're the one. who keeps coming up wearing velour. don't don't no but i i i think though. that's so stupid to. say it like you could do. that to your parents. too just don't don't but uh [ __ ] forgot i was gonna [ __ ] oh also dude when she started the video it made it sound like she's like guilty about like enjoying her life and wanting to. travel and [ __ ] that dude wow. you're gonna have whenever you have kids. from that point forward. you're never not gonna have kids. enjoy your life take as long. as you want you're 23. take 10 15. [ __ ] years if you want to. well the womb gets crusty. but okay no 10 15. 20 [ __ ] years people having babies in their late 40s. now [ __ ] your parents [ __ ] her parents well deep deeper don't forget the womb. gets crusty okay [ __ ] your parents the deeper. all right so you want to. do how many more do we have set. it so fast one or two oh only has one and then he said one or two to. make us feel okay. about it he's safer. but it's panicking for him oh sweating. so hard he's gonna get it. let's get it let's get it. let's get it [ __ ] little pump you and then also a little pump this girl okay guys uh my name is channing my boyfriend. and i are both true. babies hell yeah dude. huge fans of both. you oh um so we're both gonna be going. to therapy soon um not together. just separately good and i've always appreciated. the fact that both of you. are very open about going. to therapy and seeking help. um it's not a thing a lot. of you know young men. do i guess that's right. now so i'm just wondering if you have any words. of wisdom or helpful advice. for people just taking that leap. and starting to. go in that direction all. right love you guys. bye i kind of do i think. there's there's one thing that i i think i think when you go. to therapy it's a common. thing to be like i'm not going. to be defensive. i'm going to like i'm going. to like go along with it. and like be open to. the [ __ ] and whatever the [ __ ] and be like if they say something that i don't agree with i'm like think about it and listen and like sometimes you you know you better. than your new therapist okay. so sometimes it's okay to. be like no no no. so let me stop you there. [ __ ] no you're just wrong about me. and that i think people have like a at least i did. i had like a hesitation at first when i started doing therapy about like giving them a long. leash but dude you're there. on your dime that. person also works for you and i don't mean. that in like a customer is always the right. way you're not always right. especially in therapy but i do think that like at least. for me again speaking only for myself. i did kind of overdo. the like i'm gonna be like open. and like listen to. what this therapist is cause they're such an expert. and i'm just this [ __ ] with tons of problems right. which is true don't get me. [ __ ] wrong but at a certain point. you can be like ah no just [ __ ] no and i'm not being defensive. but you're wrong okay do you say you're wrong. to your therapist a lot. have you said you're wrong. to therapists a lot well. no that's you just say. like i know i don't think like yeah. like nah i mean. i know what you're saying. but like i i that's really not where i'm coming. from yeah and what would your therapist. say she go she'd just go like this. no she would just she just says okay. oh i mean like well that's good. she says okay i don't know. what she's thinking right. right she goes like this. okay all right i mean. you know it could be that. in her mind but to. her credit she at least acts like she hears. me and believes me. you know yeah um well i guess. she's asking if um therapy is a good thing. uh and it i i i don't you know. i don't really understand. the clear questions she's saying do you have any she's clearly having a little bit of trepidation. yeah yeah about starting. therapy do you have any general. advice which is exactly what she asked. so i don't know why. okay so that's right. for general advice and not specific advice my [ __ ] is more i give specific advice because give specific advice you're a [ __ ] experience about [ __ ] therapy so okay so um first of all there's a lot of bad therapists out there yes that see yeah do you know why there's a lot of bad everything at every job out there so true yeah i mean think about how many [ __ ] bad really the only job where everybody is pretty good is sports. player yeah because it's a true. meritocracy right meritocracy true and i know what that. word means what does it mean. yeah for about sports. so it's whoever gets the most merit. is the best well. yeah but yes got out of that. one but you don't know. what that means no i do and i do but it's like when it comes. to therapy um you need to. uh figure out if you're like me. i go to therapist and i just think okay. this is it's a great. therapist like i just go in and i think that and then it takes. me a few weeks i'm like wait a second i don't know like i went to. one therapy you do need a few weeks. regardless you do need a few weeks but i went to. one therapist that said [ __ ] nothing he actually didn't use his voice pretty much nothing whoa. really almost it was like dr. wall like he just [ __ ] it was like i was speaking. a monologue in a play a bad. with a bad audience do you think this. was a strategy or yes. it was that it was like a fruity and [ __ ] freudian. yeah yeah it was like a fruity and floridian. yeah uh uh the branch davidian. people say floridian slip. yeah when they're saying it wrong. freudi fraud and slip could. be mistaken as a freudian. slip freudian slip freudian. like sigmund [ __ ] sigmund freud. the what's where it comes. from but when you [ __ ] make it a whole different word you you like gotta like flower it. up when you're wanting to. be wrong yeah fruity and slipped. dying he's dying freudian slip. freudian slip freudian because his name. is freudian say this. word cho chorc say it again. why don't you draw with it. chorc chork you know what i'm spelling. right charar coal charcoal [ __ ] right charcoal people what because people will be like charcoal okay well you're not talking about emphasis you're talking about the actual wrong [ __ ] [ __ ] word let me try to. think about this in a [ __ ] different way dude. okay whatever dude it's fruity it's definitely whatever but it's freudian. and so anyway freudian. okay so what was we telling you. oh yeah it's a freudian. [ __ ] way to do. it is to. just [ __ ] sit back and let the person. talk that's what my other. therapist yeah okay yes that okay. and i'm talking to. this guy and i'm doing it. in the [ __ ] freudian way. yeah for whitian freudian. i mean fruity sounds cooler. yeah that's just not the way. it is so anyway i can't say words. just how they would sound cooler. because then no one would understand. each other you knew what. i meant yeah yes got into. that one so so freudian. slip so um so he was saying [ __ ] like uh nothing and i was like and then i went to. a new therapist and i was like he doesn't really say. much he's like yeah that's a freudian. technique and i was like okay. i'm not doing i'm not going. to go to him. anymore i didn't go to. him anymore so my point. is find ba find out. who your therapist should be first. don't just go to. one and then stick with that. one they're not all good. most of them are bad. just like everything is unless it comes. to a [ __ ] what meritocracy and we both know. what that means so uh i i also think the same. is true the other way. don't be like i'm gonna shop. around if you find someone you like you're [ __ ] lucky and don't not trust that right. if you find someone you like you are lucky. and you are you should [ __ ] thank your lucky. [ __ ] stars that you got it right the first go because that's not common last time. i saw that guy that freudian. guy that does it yeah. uh he had a huge [ __ ] coffee spill. on his shirt like a huge coffee. this guy sucks. dude and i said to. him and i was just talking talking. never saying anything in the middle. of session i said you spilled. coffee on your shirt. huh and he was like yes i did. and he was just like i got coffee. i got a little and i spilled it. and i didn't have a change sometimes i have a change here. and i didn't have one so i'm sorry. about that and i was just like not for me. dude yeah really i'm out. yeah you can't see a client. with a big coffee stain. on your shirt it's your [ __ ] barista. i know so that's a bad look. that [ __ ] whatever i mean whatever dude i mean i'm sure he made a lot of money. but he makes a lot of money. doing it yeah but freudian. or freudian uh therapist they also [ __ ] suck dude. really get your [ __ ] updated yeah i guess so dude i [ __ ] was going to. a lot of therapists i did. that one and then i did another one. that was uh bio. what was it [ __ ] that bio. biodome no with polyamory [ __ ] stephen he was with charlie. probably short charlie sure. it was uh dr wiese. [ __ ] was it called bio. [ __ ] something therapy feedback or some [ __ ] i don't remember what it was what did it do like what did you do he it was for my ocd and he was like he and it was like uh you have to. he was giving me all sorts. of uh ways to. combat my ocd and one of the ways. was have you ever he was like what. about the who cares. technique ooh and i was like what. and he was like so if you don't say. if you don't close. the door right your family's gonna die. in a plane crash and i was like i'm with. you so far speak in my language. and he was like who cares. [music] the worst doctor swear to. god swear to. god that's what he said and i said what yeah. what is it and he was like i'll take a lesser. example say you hop over a crack and you think your mom's back. is gonna break and i said okay. and he goes like this. who cares and i was like well. my mom's back would be bro. that's a bad thing he says and then what. and then i said well then she'd be like bed. written and like pain in pain. deep pain and then what. i said and then and then i don't know. i guess it would last for a few. months and then what i kept doing that. i said then i guess you would have to. go to physical therapy and get better yeah. and then she would be better. right and i said whoa. dude this guy's heartless. yeah bioheartlessness yeah and i was like oh okay. and then he was like that's the silhouette. technique and that was about. the last time i saw him. but i did see him. for a few weeks. um yeah man and uh but there that. is a uh that is a technique i. don't know if it's the so what technique or if it's the it. might it sounds who cares. i can't remember what oh the who cares. yeah but it was funny. as [ __ ] and i i i it's for the little things that make sense but your family. died of playing crap. yeah it's not not so what. dude only you've ever become a [ __ ] jeff. bridges character extremely heartless would you right. you say who cares. oh my parents and brother died. in a plane crash so that. who cares so that. is my that it's mine yeah. i gotta get away. bunch of other therapists if that. happens yeah so uh that is um a therapist that i i stopped seeing so make sure you get the right. therapist what i'm saying i do think it's great. that you're both going to. see therapists individually yes. and not together first because you've got to. figure out what the [ __ ] root of the [ __ ] is and the root of the [ __ ] starts with you and for him the root of the [ __ ] starts with him so coming together after that would be great with all the tools that you learned the therapy i made the biggest mistake one time i was dating somebody and i [ __ ] all over the couch and then i said who cares and then she had a therapist for many years and we wanted to. go to couples therapy at one. point and we were like let's try going. she was like let's try. going to my third. oh and i and i went and i was like all right. this would be great every [ __ ] goddamn [ __ ] thing that came up. she was right and i needed to. do this or or that. or that and i was like could you can. you at least pretend to. not be honest [ __ ] you know you know what you know. what i would think that she would i would think she would air. on the other side if she was a good. therapist at least because she'd be like i want. this guy to. at least feel safe it was him. and i would i thought that too but nope. at the gate wow and meanwhile that woman. who i was dating is. the craziest person i've ever met. wow so that therapist sucked. you know i don't understand well. i guess that's the thing like you if you're with if you're a crazy. person and you and you think i got into. gotta get into therapy. cause you know people say. i should get to. the third i gotta get into. therapy you're if you're a crazy. person you're gonna eventually just weed. out all the therapists until you get one that agrees with you yeah that's oh damn that's a good point you know what i'm saying if you're a terrible person mentally right you're gonna be like this therapist sucks he disagrees with me on everything in real life you're [ __ ] an insane person yes right yes yes yes yes this therapist sucks right talking wolf right you know what i mean and it's like yeah so yeah yeah i'm gonna talk in wolf and i don't mean that in the indian way right
