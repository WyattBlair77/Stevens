[ __ ] out there everyone's just pieces of [ __ ] but mark zuckerberg goes like this yo watch this and then he goes like this hey guys not oh twitter nice but check this out threads [music] and he made threads um and you know now it's a twitter that instagram dude genius tying it into. it into instagram. huh instagram wow. how many 85 years. old genius tying it into. instagram everyone already got the builtin.

[ __ ] out of that sucks. you think i want to. be [ __ ] no but gotta so that's a bonus for me. if as a matter of fact. if i had any other hole on me. any other hole i would be like i hope. that's not a vagina. that would be where my mind. goes right too not up. extra hole dude it's just crazy. so you know if you want to. say that that's conservative. that's conservative i don't give a [ __ ] i mean they got they got they got a uh uh i was just reading. the other day this uh transgender. woman won a competition. um in like some country. beauty pageant for women [laughter]. and like it's funny enough. for the sports stuff to. happen like what you know. what i mean like how how trans. women will beat the [ __ ] at any other. women in sports because they're actually secretly men. but dude the [ __ ] it's so funny and beauty passions. pageants because those women. in beauty pageants are. super like still down with oh. yeah women are beautiful and i'm beautiful. and i don't give a [ __ ] about what like people say. about like stop stop shaming me because i want to. be like a pinup girl. or whatever the [ __ ] you know or be beautiful in my gown like women. can be pretty and and and that's cool. too you know not everyone has. to be a [ __ ] man and uh and i don't mean that in a trans way i just mean that women. you know it's like when men and women. are different and women who do women. who do pageants are cool. with being different right. and so the fact so they super believe in that. [ __ ] so the fact that a trans woman. won that now it you see. all the other women that are just like yay and they're just in their head. it's just like that just [ __ ] just bombs going off. and everything we've everything. the [ __ ] look how far we came we've came we got to.

[ __ ] it's all [ __ ] breaking down i know they got other [ __ ] better. than it this is just the first version. of it dude i don't like it. never mind i'm not gonna see. it okay um i saw this. documentary on uh i think it. was hulu ashley madison documentary bro. you guys know about ashley madison i. didn't know about i i didn't know about astronauts. i did not know about this. series on hulu that they have. um and it's still up. the website ashley madison ashley madison is. a website that promotes extramarital affairs wow. dude you can download the app on apple i'm. shocked you can get the iphone. app this is crazy bro. that this website exists. millions of people just like you are. looking for a discreet connection. so everyday people like you okay. so so here's the deal. i mean this is crazy. look at the website when monogamy becomes monotony this. is so crazy actually i've never seen. this website this is crazy. to actually look at this. did you know infidelity is emotional. while adultery is physical. cheating is a nuanced topic and everyone has different reasons for joining. a dating site like ashley. madison our members are united. in a desire to. seek out wow that is. just wild and then this so this. so in 200 like two look. at this the the quote i cheated on my member. experiences i cheated on my husband. to find companionship and to. feel happy and alive again. i i love how they don't quote the dudes. you know i was looking for [ __ ] craig. idaho didn't get it. by the way couldn't find really anybody you know most of the women. were fat or fake. dude so in 2002. it started they got like you know. a few maybe a hundred thousand. uh people on it which is a lot. but then by like 2007. they were saying that they had like 60. million or something anyway. the dude who was the creator not the creator the ceo. i forget his name something. like ned meter lander. went on a bunch of talk shows and was like yo this is what it. is and everyone hated him. he was like the most hated guy. in the world whatever and so someone hacked. his [ __ ] and exposed everything on ashley madison and expose everybody. they expose everybody on ashley. madison and saying how like uh they give them. a month to defunct the website. and the netherlander guy was like no i'm not doing that. [ __ ] so they exposed everybody people started killing themselves. because they were exposed they were losing jobs. the fact that they were cheating um and our whole time i'm watching this. [ __ ] and i'm just like man. thank god i was never on. ashley madison dude crazy. bro so crazy so now it's still it's still they they got sued. because they were making fake. profiles of women because dude. when you make a website like this there's one kind of person. that are on that's on this. these websites dudes and i know women. cheat too but not like this. dude women don't cheat. women don't go looking to. cheat you know what i mean. women go like this wait a minute. i i i'm in way. over my head i i shouldn't be doing this. they're fixing their [ __ ] i think. it's out of control they'll. say it's out of control. before anything even happened we really. shouldn't be i know but and i by mistake. i i think that we held each other's gaze. too long i know we were at separate. restaurants across the street but we were looking. through the window and i got way. ahead of myself i i i i have they're not even. with someone already i've had i'm gonna have a family. one day with somebody if i meet them. and do dudes go to. the [ __ ] so they they were like and then and then they made fake profiles for women because they needed more. women they were something like something like 65. 60 million this is not but it. was something like 45. million people on it and like 44.5 million people on it. were men okay so it's like all right. if 500 000 women are on. it which is by the way. a lot of women a lot. of women how many of them. are hot how many now let me be let me be generous. let me err on the side. of the positive four you're probably if you're smart. you're probably like probably not even four. hot women who go to. a website to. cheat i mean honestly. men who go to. a website to. cheat ugly pretty safe bet. right no job right so then what do you call it. they got exposed for the fake. profiles and fraud and then it's like they got sued. but not really because they're still in business. they didn't [ __ ] the company up all that much now. they boast 65 million. members online which i don't know how true. that is but dude. hey no [ __ ] you're talking to. someone fake on the internet. dude i don't i don't know if you the internet's the kind of thing. when it's the kind of thing. when you like it's the same. idea as when you like found. out kevin spacey was gay. you know when you if you're talking to. someone fake on the internet. it's the same thing as it's like someone. says oh you're talking to. someone fake on your that. person's fake you go uh yeah maybe oh yeah yeah right. like he's not out there. just like i put a sign up. right in the front window. advertisement right in the front. window and all of a sudden. success coming out of the blue. right he's in dope [ __ ] like seven you know what i'm saying. but now when someone says yo he's gay. connie you go yeah huh. yeah now that's on you to. not know that [ __ ] guys want it to. be real so bad you know. i was at a strip. club once a long long time. ago i'm talking about 20. years with a buddy and this uh stripper was like i want to. hang out with you tonight with me. with a buddy and he was like oh okay he was like wait for me. outside and he said okay. and we're waiting outside and i was like bro. she's not coming out man. she's not she's like i know. i know i'll never forget. it because he was like i know dude. that i trust me. dude i know when someone's lying and she's not lying. and she never came out. of course and we waited. for way too long and [ __ ] drove home afterwards. because dude you got had man. you got had so anyway there's 65. million people that they say. is on ashley madison incredible. but now they can't get their security. was so bad it was so easy. to hack apparently in the documentary. documentary was pretty [ __ ] good i had to. stop watching it uh because it triggered me so [ __ ] hard but um but the uh i am joking. but i did stop watching it. because it was uh i got really tired because i only watch. stuff later tonight so uh anyway uh what do you call. it they [ __ ] what was i gonna say now it now it's got to. be foolproof right there's no way. that they'll get hacked because. it's like going to. remember when jackinthebox killed all those people because they ate a [ __ ] burger it's like after that is the safest place to. eat that's when i started getting. a jack in the box. after they killed a few. people you gotta wait. if you have a fast. food place you gotta wait till they kill. some people because of e. coli and then you can start. eating because they gotta clean. their act up right um did you guys. kill anyone made the drive through. have you guys killed anyone. yet no no all right go. to the next one. you guys kill anyone. yes when 2014 uh i was like yeah. i guess that's good i'll get it. number three how many people did you got kill. okay calvin you can have some too. um yeah i speaking. of killing people i heard that. the fda is investigate is maybe going. to investigate logan paul's. prime energy drink and uh um uh the other guy. uh what what is it. ksi i just followed him on instagram i i remember uh ksi. when ksi and logan. paul were gonna um box. and they boxed but beforehand ksi. was like dude we have to. do like this press. conference can you please come out. and be the surprise guest. and i was like oh yeah let me think about it. and i never got back. to him because i was like what the [ __ ] am i going to. say you wanted me. to roast them i don't like roasting. people also i should have never [ __ ] remember i remember when i when i did that. thing about uh logan. paul i was making my [ __ ] years. ago i make a photo. of him i shouldn't have done. that dude he was going. through enough pain um uh to. be clear i love logan. paul uh what what the [ __ ] is the where'd. it go okay prime energy. drink fda is being because of it. i didn't know this but it has five times. caffeine as cocacola. right isn't that right. is that what it is. six cans of coke. dude and all i say is this. to that dude honestly like being if i'm being totally real honestly. hell yes me after five. sips of prime hell yes. yep a hundred percent dude. give me that [ __ ] i'll go on stage my [ __ ] head will pop off it'd be like that old jim carrey skit when he's playing michael bolton and he goes win a man and his [ __ ] head just explodes for my living color. dude awesome i want all that. caffeine so i love it. props to them. for making a drink finally with enough. caffeine finally right. i don't have to. [ __ ] isn't uh so here an influencer backed energy drink that has earned viral. popularity among children is facing scrutiny. for lawmakers although if you are [ __ ] 12 drinking two primes you know oh that's like 10 that's like 12. cokes yikes i'm sure it's got sugar. in it too um senator charles schumer called. on the food and drug administration. is that is he related. to uh amy schumer i. heard he was although that. sounds like something that somebody would say uh see if they're related. um a beverage brand found by youtube stars logan. paul and ksi that has become something. of an obsession among influence. yeah it [ __ ] apparently in the uk. it's bonkers you can't. even get it um they're related. amy schumer's dad's cousin that. must be why he saw so such a [ __ ] cuck. right here on sunday. charles schumer called in the drug. food the [ __ ] snitch ass. [ __ ] you know family. um yeah so it was an immediate sensation. this is the thing dude. the government doesn't want you making a lot. of [ __ ] money dude they want to. control you this is crazy. dude god damn it i sound. like a [ __ ] biden's a lizard i sound like i'm queuing. on dude what am i doing. i need to stop oh [ __ ] am i queuing. on i'm queuing on. dude [ __ ] that what's after q a q. r i'm aranon i'm run. on rain on aur anon dude. [ __ ] that i'm zionon xenon all right enough dude that joke's not funny and i'm i'm still going dude. look at this a company it. probably does have the same. amount of caffeine as. [ __ ] monster energy and [ __ ] like that i don't know i don't know [ __ ] but um it's like such [ __ ] dude you know what they're trying to. do they're trying to. [ __ ] honestly keep a black man. down and that's terrible. and i mean ksi. not logan paul right. that's it it's it's a race. thing finally good it's a race. thing schumer's racist uh i mean. these titles these [ __ ] titles suspect in 1982 tylenol. poisonings is dead dude. that was [ __ ] 50 years ago. why is this a headline. it doesn't even happen to. him he just died. of old age this is such dude. larry nasser was stabbed in federal. prison jesus yeesh well two and a half. red bulls to. for five stab wounds is worth two. and a half red five. two and a half red bulls. is one prime it is. a lot more that's still yeah. it's a lot more that's a lot. more but whatever though dude. if people know i don't know i go back. and forth on that. uh food thing it's like if you're really. eating mcdonald's the thing is is so [ __ ] affordable is mcdonald's is so affordable it's so although it's not that you can cook man. if you cook if you get the food. and cook fine but the problem. is people need to. work long hours they're single moms. they need to. pay for health care or uh i'm sorry. child care and then they gotta go. home and then i have the time. to cook i want to. spend some time with their kids. so they go quickly at mcdonald's. and the [ __ ] is like four bucks for [ __ ] defeat a family of nine and of course everyone knows mcdonald's is [ __ ] but you know it's like at least the time i am alive i'll get to. hang out with my kids. wow this is actually so sad. great great chris comedy. podcast i love the [ __ ] dude everyone the fact that they're trying to. cancel jonah hill here. because he literally the thing he's only the only thing. he's guilty of is breaking. up with his chick. this is such extreme [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] jonah hill's ex. sarah brady calls him. emotionally abusive because he broke. up with her dude and everyone's like [ __ ] him he's trying to. extinguish her light dude these texts are breakup. texts [ __ ] this kind of [ __ ] makes me so happy i was canceled so i can say this [ __ ] and not be uh like this is [ __ ] horseshit she leaked first of all [ __ ] this for leaking the texts she's obviously heartbroken and whatever but like deal with it on your own [ __ ] and look at this take into. our instagram stories over the weekend sarah who is a semiprofessional. surfer sure by the way. imagine being a semiprofessional surfer. either do it leisurely or be pro. you know it's like you didn't make it. all the way then just make it your hobby. um screenshots of alleged. text exchange between herself and jonah the pair. made the romance public 2021. and uh the message you shared by. her showed a contact she'd saved as jonah. asking her to. remove any photos videos of herself. surfing that showed her ass. in a thong okay. from from instagram so he said yo i don't want you to. have your ass out and that's why. i'm not so that. he said i don't want you. to have your ad basically. what he says i don't have your ass. out because i can't that that's not the kind of girl i want to. be with and then she was like so they broke. up and then she's like and then she took the by the way. two years later right. or a year later i don't even know this. is a warning to. all girls if your partner. is talking to you like this. make an exit plan love. y'all call me if you need your all the posts are removed from my page. she said he said good. start but you don't seem to. get it but it's not my place. to teach you i've made my boundaries clear. you refuse to. let go of some of them. and you've made that clear. i hope it makes you happy. he says that one that. isn't of your ass and i think she's not a thong. but okay as far as other pictures. you are in a bathing suit. surfing or not he says i'm done. there's tons i'm just going back. the past month you want. to argue and i don't you're done. what does that mean. i'm just over explaining myself so he broke up. with her here we go. oh here we go this. was it he wrote plain and simple. if you need surfing with men boundary lists. and appropriate friendships with men to. model to post pictures of yourself. in a bathing suit to. post sexual pictures friendships with women. who are in unstable places. and from from your wild. recent past beyond getting a lunch. or coffee or something. respectful then i'm not the right. partner for you if these things bring your place. of happiness i support it. and there will be no hard. feelings these are my boundaries from romantic. partnership my boundaries with you based. on the way so this. is what he said and then she posted. all these screenshots like he's emotionally. abusive dude he just didn't want. your [ __ ] he didn't want to. be with somebody and i don't by the way. i don't even think what you're. doing is wrong i don't give a [ __ ] dude. if i had a [ __ ] girlfriend that did that [ __ ] do it all day. long i don't care i don't think what you're doing. is wrong but dude. to try and get the mob to. come after somebody shaming them because dude. this will break up he didn't want. to be with your ass. he didn't want to. be with you and he set up. a bunch of i don't want to. have somebody in my life that dude. it's like and now because he said this. everyone's coming after him oh [ __ ] him she he's trying to. put out her light he's trying. to control what happened. to [ __ ] he's standing up. for what the [ __ ] he wants dude. if the rules reversed and a woman did this everyone would be like oh dude. well you know he couldn't respect. her boundaries dude it goes both ways. he doesn't want
