my old friend but um yeah and not so much darkness but that's what's up um so yeah life's been okay you know we've been having a good time um i gotta be honest man uh i put up a story the other day on my instagram about how my ocd was just [ __ ] killing. me and i don't normally. post stuff like that uh because. you know i don't i don't know. if social media is supposed. to be for you know. emoting so much but i know. a lot of people do it. and they feel it and and and it's good. for them and and it's their it's their brand and it's not. really mine uh because i just kind of come. on here and [ __ ] and i do jokey stuff and i talk about like [ __ ] hugh jackman but like um you know i i i was really i was taken. aback by how many people um [music]. were struggling with that as well. um i i basically um i couldn't leave the house. i couldn't get out uh i was just stuck. in a loop and i don't know. if you know how serious uh you know. i make light of it. a lot but like i really have uh a [ __ ] pretty hard case. of ocd and sometimes it's [ __ ] real tough um and i was just stuck. dude i was stuck in my house. and i couldn't leave i couldn't move. um and my anxiety. was just [ __ ] killing me. it was getting the best of me. and uh it was anxiety. and ocd and i was [ __ ] i was just i i think i had therapy earlier and i was just really really really just struggling and i finally got out. of the house um at like three which is so late. for me man and it was so [ __ ] hard um and i was just [ __ ] up all day uh and i just i was just taken aback by how many people reached out and said like i i really appreciate you sharing this because it's a struggle too it's nice to. know that like you suffer. from this i mean not not this. nice to know that anybody suffers. from it but like that like they're not alone. i guess um but yeah man. i you know i think that sometimes. it's weird because the internet. like looks at people i don't mean. to get so [ __ ] i usually like to. start with some [ __ ] funny [ __ ] but like it's weird to. see that like some people like on the internet. especially like celebrities you know you see them. getting dragged for all sorts. of [ __ ] and like just people think that their lives are amazing like i look at like guys like the rock or whoever um and i just wonder what their life is really like because you know he's a person. and i know it's go go. go but all it takes is like a certain moment. to just realize oh [ __ ] man i've been really going too hard. or really been not taking care of myself. and my mental and uh i think that that's important. you know sometimes you coast. through therapy or sometimes like i go to. my meetings and i like i i i don't know i feel like i'm on autopilot or something. but like i don't know it. just hit me that i was not like taking care of myself. and i just had a [ __ ] rough few days man. um i went on stage. and i kind of tried. to get through it i thought it would get better and um you know it's up. and down but um i just want people to. know that like i'm i know. that like you come to. me for like humor and [ __ ] and i said i wasn't feeling funny. today i just really appreciate you. guys listening because like um and i feel like you know. since the response from my post. which i don't normally share. i mean i even had like some like celebrities reach out. and they were like oh you know. yeah i suffer from the same. thing and it was just like wow. you know it was nice for me. to know that i'm not alone. you know because i think sometimes people look at people. who have 2 million. followers and they're like that guy knows what the [ __ ] life's all about it's just like it's a constant [ __ ] thing where you're trying to. figure out you're trying. to grow and you're trying. to understand yourself and how you're uh managing your life. and it's not perfect and it's [ __ ] messy. and um so you know um yeah you're not alone. dude i i my ocd. was [ __ ] killing me. man like [ __ ] i don't even like thinking about it but it was a [ __ ] struggle um you get stuck in like a loop. and i don't even want to. like get out it's hard. for me to even. leave a room because i leave a room. and i get terrified like dude. i leave a room and i get [ __ ] terrified that i left. the room the wrong way. or something or like i left. something in a wrong way. and somebody's gonna die. or get cancer or some [ __ ] or whatever the [ __ ] man something's gonna happen. to my family and it's [ __ ] so weird [ __ ] i never see that [ __ ] movie with hugh jackman with the robots. where he's just like [ __ ] what's that. robot [ __ ] thing were they punching they're punching [ __ ] heads and [ __ ] what is it called real real deal dude real steal [ __ ] was that [laughter] [ __ ] hugh jackman gonna be making that movie and i'm [ __ ] trapped in my [ __ ] bedroom i'm just gonna be making real steel while i'm [ __ ] thinking about how my whole. family's getting cancer when i turn on the goddamn shower. [ __ ] off you're just gonna make real steel huh. yeah what's it about. robots all right well let's make it is crystalline. stuck in a room all right. and action [ __ ] being ripped this [ __ ] just so ripped on [ __ ] tea all right. i've only eaten meat and [ __ ] lettuce. reps just get off the set. of wolverine let's make a movie. with robots hold on i need to. check something is crystallized. trapped in a [ __ ] room because he can't leave without thinking his family's gonna die. in an airplane air right. and action so don't think i'm gonna be all [ __ ] walls down the whole time. and not bring up [ __ ] goddamn hugh jackman. and some of his [ __ ] ass movies to. [ __ ] even it out baby. because we gotta even. it out dude the walls go down. you start with the waterworks well. hugh jackman's getting it. immediately dude all right. and don't think i didn't [ __ ] see whatever that other one. was where he was trying. to with the whip and the [ __ ] hat that like what's his name would wear from the gorin. brothers the [ __ ] one where where he's doctor he meets. dr jekyll mr hyde and frankenstein and all. the shits and and [ __ ] the [ __ ] it god damn it. hugh jackman with. the long hair and kate. beckinsale's in it captain pink. himself in it ben helsing dude. whoa and isn't that a [ __ ] because i took two gabapentin today. and that's why i forgot van. helsing dude but whatever dude. the walls come down and we make fun. of hugh jackman and that's how we culp because that. is how we cope with with humor. and i realize i just want people to. like me man you know. why can't that come from. me right i don't know i don't know i don't know you sit and you talk. to your therapist and you ask them. why am i like this. you know it's like that. [ __ ] meme with the guy in the mirror. where's like why are we like this. that's me dude that's me. at therapy why am i like this. and she's just like well why don't you take. me back to day. one and i'm just like don't pull that. hacky [ __ ] with me man. oh really my childhood. okay really that hacky [ __ ] so i gotta talk about how [ __ ] trauma happens. over a long period. of time because i was never [ __ ] fingered you know it wasn't one. immediate thing that happened it was just overtime. right so uh yeah uh yeah just trying to. figure it out dude. so what i'm trying to. say is real steel. is [ __ ] terrible no matter what no matter what you think no matter what they think and most of the time the feelgood movie. of the year is not the feelgood. movie of the year okay that's all i'm saying that's why i'm saying top gun. can't be as good as it. [ __ ] possibly am i even making any sense. why do you listen. dude [ __ ] why am i like this. why do you even why. do we listen my babies. um i'll tell you what i started. this podcast because i wanted to. talk about [ __ ] [ __ ] i want to. talk about silly things and that's it. and then you got to. know me and whoopsie daisy okay. now you know me. a little bit and i don't know. how to [ __ ] keep doing this. podcast i got to. keep talking right i got to. keep talking and now you're going. to know about all my life. and everything and all the [ __ ] stuff going on in my head. but whatever dude uh at least. i [ __ ] you know what i tried to. do the other day i looked at my son. and uh i often tell my son i love you. bud i but i often say. it like do you know. how much i love you. you know some [ __ ] like that do you know how much dad dad loves you and i was like you know what dude. he's two i'm gonna [ __ ] say it like a 40 year old like a 40 year old telling another [ __ ] who's 40. i love you i'ma. pull no punches so i walk up. to him and i say hey calvin come. here and he's playing with like [ __ ] napkin. holders or some [ __ ] he's got 900 toys he's playing with jingly napkin. holders and uh you know or he's playing with that. [ __ ] little fish. magnet game where he's trying. to do the fish. but he's getting real frustrated. because he can't do it. and and then kristen told him. to just put it on the refrigerator and and now it's just a magnet on the refrigerator and she was like it's magic and he now he's like um i'm like great. now he believes in it. okay good now he believes in [ __ ] magic good. now he's gonna believe in magic. dude you know who also believes in magic. me when i turn on the shower. i think my family's gonna die. in a plane crash how about that. that's magic so great now. we started ocd with calvin. now [ __ ] calvin's sitting there he's gonna be like where are the portals mom when he's eight he's gonna believe in [ __ ] gizzards and i say gizzards because that's how he says wizard so uh he puts the [ __ ] magnet on the thing and then she's like look magic dad that look what i did magic and for the first time he put the [ __ ] thing in the refridge and he [ __ ] looked at me like what do you think dude that was cute. as [ __ ] so i'm like i might tell him i love him i'm gonna tell him i love him like a 40 year old does another 40. year old he loves him. and so i look i look him. in the eyes and i said kevin. i got to tell you man. i love you i love. you i love you so much. do you know i love you. so much i love you. so much and i love my job. you know how much dad. loves his job when he goes to. work and he said yeah. and i said i love you. more than that and it doesn't even. compare how much more that's how much i love you. i would give up anything. for you i love you. that much i love you. more than anything in this. world and you know what he said. he looked at me. right in the eyes and he said i guess. i need a raisin and walked away. is there anything more like seriously. think about it any out of any age. group is there. anything more disrespectful to. respond to to that sentence. is there anything more disrespectful. to not even be first of all. ray who the [ __ ] eats raisins right. whoever even wants a raisin. raisins are [ __ ] horseshit you know what i mean every time i see raise. it when's that time you ate a dude. if you've eaten a raisin. in the last [ __ ] i don't know. 10 years i mean. i get i get it. if you're just like in the 90s. eating raisins because like you saw a [ __ ] uh what a [ __ ] commercial where people are like running around in fields with sunlight peak you know what i mean i don't know like what's that [ __ ] raisin seems like that would be a raisin commercial but like there's no raisin commercials. now anymore you know. don't eat raisins and so like i say i love you. so much i love you. more than anything more than my job. which by the way is a step. for me because i thought i had to. like comedy more. than anything to be good at comedy. i thought that up. until my family became what's important. i thought that standup was the goal. but it's not [ __ ] all that [ __ ] family right so now this is a step for me. and i tell him and i'm already. like wow i'm making progress. in my life admitting to. my twoyearold that hey your dad. loves you more than anything. and this dude not only does he want. to ra he is not even. sure he wants the [ __ ] raisin that's how disrespectful it is he's it would be light years more. respectfully he was like so you know what i'm hungry. for a raisin but he was just [ __ ] dilly dallying. walking around saying i guess. i need a raisin the most disrespectful. anyone has ever been to. me and i made him it's like the moment. in the godfather where al. pacino is just like don't ask me. about my business kate. don't ask me. about my business it's like the end. when she's like i just want to. ask one thing did you kill. him and he says you can ask this. one time you can ask this. one question what's the question. and she's like did you kill. him and he looks at her. and he says no and you know. he did that was my son. i guess i need a raisin. but i just want to. tell you i love you. more than anything i love you. more than my job i guess i need a raisin. oh yeah i guess i need a raisin. oh boy you want to. tell me you love me. more than anything oh yeah oh and not nice i love. al pacino dude the best the best because he's the best and the worst dude. al pacino will be uh make a [ __ ] dopey [ __ ] ass movie and then he'll go and make a real some real shitty movie where he's just acting too much. in it and then he'll [ __ ] surprise you and play like dr. kevorkian on showtime and you're like whoa. bro where was this. oh yeah euthanasia yeah. oh yeah oh of course i believe in it. oh i know it's against the law. but i think it's right. isn't that right clergy man. how many times has he sent. something like that and dude. al pacino only picks me i said this but i must have said this before. alpacino only picks movies where he could. do long monologues that make no. sense until the end he'll play. like a [ __ ] movie with his father with his with his son that's estranged and and he'll be like it'd be like dad you want to. play catch and he'll be like do you know. how they make a kobe steak. it's not like a regular burger. they take that cow. they get it nice and drunk. they liquor it up. they massage that cow. they get the meat nice and tender. where's that ball what and the award. goes to al pacino. in isn't that right clergyman [laughter]. you know i wasn't gonna take this. roll but oh yeah i did just always getting sucked off you know i wasn't gonna take this roll. but oh my oh yeah ha. sorry i'm busting under. the podium oh all in your mouth. um oops all over your face. oh i made a mess [laughter]. you know after he spunks he does. some crazy [ __ ] like that oh yeah well i made a mess um oopsy daisy call me. crazy and then moon walks back into. the bathroom huh but you didn't know. i know how to. do that clergy man what. the [ __ ] girl just like last time i hooked up with him. he's a [ __ ] insane person you know how to. make a copy site. in the bathroom um anyway dude. what was i even oh yeah my son. ah so that's what's up. i don't know i went to.
